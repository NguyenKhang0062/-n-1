2.0,21 December 2019,"I've got nothing against movie musicals, director Tom Hooper, or even anybody who's a part of making this film. But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.

While I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.

There's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.

First, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.

Next, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.

Hooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.

The pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.

In that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.

Cats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.

That story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.

A little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.

Francesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.

There's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.

As a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.

So, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.

In short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.

There's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible."
2.0,20 December 2019,"I can't imagine how much the actors must've been paid to have this in their resume. From Swift to Elba, JHud to Rebel Wilson. Judy Dench, even! No amount of acting talent could save this sorry excuse for a self-indulgent furry fantasy"
2.0,28 December 2019,
1.0,25 December 2019,"There is a wall in my house. The wall is a simple wall, eight feet tall, and fifteen feet wide, it sits in a corner in the basement. It has been painted beige, with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before. It's got it's idiosyncrasies, the way the light jumps off the paint, the not so even drywalling underneath. Stare at it long enough, and it begins to speak to you - or at least allow you to speak to it. Maybe there's something to the wall - or maybe it's just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it. My point is this - staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring, interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is ""Cats."" A film so awful, so ridiculous and so void of substance its very existence is an affront to musicals, film and theatre. Unless you're a fan of 'so bad it's good' cinema, stay away. This is a watershed moment in bad movie history.

1.0,2 February 2020,The most entertaining part of this entire movie was reading these hilariously bad reviews. It was SO boring and hard to watch.
1.0,5 January 2020,"In 25 years this film will have a weird cult following, and an aged James Franco will make a ""meta"" film about it. Until then, it will remain universally regarded as an utter shambles."
1.0,25 December 2019,Honestly I wish I was joking. Just everything was completely terrible. James Corden was cripplingly awful but that's nothing particularly surprising. Leaving the cinema I'd felt as if my soul had been sucked dry. Avoid at all cost.
1.0,24 December 2019,"This film is truely a masterpeice in unintentional horror. The effects are so special I'm going to have nightmares for weeks to come. Why they didn't just dress the actors in costumes and makeup I have no idea, either the filmmakers are lazy or someone wanted to push the boundries of visual effects. Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley. The design and look is freakin disgusting.

I never saw the stage musical, so I didn't know what I was in for. This movie that has no plot, it's just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves. I tried to enjoy it as a so-bad-it's-good cringefest, but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossible.

If you can't even look at the screen without feeling annoyed & disgusted, it's impossible to enjoy it in anyway.

Thanks Tom Hooper."
1.0,25 December 2019,"I'm not a praying man, but I was praying so hard for this movie to end. From the fist minute, I knew this movie was going to be a disaster. What a waste of talented actors."
10.0,12 January 2020,"If I thought I had any will to live before, this movie destroyed it. I went home traumatized, my beloved cat of 4 years was on my bed sleeping and I almost called the adoption center to put her up on their listing. I didn't get rid of her, but I can never look at her or other cats the same way again.

Rating -60/5"
6.0,18 December 2020,The most well thought out horror movies ever. You'll never ever look at your cat the same again.
1.0,30 December 2019,"I'm probably going to get attacked for this, but I didn't think the movie was that bad. Yes, the cats had human teeth but what do you expect when it's a group of humans, dressing up as cats? The singing was great and the dancing/choreography was also phenomenal. The cast and crew work really hard and hey if you hate it, you hate it but I'm just confused as to how the reviews are so awful."
1.0,21 December 2019,"I...it just...I can't....I...I got nothing.

Theatre is theatre for a reason."
1.0,21 December 2019,This is what Dante saw in one of his dreams. also this is traumatizing for children so if you are 22 or older go watch it.
1.0,23 December 2019,My body and soul was not ready for what I just witnessed.
1.0,25 January 2020,"""Are we both having strokes?"" That was my girlfriend's review Still not sure but I think my brain weighs less now"
1.0,20 December 2019,"Not entirely sure what I just witnessed but man, that was.......weird. Went in hoping it was gonna be so bad it was good but alas it was so bad it was just plain awful. Self-indulgent & oddly even the A-list cast seemed terrible. Kids will love it no doubt, grown-ups not so much."
1.0,22 December 2019,"Do not watch this under any circumstances , this movie is a dangerous to your mental and physical health"
1.0,20 December 2019,Not a lot more I can add to the reviews that have already been written. The directors obviously thought that by throwing a load of A list actors at this it would somehow make up for it's short comings. James Corden was terrible (as usual).
10.0,24 December 2019,"Rise of the skywalker ""im the worst movie of 2019""

Cats ""hold my coat"""
7.0,12 March 2020,"I got to get real with you. Before this movie, I had high functioning depression. I tried all the methods of beating it. I took meds, I snorted curry, but nothing would stop it. Then the trailer dropped. It was like the clouds parted. Seeing James Corden as a cat was all I needed. In the days to come, I looped the trailer over and over. I couldn't get enough. When the movie came out, I bought the first ticket, trampled a girl to get in, and sat in the first row. And all my sadness dissipated. It was beautiful. In that moment I had an out of body experience. Seeing Judy Dench lick her leg and watching Taylor Swift being slightly less annoying than usual all combined with James Corden was too much. I got home that night and threw out all my meds and curry. I didn't need them anymore. Since then I have devoted myself to watching the movie five times a day while sitting on my head. I am the proud owner of so many cats, I lost count. My neighbors think me strange and Dad said something about disowning me, but it matters not. I have all I need. I no longer shower so I can make time for this glorious masterpiece. The sight of Jason Derulo crawling around alone is enough to wash my body clean enough for years. My hair practically cleans itself now. I can only hope you experience this meowsterpiece in the same way I did. Cats gets a 10/10. It's the least I can give it."
1.0,24 December 2019,"Cats is incredibly surreal. It's barely a movie, I don't know what it is.

Now, don't get me wrong, it was hilarious. The wonky facial expressions, lingering songs, and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot. Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie. For good reason. There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously (a young couple on a date. Oops, that's a poor choice of movies), but they turned around by the end of the ""film"" and started chuckling.

It's so strange how a piece of media like this can exist. Despite how unwatchable it is, the movie was weirdly hypnotizing. Well, I guess we are one with the jellicles now. Whatever that means."
5.0,6 January 2020,
1.0,20 December 2019,"CGI mess of a movie with caterwauling ""stars"" in ugly costumes and abysmal dance numbers based on the hit Broadway musical.

The movie is ugly to look at and is an assault on the ears with Jennifer Hudson screaming at the top of her lungs and every other ""singer"" shown in loving close-up as they mug through their numbers. This includes Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift and others.

Really, I thought Hudson was trying to cough up a hairball. She should have. It would have been the highlight of the film."
1.0,23 December 2019,"Hyped as the worst film of the decade so much that it didnt seem THAT bad while watching. Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just ok.

The first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilson's song is disturbing, at least to me. After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining. The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper, was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat. Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson. She was good. If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was, it would be much better. McKellen was very good as well.

Look, CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience. It's an acquired taste. It's not for everyone. Some parts (cough) Skimbleshanks, were very well done while other parts (sneeze) Rebel Wilson's song were atrocious."
1.0,29 December 2019,
1.0,22 December 2019,"I'm currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the 'film' I just saw. It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through, and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster. The tone was all over the place. James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture. Jennifer Hudson's melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional. Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible. I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered. Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply 'say' a line as opposed to 'singing' it isn't edgy, it's just worse. The whole thing is so misguided that I'm sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow."
1.0,8 February 2023,"So so so terrible. From acting, to singing, to plot, it is all so horribly bad. BUT the worse of all is the CGI and use of technology. It doesn't even come close to looking good. Things float and move around, mostly their feet, that it looks so laughable.

I recalled that I had heard it was bad, but that was 3 years ago. I didn't remember the what or why was bad about. Heck, the world experienced the COVID pandemic a few months after this movie was released. Anway, I received free HBO for the weekend, saw this, and decided that I had to see it for myself. I wished I would've come to IMDb to reminded myself about the bad the comments and reviews.

I'm not making a joke here: I'm honestly surprised that HBO is even showing this still. If any of these actors have any kind of self-respect, they would demand that this film is never shown again. Stay away; far away. Wear a mask and don't get contaminated by this show."
1.0,27 January 2020,As Phoebe said.... My eyes! My eyes! What have I just watched? I wish I could get partial amnesia or something and forget this experience.
10.0,28 December 2019,"The reviews are right this time. The cast does its job just fine. The songs and dances are well performed. It's a shame, because I feel terrible for the cast. It's not their fault. I don't think they knew what visual effects were going to be applied with CGI in post.

This film is unintentionally one of the greatest horror movies ever made, worthy of recognition alongside The Exorcist. You are that uncomfortable as you sit through it.

Whoever gave the final go-ahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. The characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. They fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this ""the uncanny valley."" This movie is more horrifying than ""It: Chapter 1"" if you are a coulrophobe.

I would rather it were ""Spiders."" You would at least know what you're getting into then and I cannot stand spiders.

The most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. I felt like the Nazis at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I thought my face was going to melt off.

My friends and I went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but it's so visually horrid that it held us tight in its Uncanny Valley grip for the whole of its two hours. Who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats' appearances and said, ""That looks good. Let's go with that!""?

If you go, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. This movie will horrify them far more than anything Pennywise the Clown could come up with."
6.0,26 December 2019,Wanted to see if the movie was as bad as the reviews suggest. It was.. and more.
1.0,29 January 2020,"I went to the theatre with my little brother and when we left, he was crying. I wasn't expecting it to be this scary but it sure delivered."
1.0,20 December 2019,"Outside of a few extremely weird moments, CATS is neither as consistently weird as you want it to be nor as good as the film thinks it is. You get used to the CGI after 5 minutes and after that, it's just the stage show. If you like that, you'll like the movie. I liked the movie a bit more than I liked the musical (for reasons that will become apparent) - but I also really don't like the musical.

The script adds a bit more of a story than what is found in the musical, but it's never really able to turn the film into anything more than a collection of vignettes where various Cats explain why they should be the ones to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a version of Cat Heaven) and be given a chance at a new life.

The CGI isn't as monstrous as you fear, though there are plenty of times it doesn't work. Hooper films this movie in exactly the same method he filmed the Les Miserables film - lots of extended closeups and very long-lasting wide shots. The wide shots do a good job at showing off Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography, but the closeups are very unsettling.

Unfortunately, the movie is only REALLY weird for about 30-40% of the time. The rest of it is fairly monotonous and it just sort of numbs you. I'd argue it's worth seeing for those weird moments - because they're REALLY weird. But, at the end of the day, if you don't like the musical, there's no chance you're gonna like this movie - because it's just the musical with slightly weirder costumes."
1.0,4 January 2020,"I too was once innocent. I lived in a pure, bright world full of hope. In my naïvety, I said ""surely it isn't as bad as they say."" Never have I been more wrong in my now God-forsaken life.

I can only hope that whoever created this atrocious disease of a film enjoyed the copious amount of drugs they must have taken to decide this should have been made. I would need even more than they were on to make it through the movie again without ending it all in the movie theatre with a plastic straw.

Also we need to save Judi Dench from whoever has forced her to be in this cinematic representationr."
1.0,2 July 2020,"I have been a big fan of ""Cats"" over the years and I even have the stage soundtrack on my USB stick to play in the car. In 1998 they released a filmed a stage version, masterfully performed, but with cameras set up from various points to get both full, wide shots and very intimate close-up shots. There is no audience applause at all, so it was probably filmed only with the cast and crew present. To me that is the definitive film version, a real ""10 of 10"" for fans of the musical.

With that as a background I watched this new movie version last night on BluRay from my local library. While it is not nearly as bad as many are rating it (as of today it has 48% votes of ""1"") I found it to be a bit too cheesy I suppose in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. Inclusion of such famous personalities as Rebel Wilson and James Corden to play overweight cats in attempts at humor didn't work at all. And Taylor Swift, bless her little heart, just isn't a good enough singer to do the solo number assigned to her character.

So, while much of it was entertaining, and I loved the extended tap-dancing scene along the rail tracks, overall it is just a shadow of the properly done stage musical. The attempts to scale it up to include a broader set of London locations just doesn't work very well.

Surprisingly, Ian McKellen, who isn't known for his singing, is actually very good as Gus the Theater Cat. I like Jennifer Hudson, a gifted singer, but in her attempt ""to make it her own"" just didn't come over well singing ""Memory."" Elaine Paige did it on stage so much better and once you have seen and heard that then the other versions just don't compare.

And finally Francesca Hayward, a ballerina, has the role of Victoria, a discarded cat new to the Jellicle Ball and who serves as narrator. She has a couple of songs and while she doesn't have a powerful stage singing voice she actually was better than some of the ""personalities"" that were added to the cast to help draw viewers.

So, I'm glad I watched it, as a fan of the ""Cats"" stage musical it was fun to see a somewhat different take on the story, and the extras on the disc are interesting, but overall this is probably a movie that should not have been made."
1.0,29 January 2020,"Just try and make it through just the trailer! Then think about how many people in the world could have been helped by that money. Think about how many people may need therapy if they manage to sit through this feline disaster. I always held 'Slime People' as my nominee for worst film ever made (budget was $56,000 in 1963) but this has replaced it."

1.0,28 December 2019,
1.0,8 July 2023,"I am far from an expert on musicals and my singing and dancing are subpar, but I thought Cats was ok. Not this movie but the play/musical whatever it's called with real people on a stage. This abomination gave me nightmares and I am an old dude. The story, music, and acting could have been amazing, but no one will ever know because visually the entire film is like a million fingernails scratching slowly down a million chalkboards. It was like Gilbert Gottfried singing the most beautiful song ever, the song itself is still good you just never know it because it is dressed in the worst visual effects ever. And James Corden, how is he a thing? He isn't funny, his voice is the vocal equivalent of the visual effects of this movie. I would rather put leaches on my eyeballs than be in the same universe where this doucherocket exists."
10.0,30 December 2019,"From the first 3 seconds of the movie, I instantly regretted my decision to give it a chance. My only consolation is reading the reviews of others who have suffered as well."
7.0,25 December 2019,"James Corden seems to have been stuck in the film to appeal to his American following, he certainly wasn't chosen based on his acting or singing skills. A truly awful film with no one getting pass marks but Corden was particularly dire."
1.0,26 December 2019,Worst movie ever. So bad my wife left to go shopping.
1.0,18 December 2020,"This is one of the most well thought out horror movies. After I watched this, I had a deathly fear of cats for two months. I would recommend it, but not if you have a cat."
1.0,3 January 2020,"I really don't know why this film is getting so much hate. It's a fun piece of whimsy based on the hugely successful stage play of the same name. Tom Hooper has put together a star studded cast, created a coherent plot that links together the various musical pieces and it's a great experience. It starts off slowly but once it kicks into high gear, it's mesmerising through to the end. Just like the stage play it makes little sense, street cats gather to perform for the old matriarch Queen cat. She will decide which of them deserves to be elevated to a new life. Makes no sense but neither do cats in real life. The effects are great and yes they are cat people, THAT'S THE STAGE PLAY TOO!!! In a world where we are happy to have Bradley Cooper voice a humanoid Racoon but we freak out about people looking like cats then I have to suspect all the fuss and negativity surrounding this is just false offence. It's not got a huge amount of replay value but it was great and definitely worth catching on the big screen. Francesca Hayward was fantastic as Victoria, her dancing is incredible, Idris Elba was menacing as Macavity Jennifer Lawrence has some serious pipes. For me, one of the standout performances was Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap. Does it say anything about our humanity? Does it have a deep rooted message that will change you? No. Does it showcase the weirdness and self indulgence that your household cat, sitting across the room from you, quietly judging you, displays on a daily basis? Yes."

1.0,20 December 2019,"The only thing that could have saved this movie, Was for it to have never been created to begin with."
1.0,24 December 2019,This may sound a bit harsh on the movie. There are a lot of big names. But this is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. There is no plot. Taylor Swift is only used as a promotion. I don't like giving bad reviews. But I have never used my life more stupidly than deciding to watch this film. Do not waste your time on it.
2.0,31 December 2019,"When you give a karaoke competition third runner up an Oscar for effectively playing herself, you're asking for trouble. And though it's taken many years, that festering sore has finally burst through the skin with Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory in this shockingly unpleasant movie version of a shockingly unpleasant stage show.

To be fair to the makers of this abomination, the source material they had to work with is the real problem here - a painfully stupid and tuneless musical based on a collection of poems about cats, the writer of which could never in his wildest dreams have imagined someone would make into a stage play. Why would they? The answer is the key to everything that's wrong with this movie : over inflated ego.

It is gargantuan ego that put Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, and others to sign up to this and not demand to be edited out after seeing the final depressing version. It is ego that makes Rebel Wilson think she can be the same character she is in everything else she's ever done and she will be funny (spoiler: she isn't). But even these graphic demonstrations of colossal self delusion pale in comparison to Hudson's hilarious performance.

To be by far the worst thing about the worst movie possibly ever made is in itself notable, but to quite obviously think you're by far the best thing in a profoundly important masterpiece is ego that mere mortals like you and I can only ponder on. Hudson viciously and sadistically tortures every note of Memory the way anyone with a musical bone in their body has always wanted to torture Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the only laugh out loud moment of the whole show, and believe me, I was not the only one in the cinema laughing.

What is interesting about all this though is that it makes us take a look at ourselves. We sometimes like to think of actors we've liked in various things as good folk who we'd enjoy having over to dinner, even though we've never met them. But what this movie shows is that our beloved thespians are in fact scrabbling back biters who would do anything for a feed yet think themselves superior to us and each other (and yet they all had so much trouble pretending to be cats...).

And that's the sad part. Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, we already knew about. But Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, Judy Dench - we see you now. And we won't forget. And nor, Ray Winstone, will the owners of Bet365. But do keep begging them to take you back. It's the only option you have left after this."
9.0,23 December 2019,"I went expecting it to be bad. But sometimes bad can be entertaining. This was just bad. There was no entertainment value in its badness. It's like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge. Many in the theater could not take it and left. Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves. Not much of an accomplishment. I found myself angry-angry at the people who made it, angry at the people who distributed it. It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment."
7.0,23 December 2019,"Before watching this movie, I was very happy with my mental state and life in general. I had a family, people who loved me as much as I loved them back. An amazing wife, 2 beautiful children and... I'm sorry but this is so hard to write... a cat. I thought despite the bad reviews and creepy previews that I could still find some joy in this movie as I have been able to find joy in many things in my life. However, I got ten minutes into the movie and my body wouldn't let me get up out of the chair, I was paralyzed as the horrible images, ear destroying songs, and dialogue that seemed to be written by a mentally challenged dodo bird was forced upon me. It has been several days since I left that theatre and I will not go into specific details, but my actions have lead to my family leaving me and my cat no longer being with us. Something has taken over my mind that I never though possible, there is such anger filling me that and I feel myself falling into a deep and dark hole with no chance of escape, even the thoughts of cats remind me of the horrors I faced in that movie theatre and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I fear that I will never be the same again, all I can hope is that my mind will repress the horrid memories that I have endured over the last couple days. I beg of anyone reading this... Do not watch this movie. Just leave a bad review and move on, trust me, it has ruined my life"
1.0,7 January 2021,"There has been an apocalypse. Mostly a cat-human hybrid seems to be thriving in the streets of London. They cultivate cockroaches for food and are obsessed with their own names as they sing and dance.

Sometimes their faces look weird somehow. It's not all the time. In fact, it's only once in awhile but I'm fixated with the problem. Their human faces don't always match their bodies. Even when it's done perfectly, it's inhuman. I'm going to say the obvious. The CGI is unnecessary. They are better off using make-up and wear leotards. If they're using CGI, I don't understand why they kept the boobs. They need to get rid of the human boobs. Leaving all that aside, I stopped caring about the story. I don't know the point of the story. It suffers the greatest sin of any story. It's boring. More than the weird cat-human hybrid or the dancing cockroaches or the horrible jokes, this is boring."

1.0,27 December 2019,"I don't understand why so many critics & audience members hated this movie so much. I don't typically like musicals but I actually liked this. The dancing & singing were great. I loved the 2 leads, Victoria & Munkustrap, who's faces & dancing were captivating to watch. Jennifer Hudson's singing made me cry, it was so well done. I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool & amazing. The only actor bit I didn't like was Taylor Swift. Yeech, she was bad. It was like she didn't even try to move like a cat. Don't know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense. The plot was actually very clear. The move kept me entertained."

Two weeks after release I sat in a sold out cinema with an entertained audience a lot of whom cried at appropriate moments. Yes it's weird, and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other, but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like. Not nearly as bad as people have been saying. The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes. You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and it's actually really impressive technically. It's fine."

3.0,20 December 2019,"Meowch! I've never seen the stage version of Cats, but this movie didn't do it any favors. The CGI feline humanoids are nightmare fuel-creeping, crawling, prancing & dancing though a paper-thin plot that drops the viewer in the middle of an unfamiliar & unsettling world without any real explanations. It's also full of (mostly) lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics. To put it simply, this film is litter-ally a cat-astrophe."
1.0,29 December 2019,"Honestly, if you are a true theater lover / dancer you can embrace this movie. I've been a fan of Cats since a small child (talking 4 years old) - and I have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. I felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. It had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production (thank you, Andrew Llyod Weber, executive producer and executive music director) with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. You get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. I loved the added dialogue to create the context - and loved the character choices of Idris Alba and the director Tom Hopper to bring Macavity more to life then in the original Broadway production. I felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well (thank you to Robbie Fairchild as Munkstrap - my fave cat!)- but an EXCEPTIONAL shout out to Jennifer Hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of Grizabella! (Memory made me cry) As far as CGI - if you can go to a Marvel movie and see Josh Brolin as Thanos and have no issue or see a ""youngified"" version of Michael Douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in CGI?? When I performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with Cat ears, loads of make-up and tails that swung around lifeless (while sometimes getting caught during the dancing) - at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive. So inconclusion, I could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but I leave with: if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you.

DANCERS: Les Twins are featured and the Jellical Ball is PHENOMENALLY executed.

2.0,20 December 2019,What the hell was that? How in the world could Hooper watch this and still release it? This goes way beyond weird; it's downright creepy at times which is magnified by all the bazillion closeups. That's not the way to watch this show. You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on. With a stellar cast such as this you'd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this. I'm sorry to say that that's pretty much what he did. I like Hooper. He's put out some really great stuff. This is not one of them.
1.0,4 May 2023,"I am a big fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's staged production of Cats. I got to see a local community stage production of Cats back in the early aughts. It was magical, transfixing and entertaining. Every bit as good as the Broadway production on the video that I own. I finally tracked down the 2019 version by the idiot Tom Hooper (I shall avoid all movies by this idiot forevermore). I have no issue with the set design, the actors, songs or dances. But rather the ridiculous, hideously creepy CGI he chose to do instead of traditional costume, hair and makeup. Seven minutes into watching the horrible mutation of cat on human body with a human face is just too nauseatingly disgusting to watch. The whole charm of the Webber stage production was the enchanting and magical makeup and costumes that transformed humans into cats. Hooper should be forced to watch his abomination over and over and over and over again for at least a year and then never ever allowed near a movie or tv or even theater stage ever again. The man should be blacklisted and should lose his equity card and shunned from Hollywood, Bollywood, Broadway, TV and if he ever shows up at a community theater he should be tarred and feathered and run out on the rail."
1.0,7 October 2023,"I rented it. I got exactly 30 minutes in and shut it off. I couldn't even finish it ironically. It is truly dreadful. This is proof that some media should stay where it was born and not be adapted for the screen. This review must contain six hundred words so I'll continue ranting about the crappy casting, atrocious CGI, ridiculous seriousness of all involved, behaving as if they are making a Masterpiece, instead of a disasterpiece. Also, it has that idiot James Corden. Why is he a thing? Why does he exist? If there is a God there is a devil, and if there is a Daniel Day-Lewis there must also be a James Corden!"
1.0,23 December 2019,"I never saw the Broadway show and did not know the story ahead of time. I already had my ticket before reading the reviews. I do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and I am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy. There was nothing sexual about it. The cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring. The costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking, especially the tails, but believe me, there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there, this was not one of them."
2.0,29 December 2019,"Yikes.

Before anyone tries to discredit me by saying I just don't ""get"" the point of the production, you should know that I have the official broadway recording the was released. I haven't ever been to a live show but I've seen the spectacular show on video time and time and TIME again. I'm aware that it's something to behold, an event devoid of any particularly defined plot or purpose. That's the charm of the performance, after all, right?

Well, yeah. But that doesn't translate to a film. A group of human beings in cheap costume with low-grade CGI prancing about without a purpose on a movie theatre screen doesn't work. It's not a performance of the broadway show; it's a feature film and in that venue it fails miserably. The talent that was employed for this production aren't showcasing their strongest efforts, the main name (Taylor Swift) was literally put in to sell tickets to the movie; her character ultimately does nothing for the film.

I really don't care that there's a ""new song"" or that there's a ""big budget"" put into this movie. All the money in the world can't take a concept that works good in one medium and make it into a good film. This performance belongs on the stage and on CD. As a film it's bland and it leaves nothing but a horribly vile taste in my mouth. This movie is a real hairball, no question about it. I wanted to chase these cats away with a spray bottle. I hope I never have to endure this torturous mess again."
8.0,25 December 2019,"First.. I knew nothing about the Broadway play, so I wasn't expecting much. I knew there were some big songs in the movie.. and I knew this had an excellent cast. But I went in not really expecting much. Wow! When you expect a lot, you're often disappointed. When you don't expect much, you're often very pleased. NOT in this case! The lead actress (Francesca Hayward) was truly excellent in the role (and her dancing was beautiful), and Swift, Dench, Wilson, McKellen, Hudson, and James Corden are some of the most incredible acting talent around (and Wilson & Corden comic excellence!!) But OMG.. this movie was terrible!!! Beautiful sets, scenes, and great dancing couldn't even begin to save the hideous story and plotless adventure. It was a total YAWN-fest of boredom! If you've ever had a nightmare that left you feeling nauseous, sick, and confused.. this movie is leaves you the same way!

I hate to be negative.. but this is not worth watching at all. I do want to acknowledge the production crew on excellent production values.. and Ms. Hayward for her beautiful movements.. but NOTHING (including talented actors) could have saved this train wreck!

7.0,3 January 2020,To all current and future high school band/theater students: Enjoy your mandatory viewing of this for years to come.
1.0,20 April 2020,"I must point out first that I have seen ""Cats"" on Broadway...and I was NOT a fan. I found the story bizarre and didn't particularly enjoy the play. So, consider this when you read the review.

As to the movie, it is one of the biggest disasters in recent box office memory, as the film was pretty much hated by everyone...including fans of the play. And, after seeing it, I can see why. Apart from a song here and there and the train dance number, pretty much everything about the film is terrible...especially its waste of talented and expensive stars. Many times, established stars are given songs that simply aren't good fits for their skills. The biggest example that comes to mind is Rebel Wilson....who I loved singing in other movies. Here, she just isn't that good...and it just goes to show you talented and likable stars are not going to work if the producers are out of their minds. A few other things I disliked about the film would include the creepiness of the characters, generally bad CGI (the opening scene shocked me how rotten it looked), Idris Elba looking naked (and super-creepy) towards the end of the film as well as the really creepy and awful cockroach scene.

The bottom line is that this film was a chore to finish....and I found myself asking my family if they really wanted to finish the movie! It lacks fun, quality and a sound reason for being made in the first place. This film simply needs to be put to sleep."
1.0,21 December 2019,"This film is based on the smash Broadway musical, and I thought it stayed fairly true to that show, as I remember it. So, going in knowing that, I enjoyed it. Lots of reviews saying there's no plot, not true! There IS a plot, albeit a very simple one. The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) at the annual Jellicle Ball. I will admit there were a couple of weird moments, like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cat's performance (played sweetly by Ian McKellen). But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the dancing, and the singing. Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up, I don't care who you are....... If you are a fan of the musical, you will probably like this movie. If you know nothing of the musical, you should probably acquaint yourself with it first, otherwise none of it will make sense, and you will think it's just weird. I liked it!!!"
1.0,21 December 2019,"I don't tend to write reviews, but felt it necessary on this one.

Firstly, other than knowing 2 songs, I knew nothing about the ""story"" for Cats. I soon realised, about 20 mins in, that there is no solid storyline, and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen. However, I loved it. The performances were amazing, I loved the dancing, and J Hud was outstanding, I was sobbing by the end. It's just one bizarre musical number after another.

Secondly, the CGI really isn't as awful as people are making it out to be. Some bits looked a little off, but it wasn't distracting at all. In fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. The set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating.

I can see why people may not like this movie, it's definitely not to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction. I think it's the lack of story that makes it hard to follow."

8.0,23 December 2019,"Bogus good reviews abound on this movie - all you have to do is check to see if the reviewer ever wrote a review before and then ask yourself why they would choose this to be their first amazing review. You have to assume the studio paid for those ones because they needed to have some good reviews.

This movie is peppered with stars, so you'd think it would be good. CGI has come so far, so you'd think that would be good too. But somehow it just added to how terrible this is.

The CGI is awful. The script is awful. Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful. The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI instead.

I have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow, this was a pile of poop.

Wait for it on Netflix for free, it's that bad. And there were only about 30 people in my showing and 4 of them left and never returned. That's how tragic this movie is, and it's a great musical on Broadway, just so NOT in this movie. It's a razzie contender for sure."

1.0,28 December 2019,"""Cats"" is a 2019 film based on the long lived 80's musical stage performance by the same name. It tells the story of a tribe of cats needing to decide yearly which one of them will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.

Alright so this happened, I saw ""Cats"" even after absolutely hating the trailer for this movie. I don't need to explain why I think the human-to-cat CGI is visually terrible looking, because it is. Yes the musical has strange visuals as well, but it works as a stage performance. Why? Because were expecting oddness, we know these performers are humans dressed as cats. The key word is ""dressed"", because I fully believe that this movie would've been a lot better if the team behind it just put them in costumes and prosthetic makeup like in the musical. It probably would've been SO MUCH CHEAPER too! I don't understand what the thought process was for this, other than to try and amaze audiences which backfired horribly. So were stuck with human faces and unproportioned lips that shift due to horrible MC, human hands and feet that levitate off the ground at moments and detached looking ears and tails. It's a mess.

Moving on past the CGI because I could go on all day, I will say the sets were semi-impressive considering they were actually built. Which again furthers my disbelief as to how they built actual sets but chose to CGI skin-tight catsuits onto actors, but I digress. The musical only takes place in a junkyard, so this movie expands upon the smaller feeling scale of its source material which is nice. Also the story is quite loyal to the musical, and yes there is a story. Could Tom Hooper have stretched out the story to be more suitable to audiences? Yes, but it wouldn't of been ""Cats"" then. The musical is literally a character study, going through each cat (kind of like an initiation ceremony or talent competition) so we the audience get to know them through personalized song, rather than have Munkustrap (our main narrator) describe absolutely everything. It's interesting and each of the cats does have its own personality, we also get to see the smaller plot of which cat gets to be the ""chosen one"" and be reborn into a new life.

This kind of loose plot doesn't really work in a film, which is why noone asked for this to be made. I still don't know who was the intended demographic for this film, other than fans of the musical I guess? The casting is well done (for the most part) ,however some actors were clearly cast just to pull in more viewers and not for talent or appropriateness. Rebel Wilson was awful, very unfunny and didn't embody Jennyanydots's character at all, whom is weird and quirky. James Corden was pretty bad too as Bustopher Jones, though not quite as bad as Rebel Wilson. He presented the character more on point at least. The last bad fruit in the basket of the cast in my opinion will probably offend many. I couldn't stand Taylor Swift's Bombalurina performance in this. First of all, she's shown in the trailer quite a lot because she's a huge selling point, but is barely in the film (one song's worth and doesn't even return at the end). Secondly, her song sounded terrible and I think it was the worst in the film tieing with Rebel Wilson's. I couldn't tell if she was trying to impersonate a british accent while singing, or if her tone was just all over the place? Maybe both! Lastly, her CGI looked the worst to me out of anybodys. So that just pushed the illusion the film was trying to create further out the window.

Everyone else either did alright or surprisingly better than I expected. Newcomer Francesca Hayward did very well and I feel awful that this is her introduction into film. Jennifer Hudson killed it as Grizabella, though I wish she would've had more screen time and they changed her approach to Victoria. In the musical she's desperately trying to have someone touch her in order to be taken back into the tribe, but in this that moment doesn't happen. Which bugged me more than it probably should have. Idris Elba did well as villain Macavity and Jason Derulo was okay, he just didn't stand a chance against the live actor though in the 80's musical film. My favorite character portrayal was Mr. Mistoffelees though, Laurie Davidson did really well and I hope to see him in more! Everyone else was kind of just alright in my opinion, they either didn't bring enough character to the roll or I just didn't really care for them to begin with. The music was faithful and for the most part sounded good so oh well, though the newly added song I didn't care for because it stuck out like a sore thumb.

Honestly, if you want a true showing of ""Cats"" just watch the 80's musical movie adaptation. It's pretty good and close-up so you can see all of the details put into the performances. This movie will probably garner some kind of following, I've already seen fanfiction drawings of Victoria and Mistoffelees. Which probably resulted from this movie surfacing and pushing that ""romance"" more into the light, but it doesn't really bother me. Tom Hooper has definitely become of those directors that either makes massively successful films that acquire acclaim or real failures that people hate. Which is fascinating. If you have a morbid fascination with this film, go see it! If not don't force yourself to, you'll want to leave and regret spending money on an overpriced theatre ticket."

The most disturbing thing for me is how obvious the green screen is. I can't stop starring at their feet. They didn't even try to make it look a little real. No depth of fiel, nothing. This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnatural.

Some songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad. I wanted to leave after 20min but my mom paid for the tickets and I don't want to be disrespectful.

I don't think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen. Because of all the reasons above but I also think it's just too theatrical and just doesn't adapt well. I have no doubt this would be 10x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stage.

Stay away from this movie."

8.0,12 January 2020,"Sometimes in life we all ignore that quiet still small voice inside us, that voice with wise judgement urging us to make the right decision, sadly for me I recently ignored this inner voice and my want to see what has been called one of the most downright bad film's of all time is a case of curiosity almost killing the (Eddie) cat.

I, like many others had no great desire to see the cinematic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical Cats, especially after witnessing the close to frightening trailers, that for some reason decided to mould felines and humans into some form of monstrously designed evil hybrid but after all the press proclaiming the depths of despair this film sinks to, I felt it was my duty too catch it first hand.

What I and other viewers are greeted with is a film so lifeless and devoid of any form of spark, that it's nigh on incomprehensible that not only Oscar nominated director Tom Hooper is the man responsible for this crime against film but that he managed to secure 100's of million in cash to make it and recruit an A-list cast to partake in its follies.

How any sane person could read the Cats script and think it was going to turn out in a reasonable way is beyond me, as Hopper and his writing team lead this almost entirely song and dance experience through a plot that doesn't even pretend to have a story.

There's certainly visions I will never forget, that much I can give the film, images such as James Corden lapping up delicious treats with his cat tongue, Sir Ian McKellan meowing seductively to the camera, Jennifer Hudson's runny nose and Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches are but some glories but trying to figure out what is happening in this jellicle madness is not worth the brain power.

After a seemingly never ending opening song and dance number that almost sends you off the deep end before the shows even really begun, the tale of Francesca Hayward's abandoned cat Victoria and her night out on the town being introduced to all manner of fluffy friends is two hours of pure tedium and pain as we begin to not only question the films existence, but that of life itself.

The whole experience is supposed to be a fun and colorful trip to an extra ordinary feline world but despite some undeniably great costumes and set design, this family rated feature is akin to some type of Lovecraftian horror trip as we traverse graveyards, milk clubs and back alleys on our quest to find out who indeed from these cats is the most jellicle.

Towards the end of Hopper's disasterpiece, Dame Judi Dench's cat matriarch Deuteronomy stares directly at the audience and proclaims about what we have all learnt throughout the last few hours, it's a bizarre ploy, a scary and uncomfortable ending to a film that needs to be seen to be believed but one that I beg you not to ever watch, let that curiosity go and don't make the same mistakes I did.

Final Say -

Cats is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before and I trust we will never see again.

A plot-less, painful and embarrassingly bad big budget extravaganza that will live long in echelons of epic Hollywood failures.

1.0,18 April 2020,No this wasn't Broadway. Nothing can outdo that. This was a movie projection of the Broadway play with a complete set. Broadway is like reading a book and it becoming your imagination of what the set looked like. This is how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the set. The main character is a ballet dancer in London. And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London. I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills. You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age. WOW! Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent. Her singing is so soulful. Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it very much but you have to go in watching it as a movie not a broadway play. Two very different things.

1.0,31 December 2019,"Although I am a big Broadway musical fan and have heard the soundtrack of Cats many times, I never knew the full plot. It was nice to go into the movie being familiar with the songs. Since I was familiar with the songs, I did note that some songs were not what they could of been, but overall they were very entertaining and even moving. During one song, I started off a little disappointed, but by the end of the song, enjoyed it very much. At a few points near the end, I got emotional and had chills. The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it. If you enjoy musicals, dance numbers, and Broadway-style solos, the movie is worth your time. It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends. Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing. Quite a few ""new"" actors who did a wonderful job as well. Excited to see where they go in the future."
3.0,21 December 2019,Can't even explain how bad this movie is... so here's an emoji of a sad cat. 😿
1.0,20 December 2019,"Cats is way out of my comfort zone: I'm not a fan of West End musicals, I can't stand James Corden (and struggle with Rebel Wilson), and the idea of Judi Dench singing is the stuff of nightmares. However, the lure of seeing something truly terrible and then being able to write a scathing review proved too irresistible; to that end, I wasn't disappointed (plus, the viewing was free for me: I won an Unlimited cinema pass earlier in the year).

Imagine all of the roller-skating locomotives of Starlight Express speeding down their ramps and flying off the stage in unison, landing in a crumpled heap in the front row, arms and legs twisted and broken: Cats is an even bigger train wreck than that. Putting aside the frankly bizarre sight of well-known performers with CG cat ears, fur and tails, the film is still 100 minutes of 'what were they thinking?' with a sprinkling of 'who the hell likes this stuff?'.

A nonsensical plot (based on T.S. Eliot's 1939 anthology, Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats) strings together the baffling musical numbers, of which there are many. The word 'jellicle' gets said an awful lot, but no-one explains what it means. It's not unlike a wild fever dream, with bizarre imagery, strange performances and lacklustre song and dance routines pummelling the senses until the final act, in which Jennifer Hudson's snivelling, runny-nosed Grizabella screeches her rendition of Memory (more painful than a cat making itself comfy on your lap) before disappearing into the sky in a chandelier suspended from a hot air balloon.

James Corden is as unbearably irritating as I had imagined and watching Rebel Wilson effectively naked except for a layer of fur is hard to take. On the flipside, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina is hot despite her all-over hair, and easily the highlight of the whole sorry mess.

2/10 for Taylor Swift, but I almost deducted a point for the mice and cockroaches. Human-like felines are a stretch; anthropomorphic rodents and insects are a step too far."
1.0,29 May 2023,"This ain't a kids movie. When you think of cats, you think, ""Medium sized animals with whiskers that stand on 4 paws."" Whelp.. this movie, however, does not fit with that description. More like, ""freaky looking humans with tails and plastic surgery to look like cats."" Nightmares. It. Gave. Me. Nightmares. I closed my eyes while watching it at the theatre. Hideous. Absolutely hideous. I'm not a big fan of musicals, but this one was by all means the WORST. It's not fun watching humans that make themselves look like cats. I swear this musical was making fun of cats. I recommend for this movie to make an apologetic letter to the cats of the world.

I've never met a person who liked this horror. I love cats, I have three, but, please, stop offending them like this! Cats don't deserve this! -ps: cats don't belong on two legs. -peace out. -Ralphie Walters."
1.0,21 December 2019,"Eek it was ok. Is prob the best review i can say. Whats the point of taking a stage show and making a blockbuster movie that looks like a stage show. Every scene looks like a cardboard or cgi backdrop. So its hard to buy-in to the feline world. It all looks fake. Its all so dull And feels like a three hour movie rather than a two hour movie. Nothing really happens. laurie Davidson & Francesca Hayward shine out though despite all the high profile cast. Francesca as a cat is strangely arousing. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella has a house raising moment. But Mckellan, Dench,Derulo, Elba, Winstone are all wasted here in un-memorable parts in a to be honest un-memorable movie. To be frank, It needed Sir Tim Rice (as do all Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber productions) 3/10"
1.0,11 March 2023,"Unironically probably the worst film I've seen with such a high budget, good cast and talented director. Les miserables, the Kings speech, then CATS??? Embarrassing trainwreck of a film. The cast on paper is promising also, with stars like Judi Dench, Taylor swift, Ian McKellen, idris Elba, etc all wasted on this nightmarish fever dream. If the songs were at least somewhat good perhaps this film could be bearable blindfolded but the songs just sound horrible, the auto tune and disgustingly animated choreography makes for an unpleasant viewing experience each time a new song starts. I'm sad Idris Elba couldn't have succeeded and killed every single one of them."

1.0,9 July 2023,"I am amazed that music talents like Taylor and Jennifer would sink this low in their carears as to join in with a complete tone-deaf cast of misc actors, just to be in a ""musical"" on screen?

Doint the same roles at Broadway would have been much more logical and carear smart (imho).

But if you like to watch a vulgar Rebel spread her legs wide and lick her tail, you will get your fetishes all fullfilled.

It is more painfull to watch the CGI effects in this movie, than even rewatch old episodes of Star Trek from the 80s or 90s.

It is a compliment to give this film a 1 star ranking, but 0 is not possible to give."
2.0,21 December 2019,"We loved the broadway musical so decided to see CATS the movie. We saw the reviews and went in with low expectation. Guess what, we enjoyed it. People say they liked the musical but not the movie due to the music. It was the same music except for 1 new song and the music for one song changed but the words were the same. I didn't want it to end and wished they had added a few more songs. The visuals were amazing and I loved the little mice. Also glad that they made Victoria the new cat to explain what was happing which I had to do for the broadway musical. Yes it was different but it was suppose to be."
1.0,20 December 2019,"I actually thought I was under the influence of some kinds for the first few minutes but once the weirdness subsided I actually enjoyed this. I saw Cats on stage when i was younger and have always loved the characters and songs so for me it was good fun and self indulgent. Just take it for what it is, relax and enjoy"
1.0,2 February 2024,"Presumably at some point a group of people in a room sat down and watched this movie and decided it was ready to be seen by the general public, and that fact boggles the mind.

I realize they couldn't have had any of these cats be anatomically correct if they were going to keep this movie from being kitty porn, but somehow the fact that none of the cats have genitalia is actually more obscene.

Why do some of the cats get clothes but others run around naked? And why do they have human hands and feet? They all look like lab experiments.

Someone needs to tell Jennifer Hudson she doesn't need to try so hard. She's putting way more effort into this movie than it deserves. And they also need to wipe her nose.

Judi Dench has been nominated for eight....8!.....Academy Awards. Let that fact sink in for a bit.

Ian McKellen, bless your heart, you almost make your scenes work. Almost.

Idris Elba, you are the stuff of my nightmares.

I don't get the scale in this movie. Sometimes the cats look like normal human size, but then they'll be dwarfed by something like a a dinner plate and then I'm like, wait, either that cat is really small or that dinner plate is really large.

Having human heads on tiny little mouse bodies was a terrible idea. Actually, this whole movie was a terrible idea.

The thing is, I actually like the music to the Broadway show, but this movie makes even the music sound bad.

I'll stick to dogs.

Grade: F."
1.0,23 December 2019,Well.... it was painfully long for such a short movie. The numbers were good. Taylor Swift was great as was Rebel Wilson. It just needed maybe some more excitement or substance or something. It just didn't move quick enough for me to enjoy it. I kept wondering when and wishing for it to be over. The acting was great. This was all down to the script and editing.
4.0,1 January 2020,I don't know why this movie was ever made and I don't know who the movie was made for. Because the jokes are so stupid I don't think kids would laugh at it. Just don't bother.

1.0,3 July 2021,
8.0,20 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tom Hooper must really enjoy this process. In 2012 he brought mega-hit stage musical LES MISERABLES to the screen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 3, including one for Anne Hathaway. This time, Mr. Hooper again turns his talents towards a colossally successful stage musical, and costumes, make-up, and visual effects are even more crucial. Whereas Les Mis was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel, CATS was adapted by songwriter Andrew Lloyd Webber from a 1939 poetry collection of T.S. Elilot. Of course, Mr. Webber is also the genius behind other brilliant musicals, including THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (from the novel by Gaston Leroux).

Tom Hooper and Lee Hall have adapted the screenplay from the stage presentation, and the sung-through musical approach means there is minimal dialogue. Songs are used to tell the story and introduce the key characters. Choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (a 3-time Tony winner, ""Hamilton"") is the real star. Multiple dance styles are featured, including: classical ballet, contemporary, hip-hop, and traditional tap. The dancing is tremendous, and of course, a big part of that is Francesca Hayward, who plays new kitten on the block, Victoria. Ms. Hayward is a Principal Ballerina at The Royal Ballet. Numerous other skilled dancers are in the cast as well.

The story (such that it is) revolves around a tribe of Jellicle cats who have an annual ritual of selecting one to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back with a new Jellicle life. Sweet Victoria is unceremoniously dumped in the alley by her owner, and is quickly surrounded by this tribe of cats that basically aren't very nice. It's in this opening sequence where we realize these humans as cats actually look a bit creepy and take a while to get accustomed to. Given the structure, the story plods along through each successive song, with certain characters getting their moment to shine. These include Rebel Wilson as humorous and chunky Gumbie cat Jennyanydots, Rum Tum Tiger cat played by talented musician/singer/dancer Jason Derulo, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as outcast Grizabella, James Corden as the usually-hungry Bustopher Jones, and Oscar winner Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. Always hovering, is the mystical Macavity played by glowing-green-eyed Idris Elba, and making a later appearance is Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, singing the Macavity tribute song.

The two most memorable numbers come courtesy of Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat, and Ms. Hudson who belts out the most famous song of the production, ""Memory"", in a vocal and emotional highlight of the film. Visually, it's Mr. Mistofelees (Laurie Davidson) magic number that breaks us out of the muted palette. The other musical numbers mostly just fall flat and aren't very entertaining or enjoyable.

It's pure coincidence that the screening for this film was the same day as the new Star Wars movie. The franchise for the latter began in 1977, while ""Cats"" first hit the stage in 1981. That's quite a legacy for both. As for this film version from director Hooper, I do wonder if enough viewers will respond to a musical where the story and songs are overshadowed by the dancing, and the sets and costumes offer no 'wow' factor. Many will find these characters hard to connect with ... at least outside of that incredible Jennifer Hudson vocal. It seems these kitties should have remained on stage."
7.0,1 May 2022,"It was Christmas, hanging out with the family, all of a sudden the trailer for the Cats movie came on, and everyone stops talking and watched the trailer (which was actually pretty epic) and then at the end of the preview, my Grandma said, ""that looks terrible"", and I just burst out laughing."
1.0,28 December 2019,"Horrible CGI , terrible performances by actors , weak storyline , total waste of money and time."
2.0,27 December 2019,"I am not a cat lover, but i love musical theater. In 1984, when Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cats opened in Washington, DC's National Theater, i went to see it for the first time not knowing what to expect. I was blown away by the music, the staging, the concept. Over the years, i went to see the musical on stage three more times. And i couldn't wait to see a big-screen version that can be enjoyed by one and all, and not just those who can afford theater tickets. Finally, my dream has been fulfilled and i can die in peace. Cats the movie is pretty much what i imagined the musical on celluloid would be, with its near-purrfect casting and excellent choreography. While everyone was good in their own way, some impressed more than others. My favorite number and performer is probably Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat featuring Steven McRae followed by Mr Mistoffelees with Laurie Davidson and original song Beautiful Ghosts sung by newcomer Francesca Hayward. Also delightful with their turns were James Cordern as Bustopher Jones, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger. A lovely surprise was Taylor Swift who wowed as Bombalurina, proving her early doubters wrong that she could carry off that role. The part of Old Deuteronomy, played by male actors in the stage versions, was given to Dame Judi Dench; she who became the first female M in the Bond franchise also did justice to this dignified role. Haters who decided not to like or love this movie before or after viewing it will find any reason or excuse to hate it. As for me, watching this Cats on the big screen left me ""feline good""."
1.0,7 February 2021,"I wasn't expecting much. I have never seen the musical. I have heard the song Memories, but that's it. All of that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Jennifer Hudson was incredible! The other stars were almost as memorizing for me - although keep in mind, I am someone who used to dance, and could watch hours of ballet without boredom. Well done!"
1.0,20 December 2019,"This is the worst film I have seen in a long time.

9.0,24 December 2019,"It's hard to believe a movie can be THIS bad with a 100 million dollar budget. There's a lot to complain about, but the worst part of all was the written-in song that stuck out like a sore thumb.. I wish I could forget."
7.0,20 December 2019,"They spent a whopping $95M on this crap. Tuneless musical based on a Broadway show and starring computer generated fur stuck around the faces and bodies of some actors singing too loudly. The original choreography was dumped in favor of what the CGI could produce.

The major critics have all lambasted this bomb and the awards season has pretty much ignored it. Even Judi Dench couldn't squeeze a good mention out of any of them.

Critics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry. Even the close-ups of singers, faces framed in CGI fur, go all wonky if they move. It's like a series of auditions in close-up or even worse, cat night at your local karaoke bar.

Most of the actors are (blessedly) unrecognizable but Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, James Corden, Taylor Swift, and Ray Winstone are all in this back-ally mess."
1.0,23 December 2019,Just awful and the blame falls squarely on the Script and Director. Except for Ian McKellen there was absolutely no interest or connection between audience and characters. The movie had no heart and there was no reason for us to like the characters. The poor actors had to work with bad choice after bad choice. The studio shouldn't throw any more money at this flop to fix the GCI. That's not the problem.
1.0,27 February 2021,"I cannot even comprehend all the negative reviews! The animatronics are great, and the singing and acting are pretty good. C'mon, we pretty much all know the story and what to expect. THiS IS CUTE.

If you've seen the actual musical (or several times, like I have...) then this is a pretty good representation."
1.0,29 December 2020,"It's Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats - what did y'all think you were going to see? It's a strange musical, with a strange premise, with strange characters - why would the movie be any different? It was true to form. The musical numbers are fun and dramatic. The cats look weird, but that's to be expected, considering it's a bunch of adult actors playing cats. Enjoy the music and bizarreness of it all - it's kind of fun! Additionally, Jennifer Hudson is phenomenal! She didn't have to go that hard, but she did, and we should be grateful!"

After about 15 minutes, I couldn't hear the movie over the crying, yelling and one guy was even howling. Three older ladies beside me took out lighters and lite themselves on fire. They just kept screaming, ""We're free, we're free."" We all stormed to the front counter to get our money back. Ans what do you know, they just had cardboard cut outs of CATS sitting up front. They were just toying with us. So we did what any logical person would do, we went out side and started punching cats."
1.0,7 February 2020,"The Emoji Movie, was... a terrible movie. But Cats takes the cake for the worst movie of all time. Like, if we compare them both together, The Emoji Movie is a million times better. The Emoji Movie, while obviously a big waste of time, at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting, for the most part. It also didn't make my eyes bleed from the CGI. Cats, on the other hand has no redeeming qualities. Trash music and story, as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel ""cat people""."
9.0,27 December 2019,"I just went to see the film adaption of Cats - I think it has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.

The film itself was largely devoid of storyline and frankly quite boring. The visuals were nice but overall it was gaudy. The choreography was OK but the vocal performances were questionable.

The CGI and the movements of the actors was interesting but only for a few minutes. The way the cats moved varied throughout the film (walking on two feet or four feet) and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props & scenery.

All of the sung parts seemed to be recorded 'dry', without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene, which really spoiled the realism for me. Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth, two inches from the microphone.

Several people walked out of the cinema halfway through, and I don't blame them. I stayed until the end in case it got better, but it didn't."
7.0,20 December 2019,"Tom Hopper has become the most snobbish filmmaker with an Oscar... He now makes films that sound like people pleasers and sure things when the cinema is about emotion and guts. Don't adapt Broadway musicals, read André Bazin or take a page from Damien Chizelle's book. This remake tendencies that we are seeing suck, if you really have something to say or do with an adaptation do it, but don't rip it off and prentend we'll enjoy it like the real thing, not even if you cast Taylor Swift or Jason Derulo... p.s. BS"

5.0,26 December 2019,"I don't know who these people are that think this is a ""terrible"" movie or garbage. If you don't ""get"" Cats then maybe I could see some people not enjoying it. HOWEVER, having said that, I loved it. The producers didn't stray too far from the original musical production. I was afraid they would try and rewrite it to make it more commercially palatable. I LOVE the CGI fur and ears on the actors. You can see they tried very hard to mimic cat movements. The actors are actually able to sing their character parts. They didn't just throw a well known actor in and hope they could sing. Rebel Wilson sounds like a perfect Jennyanydots - waver in the voice and all. Munkustrap (who narrates the majority of the show) has a very clear tone and can carry any part he needs to. I was happy they didn't try and shove TayTay at all of us - she has a very small part all things considered. Francesca Heyward is lovely as Victoria. Her dancing skills show off the power AND grace needed to carry the main character. Jennifer Hudson's version of Memory is mature and moving. Memory is notoriously difficult to sing and singing it well is just that much harder. All in all this version gives a bit more ""story"" to the musical. You get to see Victoria's interest in Grizabella and her compassion for Miss Griz. Dame Judy is brilliant as always even though she cannot sing as strongly as the rest of the cast. Since she plays the sage older Deuteronomy it makes sense. This should be up for best special effects or costuming. The ears especially give so much expression to each cat. If you have seen the Broadway version you will understand why sticking close to the source material is important. Each cat contributes to the flow of the story - even the chorus cats. Most of them have actual names (Bomburlina, Coricopat, Syllabub). In the penultimate action Mr. Mistoffelees is adorable and you can see the confidence build. He is much more shy in the movie than the stage production but it works really well in the growth of his relationship to Victoria."
1.0,21 December 2019,"I guess haters gotta hate. It took a few minutes to get used the cgi fur and odd physical movements but I was surprised that I liked the movie. It made no sense in any rational world but it was fun to watch. The Dancing was lovely, Judy Dench can save any movie and she and Ian McKellan certainly brought the needed grounding this movie needed. James cordon and rebel wilson were great as well as were the lesser known main characters. Overall, better than the screen adaptation of Phantom."
1.0,31 December 2019,No. Just no. This is the worst movie of all time. It's awful. Don't watch it.
1.0,23 December 2019,"Honestly,I went into this hoping for a train-wreck. I saw the reviews,and laughed. But this was not what I expected. Cats 2019 feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play, but the computer focused too much on face recognition. The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical, no modern hip hop remixes here. All the main cats get their own songs,and they may just be only introducing themselves and that's it,but they're all done well, and I enjoyed some of it a lot, especially the opening number. 'Memories' actually brought me to tears,something that doesn't happen very often. The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI, which,yes,does look freakish at first,but by the last third, I didn't care. This isn't the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for, but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars, there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office."

The CGI cats are awful looking and you can't help but shake your head at all of the big names in this box of a movie. I hope they got paid big bucks for this disaster. Save your money and go listen to the soundtrack if you are into this kind of thing. We ended up going to see the new Star Wars movie. If I could have given it zero star I would.

I have given Cats one star due to a scene that literally made me feel nauseous (fat cat eating cockroaches).

Post WWII audio/visual torture techniques were developed. They were designed to induce nausea. I truly believe, by pure chance, Cats has happened upon some of these - It should genuinely be looked into. In many of the Cats reviews people use phrases like 'fever dream' & 'bad trip' & I believe it's no coincidence."
2.0,31 December 2019,Not worth your time or money. This was completely boring the entire time and is only interesting in its appalling imagery. My friends and I saw it just to make fun of it and it wasn't even fun to do that. Hopefully this movie is forgotten forever.
1.0,15 April 2021,"Not at all as bad as the critics said. Sure it's not like watching the musical but the singing and dancing is very good. The characters are a bit one dimensional but they are from a book of poems for goodness sake. Judy dench has her lovely screen presence in it. It's a perfectly watchable translation from the film, given a bit more explanation than the stage play. I prefer the mungo Jerry number in this to the musical. In short. Watch with an open mind and not based on what the critics say."
1.0,22 December 2019,"I wasn't planning to see CATS today, but the theater I went to played CATS instead of the movie I played to see. I did not see a Broadway production of CATS, but I have seen it performed live in my area and did not care for it at all. Today I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the characters of Mr. Mistoffelees and Victoria. I thought Rebel Wilson's cat was very well done. For the first time ever I got the sense that there was a story, and I was able to follow it. I'm glad I saw it and hope lots of cat lovers get out to see it."
1.0,26 January 2020,"Actually, I wanted to give it 1 and a half but the feedback won't let me so I rounded it up to 2 instead of down to 1 on the strength of Taylor Swift being in it. (The other one was for the brilliant Rebel Wilson, the only joy in the movie) So, why did it bomb and why did I rate it so low? Easy...it's a dire film. The music is appalling and there's nothing at all to sing along to and no catchy tunes whatsoever. That's a big fail for a musical. The 'lyrics are boring and uninspiring and tbh half the time I could not make them out anyway. The acting is appalling. I honestly thought Francesca Hayward's 'character' had a rigid face for the first half hour as hers never changed. You can tell she's a ballerina but her posh poses had no place as a cat. She should have been taught to dumb down her posing. The CGI wasn't very good. The sets all looked as if they were going to be great but had not yet been finished off. The very human faces were too human, they were human faces on cats' bodies, bizarre. They should have cat-ised the faces so that they suited the bodies. And boobs on cats??? Rebel is a big lass, they should have dealt with her breasts in CGI to make them more cat like. Finally, the story was crap. It was long and drawn out at the start and then amounted to nothing. I admit I didn't watch the final part (maybe 20 mins or so) I honestly just couldn't bare it any longer. Conclusion: Everyone should watch this movie just to see how bad movies can actually get."

1.0,21 December 2019,"I think this film is overrated, I had high hopes going to see this film because the musical was good but it isn't good when you have the entire movie just singing about cats!! I didn't even understand what a jellical cat was and I found it really annoying.

There's no plot to it and I wish it had some kind of backstory or at least some drama but it was terrible. I was bored out of my seat and waited for it to finish. It was so boring. They wouldn't stop screeching their voices.

It's like that film you watch and you forget about for years like some nightmare"
1.0,20 December 2019,"Reading the slating it gets on here makes me think that all the 1 stars reviewers have never seen the Cats before. It's always been a 'marmite' production but for true theatre lovers, it's an epic representation of T.S Eliot's poems. The film brought more of a storyline to the show and the additional song slipped in nicely. Personally I found Jason Derulo disappointing and although Judy Dench was good in her role, I would have cast Brian Blessed as a nod to the original west end production, of nothing else than his wonderful performance of The Ad-dressing of Cats. I'd say don't listen to the haters, give it a go with an open mind, you just might love it, if so then you live the theatre production even more!"

1.0,24 December 2019,I watch bad movies as a hobby and this is among the worst movies I've ever seen. There is literally no story. People were walking out. Tom Hooper is the name Alan smithee uses when even he's embarrassed to put a name on his picture. One of the worst movies of the decade. 90 million dollars for that? Imagine how many poor children you could feed?
1.0,12 January 2020,Tbh i would rather burn my money than watch this movie. I never expected to see anything worse than the live action aladdin or worse than the old live action sonic film but here it is... nightmare fuel.

9.0,21 December 2019,Me and my boyfriend went to see Cats whole heartedly ready to enjoy it. Cats was a mistake. It is an affront to the people who created it. We walked out just over an hour into the film. People aren't exaggerating about how bad it is. It's THAT bad

1.0,24 December 2019,"This is absolutely stunning. This movie shows how far movie makers can go wrong. i'm literally astonished. couldn't believe this movie is real until the end.

hats off to Tom Hooper so I can throw the hat at him"
2.0,27 March 2020,"Wow. Now I understand why people sometimes give 1/10 to movies. Like what was that? It was so unnecessary,uncomfortable and lame. I couldn't even understand plot. Every cat singing about being cat? It supposed to be something that would catch audience in 2019-2020? Also comedy genre? Is this for seriously? It was so bad. Now I will have nightmares after watching this."
1.0,25 January 2020,"My 8 year old daughter threw up 3 minutes in to this movie. I cleaned up the theater floor and she wanted to stay to see the rest. Honestly, the movie was just as bad as seeing it performed live but at least it was only $6 for 2 people instead of $150/ticket."
1.0,28 December 2019,"""Cats"" is such a strange film. If it had taken a much, much simpler, stripped-down approach, it could have been charming and sweet. Talk about gilding the lily: the filmmakers chose to pile on the CGI, and along with it a lot of unnecessary dialog and additional ""plot"" to this paper-thin musical. The Broadway show is a silly string of funny songs with one poignant ballad thrown in; the movie strains to add an actual storyline for no particular reason.

To be fair, some of the performances are just fine, particularly Francesca Hayward, who does a marvelous job with her songs and is wonderful to behold in her dance scenes. Those bright spots are few, though, with truly awful, broad, unfunny vaudeville from Rebel Wilson and James Corden. Wow, are they bad. They act like friends watching the movie will be impressed, as if they're in a high school play and need to ham it up. Will Rebel Wilson ever star in a role that doesn't feature her constantly hurting herself, doing pratfalls and smacking herself in the face?

A scroll through this IMDB page shows you just how many people were involved with the creation of this film. How much money and effort could've been saved here, just approaching the light, cute source material with simplicity."

6.0,24 December 2019,"I don't normally walk out of movies but this I had to, it's very confusing and the storyline is not clear what so ever. I understand it's a musical but it's song after song and the dialogue is very minor. The CGI is weird looking and I just couldn't watch the whole thing. I had hopes for this movie but it really wasn't very good."

1.0,23 December 2019,"I went into this blind. I really liked it. They did pretty good with the effects. I liked the tails and ears. Jennifer Hudson, Judi D and the Magic cat guy and the cat who played Victoria and the other main cat guy LOL I cant remember but I loved the whole cast. Idris was just okay. I am surprised ppl are giving such negative reviews. JHud needs an award! I want to go see the broadway play now. With all that being said I still like dogs better😉"
1.0,28 December 2019,"I have to preface this that I never saw the Broadway musical or previous movie. I had no idea what the story line was. I was just expecting a musical about cats. So why the horrific reviews? I don't always love musicals. The songs in these were somewhat weird; I only knew of the song ""Memories"". But I thought Francesca Hayward was cute and very watchable, as well as Laurie Davidson and Robbie Fairchild. Loved the dancing and the sets. We go to movies to either learn something and/or be entertained. Did I learn anything? No, but now I know what Cats is about. Would I see it again? No. Was it terrible? No! The dancing, the sets, the cat ""acting"" and the weird story line - it was entertaining and visually impressive."

1.0,23 December 2019,"I thought can a film possibly be as bad as what people were saying..... the answer is yes..... this film is absolutely dire in every sense. The cgi human cats are disturbing. The deep sense of embarrassment for the A-listers, and James Cordon was the cherry on top."

Between the border line weirdos in the audience claiming to be ""furries"" this should be rated nc-17 just for that. How many neutered crotch shots can we see in one film? ...sorry cats but you are for the dogs!"
1.0,21 December 2019,Awful adaptation of a classic musical. Shame really.. could of been amazing
1.0,23 December 2019,"No no no and no, I was unlucky enough to be dragged along to a pre screening of this absolute drivel. I can't find anything redeeming about this film. It's cringy beyond cringy. Don't do it. You will waste nearly 2 hours of your life if you go to watch this that you can never get back and you might be mentally scarred for life. It is really that grim."
2.0,22 December 2019,"I don't really get the poor reviews that I've seen, I wonder if it's to do with expectations; did they not realise that the film is sticking as close to Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's staging and costuming as the director felt fit. I didn't really mind the CGI of the actors' faces, maybe it was thought that something like that would be demanded from today's audiences. or was it just that Taylor Swift and Idris Elba couldn't dance? But for me it was a minor thing and didn't interfere with my enjoyment at all. There were only 2 things that I'd have changed: someone should have got Jennifer Hudson some better crying eye drops, as her runny nose was off-putting, and Idris Elba as Macavity's fur could have done with being a tad longer as Idris Elba looked as if he had no clothes on, but no bits as it were 🙀. I would absolutely recommend this for Cats fans, if you're not familiar with the show then a little research will help enormously."
1.0,21 December 2019,"This was just what I needed just before Christmas. The perfect escape from stress. Me and my partner went to see it, I'm a huge musical fan. He isn't but we both enjoyed it. Yes it has its flaws. I couldn't get my head around the fact they had human hands and some had shoes on. But if you have enough imagination it is fantastic and the dancing is just brilliant to watch. The stars were definitely Jason Derulo and Jenifer Hudson who made me cry with her wonderful voice."

1.0,20 December 2019,"If you like the Broadway show, you will likely enjoy this movie. The Broadway show is a string of catchy songs, with some dancing, and very little plot. This is no different. Don't expect a story. Expect to be entertained. The movie builds on the Broadway show and does what is meant to do: entertain. Don't expect oscar winning plot lines. Critics need to be aware of what the movie is working with before they hammer it. The movie is well done. It exceeded my expectations."
4.0,21 December 2019,"I saw cats last night. Most likely am going to see it again sometime this weekend. Critics are so full of crap its not even funny. First off the sexual comments that every critic seems to be saying. What does it say when critics are finding something to be sexualized more then furries? There was a kitchen scene was god damn nuts. I was uncomfortable with some of those camera angles on Rebel Wilson and some of the implied self thigh rubbing....*coughs* Yeah well. And the less said about the mice and cockroaches the better.

But beyond that umm no. They are cats + ballet + musical. I'm getting the impression that folks who went to see this film to review it have never seen a ballet or stage musical before. Just because you grab someone by the waist or are in close quarters with them doesn't equate to sexual.

I think critics are confused because this is where the term anthropomorphic comes into play. You have people who look like cats who are acting like cats and it's causing problems with ""reading"" the body language of the people in the movie. This is all on the director and choreographer.

A lot of the reviews are saying the CGI is bad. Umm no. Not at all. The fur is perfect. The complains about some of the actors wearing fur vs some are just naked. First I saw someone complaining about being neutered. Do you really want to see anatomically correct cats in this movie? Are you sure you aren't a closet furry or something? The choice to go with characters wearing outfits and some not.....look at who is dancing. The folks who do the most dancing are the ones who are ""naked"" The main characters who are not dancers are the ones who get the outfits. This is purely a functionality thing. Both it saves on the cost of CGI and it allows the dancers more freedom to move.

Now my philosophy has always been if you have to explain that the movie was actually good, it probably wasn't.

The above simply explains away some the critics baffling statements. But don't mistake that for me thinking this was a great movie. It wasn't. It was OK. It was fun to watch.

That said there was plenty wrong with this movie. For the plot.....Its Cats. The plot has always been almost nonexistent. They could have, and should have expanded on that. Was it bad? No. Its a straight forward concept. New person thrown into a new situation so the audience is learning about her environment as she is learning. A cat at the end of the evening is picked to.....move on by Judi Dench during that time cats are auditioning to be picked. During that time plans are afoot. This is not a complicated plot. Its a plot designed to carry music numbers in it from A to B to C to D. That is all.

Now one suggestion would have been to added a little more Disney musical in that the music numbers are interspersed with dialog. To give a bit more breathing room between the music numbers as I think it was breaking the poor critics brain.

Next was the cuts in this movie. A lot of, IMHO, bad edits. Jennifer Hudson when singing the iconic Memory was cutting away from her for reaction shots. It broke the mood. There are other examples of that that felt like the camera should have lingered longer. Speaking of Jennifer Hudson. Wonderful job but, and it was mentioned by another review that I rolled my eyes at but is legit. She cries as she is singing. Sure. Fine. While it brings emotional weight to the scene......we really didn't need the runny nose. Really it was distracting to see that.

The interesting thing that I found with critics. Is there are factually inaccurate statements in their reviews. Things that can be quantified. One review complained about the lack of locations. The only major change in location was a railway track on a bridge. Other then that it was just an ally and a theater. That is factually inaccurate. I counted 10 distinct locations. So why the inaccuracy. I suspect that folks were so intent on the cat characters (Ears moving, tail moving, fury moving.) that it distracted from actually paying attention to the film. I wasn't bugged by this because its anthro cats....So? I think anyone not furry needs to see this at least twice. The reviews are blasting this movie when I've seen far worse movies with far worse CGI, far worse stories, and far worse characters all the while getting far better ratings. What's the difference? People are losing their crap because its people CGI morphed into cats."
1.0,30 September 2021,"The movie started with quite a good song ... a song that made me feel good. Made me not think about the ... I'm not sure there is a safe word I can use for this mixture of cats and humans. Having said that, I am not knocking anyone off who might find this enticing. I'm not even telling that someone they should seek help ... actually all kidding aside, who knows how individuals may feel in hundreds of years ... they may mingle with DNA and clones so much, that something like what we see here becomes reality ... afraid yet? Maybe you should be, but remember: you'll probably won't be alive to see it, so there is that.

Really good actors involved in this and after that initial song ... the movie drags on (no pun intended I think, but I'm not quite sure). Puns and ""jokes"" like the one I used as summary are being used by the movie too. I have not seen the musical .. and I do think that some songs are not really bad ... but this movie ... I really don't know how anyone thought this was a good idea ... the money they spent on this ... inconceivable (to use another movies famous quote).

I'm fairly certain they only had the best of intentions and if you were actually able to enjoy this ... good for you. Really, not being sarcastic. But if you haven't watched it yet ... well if you are not a glutton for punishment like I am, you probably will stop watching after 10-20 minutes ... you have been warned. This is not Schrodingers cat ... the cat is out of the box."
1.0,22 December 2019,Worst movie ever made it's insane. I'm assuming the few good reviews of this movie on here are from people who worked on the movie. What a waste of money and effort.

1.0,30 December 2019,"I'm kind of wondering what people were expecting. This is pretty much a CGI 2020 Cats, with a few weird additional changes, some pacing that could have been faster, and some less impressive vocals. But honestly, I don't understand what was so upsetting. Has anyone seen the original? It makes very little sense to begin with! It's a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway! If you're a fan, I feel like you got what you were expecting. It was FINE. Not great, not awful. Fine. My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was, but other than that, calm down. Seriously. This was not the worst 2 hours I've spent in a movie theater this year. I can name 20 movies that were more painful."

4.0,24 December 2019,Why??! Just why??! It's for real or just a joke??! Worst and boring movie ever
1.0,20 December 2019,"This is not the stage show. It is a musical film with singing cats. If you do not like the sound of this, why would you want t see it?

On the other hand, if you want to see some well choreographed and well filmed dance sequences with fantastic songs, you are in for an entertaining couple of hours.

The film looks good and the humanesqe faces on the cats does wonders in expressing emotion. The cast is generally excellent and their enthusiasm helps invest in the characters.

There are some miss-steps along the way. Interrupting some of the songs disrupts the rhythm. Some of the SFX don't work well and a couple of sequences don't work to well.

Cats succeeds non the less in being highly entertaining and memorable."
1.0,20 December 2019,"I've seen the stage musical and it's one of the worst out there; it's built around one great song, Memory, and that's all it has going for it. I had no expectation that the film would be better, but was instantly intrigued when the first images came to light. The translation wasn't at all what I expected, but I was ready to take a trip to that uncanny valley.

Now, having seen it, it's quite the spectacle, and not in the way it's intended to be. The CGI is all over the place and it's astounding that they released it in the shape it's in. Faces move, but heads don't move accordingly; bodies look like they're floating, with the feet so manipulated by the effects they don't actually look like they're touching the ground; bodies look distorted to the point that their movements look artificial, when so much effort was put into the choreography. The problems are just so evident.

Yet, while watching this chaotic mess of a film, I found myself enjoying every moment. It's like a game, where you start looking for what's wrong in each frame, and there's plenty to uncover. Sure, the cast looks like they're having a decent time, but wondering why none of them thought twice about this being a disaster also supplies some sort of excitement, because it's the kind of bad that is actually fun to experience. I'm glad this exists. It's full of wonder and mania, fluctuating between terror, confusion, and amazement, often in one fell swoop.

Embrace the curiosity, grab a drink or four beforehand, and just succumb to this marvelous piece of eventual cult cinema that will be giffed for decades to come. If anything's certain, you've never seen anything like this before and it's hard to imagine anything else coming close to it anytime soon."

2.0,2 January 2020,Just a fun fact if you ignore the stupid plot and the scary ps2 faces and focus your attention on the feets of the characters (especially in the background) you can see that the cats hover along the surface.

If you are expecting a stage show XL you won't."

1.0,31 December 2019,"A nonsensical plot, the worst CGI I've seen in years and the worst scene (the Rebel Wilson with cockroaches on a cake) I can recall in a movie. The film simply should have been thrown out at the drawing board stage. It really does deserve every one star review it's receiving. The only positive was the performance of Francesca Hayward who was seriously let down by everything else from production, direction, CGI and other performances from the A list cast. Haywood deserved more but it's an absolute mess of a film."
3.0,31 December 2019,"Not even a large can of tuna topped with catnip could fix this atrocity. A few safety tips before going into the theater to see this. 1. Plant your entire face into a bowl of bleach, keep your eyes open (it's worth it, trust me!) 2. Buy a box of cotton swabs, soak them in gasoline and then shove as many as possible into each ear until you can't fit anymore, then use a lighter (a match will do) and light both ends. 3. If you survived all of this and your still seated at the movie, repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed."

1.0,14 January 2020,"I'm well behind with my reviewing following the Christmas break, so I don't have much hope of coming up with anything new for one of the most critically derided films of the year . . . but let's try anyway. I have been to see the musical, staged by a reputable touring company, and frankly I hated it. This is not some reaction to the genre, I've seen a number of them, and I like musicals. But ""Cats"" is an artless, plotless, pointless show, with one half decent song and lots of hideous synthesizers that betrays its 80's inception. The film is actually better than the musical in one sense, but in many others is a garish, embarrassing fever dream.

Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is a young cat tossed into the streets by an unseen owner. She meets the various cats that live on the streets of London, around the theatre district. She comes on a special night though, as tonight is the Jellicle ball when the show off in an attempt to convince Old Deuteronomy (Judy Dench) that one of them deserves to be reborn.

So, I think I've already cleared up what I think of ""Cats"" the musical. The best production in the world would still be the worst choice you could make to spend your time watching and the movie is pretty far from the best production. It does have one improvement. Rather than just two hours of characters introducing themselves, there is a bit of a plot now! Idris Elba's McCavity kidnapping his rivals to make himself the most likely Jellicle choice. Smart. Like it. In terms of other positives. . . .erm . . . I suspect, if you like Ballet, you'll get something out of some of the dances. Maybe.

Those meagre positives don't come close though to making up for the hideous other worldly visuals of the CGI blending of the actors with bits of cats. . . sometimes it's little better than a snapchat face-swap app. Scale of the characters varies wildly, depending on the scene and in hardly any of them is comparable to an actual cat. Corden and Rebel Wilson are terrible in their roles. Jason Derulo can at least sing, even if his character is as embarrassing and everyone else's. Jennifer Hudson steps all over ""Memory"" with an emotional performance that comes at the expense of the song.

People are going a little overboard with their criticism, it's not the worst film ever. It's probably not even the worst film of the year (though I admit I'm struggling at the moment to think of one) but it is pretty awful."
1.0,14 March 2021,"Wish I could review the reviews. It seems there's an incredible critical bandwagon built on reviewers who expected something other than humans weirdly pretending to be cats. If you don't like the theatrical version and have never read the poems, then you probably won't like it. If you know and like both, then you'll appreciate the movie. It could've been better, especially with more dancing, but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic, and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add. It's fun, nonsensical, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."

What on Earth is this crap? There's no comparison to your illustrious back catalogue of movie going genius. WTF!

This isn't even remotely the same film you once led Hollywood with. What's happening, not one title of the above mentioned standard has impacted film for a very uncomfortable and worrying, long time.

What is happening over there? Get new talent in! Risk it up! Get the old film feeling back! Modern film is smothered in risk free flapping flops that aren't so risk free and are creating the same amount of loss of money as any give it ago and make it original early works you instigated. You invented modern cinema get back to it!

What have you got to lose?

Stop making this stuff. 2.7 (and reducing) out of 10 is a wake up call. Do it for the love not the projected readership/following ticket sales.

Original ideas are evaporating in film you all have the power to change this.

It's not looking good for film. Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese are right.

1.0,27 February 2021,"I love musicals, I grew up going to the theater and also watching them on TV. Unfortunately Cats was one I was less familiar with. No matter what I was still excited for it. I watched it the first time and was fairly confused the first half. Then once I was in the proper mindset and listened to the words of the music it was beautiful. A couple days later I watched it again with a new appreciation and loved it."
1.0,20 December 2019,"It's a shame to see all these extremely negative reviews that are presenting this film as if it is the bloody emoji movie. They've clearly not seen the original which is just as bizarre and slightly confusing (in a good way). It is not striving for a crystal, intricate plot, it is artistic in choreography, music, set, the use of CGI - not straying too far from the original but has added in a clearer way of seeing the story and wonderful casting and a beautiful new song. Jennifer Hudson's performance of Memory was extremely emotional just as the original. Not only was it beautiful, it was entertaining generating frequent laughs and a constant interest. People should see, appreciate and praise this film."

It's so rare that I feel nothing from a movie, absolutely nothing."
1.0,20 December 2019,"A few days ago, someone on Twitter joked that the reviewers who had just beheld Tom Hooper's Cats on the big screen sounded like Lovecraftian protagonists. I tend to agree, as I recently read on Facebook: ""When you see these things switch between acting like people and acting like cats, you'll think you mistakenly read a page of the Necronomicon Ex Mortis"".

What sort of dark, dreary mistake must've been made in our history that it came to the point where this... thing... was green-lit by a major studio? Who is this for? Is this what fans of the original musical want? Are kids supposed to enjoy it? Adult furries?

Furthermore, what is it that is so goddamn difficult to understand about live-action remakes, especially the ones with talking animal characters? When we panned the Lion King remake because its photorealism subtracts the magic and expressiveness of singing felines, we didn't mean you should try doing singing felines in live-action AGAIN but this time with characters that are some sort of unholy alien hybrid between man and cat, and can therefore emote slightly more. What we meant, more so now than ever before, is STOP!

Cats, as most of you are cursed to know, doesn't dress its dancers up in kitty costumes as per the original stageplay's tradition, nor does it opt for Disney-style CG animals in the place of actors. Instead, it sort of blends the two, giving us digital furry counterparts to Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, Jason Derulo, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench, just to name a few.

I don't why digital adjustments needed to be done to these poor performers, as opposed to giving them real-life kitty suits. It makes us suspect that the dancing isn't wholly authentic (computers might have added some magic there), which is a shame since one of the leads is Francesca Hayward, dancer at the Royal Ballet, in her film debut. She has played everything from Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty, to The Sugar Plum Fairy and Juliet Capulet. She deserves far better.

Aside from the night-terror visuals and accompanying cat-person noises, there isn't much to write home about here. If one can get used to the film's agonizing/agonized universe and excuse the possibility that we're not beholding wholly undoctored dancing, it's still pretty useless.

The story (such as it is) is the story of Cats, plus some dumb jokes (thanks Rebel Wilson), celebrity cameos for generations Y through Z to enjoy, and other things that stretch it thin. The lovely but narratively useless songs from the Andrew Lloyd Webber production are there, plus some new additions to ensure a Best Original Song nomination, because that's what remakes and adaptations of musicals do, I guess. Hooper's Les Miserables film did it; the Beauty and the Beast remake did it; the Aladdin remake did it; now this.

The best thing to come out of this film was a mashup someone made of the Cats trailer and the unsettling Annihilation soundtrack, partially because it was funny, but mainly because it confirms that random Internet users often have a more solid grasp of what makes a good movie and which images go with which mood than Hollywood professionals. Put some obnoxious Benny Hill music over the recent Rise of Skywalker and we have another example.

Sadly, I fear the best meme material we got was from the initial trailer. Some fans and cineasts speculate that film studios are doing this on purpose; creating meme-worthy magnitudes of ugliness to help spread the word of their movies. There's even a theory that Sony's non-hideous redo of Sonic the Hedgehog was ready to go before the Internet had torn the initial design a new one; they just wanted the film to reach meme status first. That sounds a little too smart and 21st century-savvy to be true, though."

1.0,28 December 2019,"My Review Cats - my Rating 8/10.

As anyone knows who reads my page I like musicals and have acquired some knowledge of this genre over the years . There have been some woeful Screen adaptations of famous Stage musicals eg A Chorus Line (1985) Man of La Mancha 1972 ,Camelot 1967, A Little Night Music 1977 to name a few.

The 2019 Tom Hooper "" Cats""does not deserve the vendetta of bad press by so called Professional Critics who I think don't understand the genre of the film musical at all.

I'm taking time over my Review as I want people to see this film ,it will polarise some people . I went with my regular film partner and he didn't care for it.

I on the other hand enjoyed it very much I had read a little of the bollocking this movie is receiving and also a review yesterday from a friend who also knows the musical stage and film genre so I was so pleasantly surprised to be in the minority camp of people who praise this innovative reworking of a stage musical . Cats has already been filmed in 1998 with the original Griizabella Elaine Paige .If you want to see cats filmed in a studio pretty much as it was on stage the 1998 version may appeal more to your tastes .

If you expect to hear the best vocal version of the hit song from Cats ,Memory sung by Jennifer Hudson you won't hear it in this version but her performance as the tired bedraggled and world weary Grizabella is the best acting performance I've seen of anyone in this pivotal role I can understand why her version is so full of pain.

I notice IMBD give the 1998 version a 7.6 Rating and this new version a measly 2.6 ?

It's terribly unfair and doesn't give credit to the acting and technical expertise that has gone in to this production.

The 1998 version while authentic to the stage production doesn't expand the horizon of the wonderful world of Cats or add anything new the 2019 version does.

Critics can unfortunately ruin a films prospects at the box office I hate the phrase some friends use "" oh I didn't go and see it because it got rotten reviews "" I always say make up your own mind I've seen so many enjoyable movies that the critics have panned and I've seen some very average films that some critics wax lyrically about.

This new version of Cats directed by Tom Hooper ( The Kings Speech, The Danish Girl, Les Miserables) who also was a screenwriter with Lee Hall on this project features some great talent and magical moments . It's a very different setting to the stage production which was basically a big rubbish tip. It pays homage to other screen musicals ,especially Busby Berkeley and Mrs Henderson Presents. Dame Judi Dench was Mrs Henderson and that film was set in The Windmill theatre which also features in this as a set for Cats.

The rest of the scenes are in London itself in various locations like Trafalgar Square The Thames and a fabulous production number performed by Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat on a rail bridge to a great London station.

Francesca Hayward a Royal Ballet principle is wonderfully cast as Victoria the elegant timid White Cat who is dumped in the alley where the tribe of Jellicle cats are competing and waiting for their one of them to be chosen by Old Deuteronomy to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.

The plot is basically just that and it's based on a collection of poems by T. S. Elliott . Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs introduce all the characters like Bombalurina, Macavity, Mr Mistoffelees , the magician played so well by Laurie Davidson. James Corden as Bustopher Jones the fat cat in spats is fun Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is Rebel Wilson.

Idris Elba as Macavity the villain of the piece is also very good in the role.

Terrific choreography very different in parts to the stage production in fact it's the younger less known actors that are the Stars of this film apart from Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Dame Judi I think is wonderful as Old Deuteronomy in fact her final scene in Trafalgar Square moved me to a few tears. Ian McKellen is also wonderful as Gus The Theatre Cat and both these veterans of British theatre add great pathos and class I imagine the rest of the young cast must have felt privileged to be in this film.

If I go to see a film adaptation of a musical I want it to be more intimate than the stage version and to transport me and inspire my imagination. I didn't like Tom Hoopers last musical film Les Miserables mainly for live singing if you can call Russell Crowe's voice singing but also because to me it lacked intimacy ,but I must say he has won me over in his latest musical Cats.

Please Ignore the negative critical onslaught on this film adaptation of Cats ,make up your own mind . The estimated cost budget of this musical is USD 95,000,000 you can see every dollar spent in the sets and production numbers .The film is doing very poorly due to bad press and deserves a much better reception I hope for the sake of future musical films it does succeed."
4.0,27 December 2019,"Drama adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's long running and very successful stage play. I've never seen the sage play, so wasn't familiar with the plot and didn't know what to expect.

I liked most of the music, dancing and the cinematography. However, my wife (who is not a huge fan of musicals) said she was quickly bored by the amount of consecutive musical scenes.

If you like musicals you'll like this. If you like dance you'll like this.

I don't understand how this is attracting so many poor reviews, you might like given a chance, but if you blindly follow the opinion of professional reviewers then probably best you miss this."

Never seen the stage play yet and hoping could entice me to watch it in the near future, but now after seeing it kinda doubtful of it. Don't get me wrong the costume, props were amazing but establishment of characters, sound editing and mixes for me are out of tune and coincidentally I'm tired before watching the movie and eventually fell asleep almost throughout, a rare for me as a movie fan as a whole!

But at some point, SOMEONE must have seen the dailies, right? At that point, it was not too late to shut it down or maybe go a different direction. What went wrong at that stage?"
1.0,27 December 2019,"Okay, ya'll I watched this movie a few days ago thinking it would be funny to riff on.

Don't.

The story is awful. The comedy is awful. It looks awful (it actually made me feel sick). The CGI looks like it was done by a drunk film student. The cinematography is awful and covers up the choreography (the only thing the movie maybe had going for it). There's a cut like every 2 seconds and it is way too zoomed in half the time. Even the music with all the celebrity voices and talent behind it, is bland at best. Also the singing and sound mixing is done in a way that you can barely understand the lyrics, which is important given that the movie is ENTIRELY SINGING. Yeah, that's right, there is no dialogue in this movie, and you can only half understand the singing. It doesn't even matter, considering the movie has like, no story. There is nothing, and I mean NOTHING good about this movie. Don't see it.

Love Musicals? Don't watch this. The music isn't good, and the choreography is covered up. The story is awful. I wouldn't even listen to the music on Youtube. Watch ANY other musical movie. I like musicals myself. But this? No.

Like Cats, the musical? Don't watch this. I've never watched Cats, but based off of what I hear people like about Cats, this takes away anything you could've liked about Cats (choreography is covered up, costuming is gone cause its all CGI, and music is bleh)

Think it'll be funny to riff on? No. Don't. Do anything else. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go out for dinner with a friend. Take a nice stroll. Play video games. You could stay in bed all day for all I care. My life is worse after watching this movie.

It might sound like I'm overreacting, but I promise you that if you see this movie, you WILL regret it. Please. Just Don't."

1.0,22 December 2019,"I've got to say I was really apprehensive about watching this after reading reviews as cats is one of my favourite musicals ever but I absolutely loved it, the production, the effects etc were all brilliant. Now I went with my partner and his daughters who only thought it was OK but they've never seen the original or watched many musicals. So my review is if you're a big cats fan like me then you'll love this, if you've never heard of it before today or not seen the original then you'll not enjoy it as much."
4.0,23 December 2019,"But it's technically a bad musical. So its actually a pretty decent adaptation (and I've seen the musical too). The appeal of Cats is the songs and the musical numbers, and the movie did right by both.

The musical numbers were terrific and the big name singers all delivered. And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape. Crazy. My body was ready for anthropomorphic cats but it was not prepared for.... well, i won't spoil the craziness. All i'll say is that I've never seen anything like it."

3.0,22 December 2019,"It also doesn't deserve such a low score, I've not seen the theatre production and I don't think I will be, the songs just felt like the same songs and nothing made an impact apart from Jennifer Hudson doing 'Memory' There were some parts that was just cringy and Corden and Rebel felt like pointless comic relief. Don't get me wrong I love Judi Dench and Ian McKellen but I don't think they can sing, and for a movie that is basically one bit song they didn't work for me. The CGI was good in most parts of the film but there was some parts where their faces didn't match with the heads and one part where Mckellens eye just looked wrong! I have no idea why or how? Anyway a far from Purrfect film... Dam it!"
9.0,21 December 2019,"Honestly, I don't know how expectation here ever got beyond what the project always said on the tin. Humans dress up as cats and sing a mixed bag of songs and it's sort of a fabulous hot mess. If this premise is for you, then you'll like it. If it's not, you won't. (See also: Cats the musical.)

Increasingly we are allowing ourselves to be pushed towards extremes of opinion on everything, and it's ruining our ability to see the shades of truth in between. The CGI in Cats bothered me far less than De Niro's waxy face in The Irishman (a film I liked far better than this, in spite of its needless miscasting).

The scale problems didn't bother me much because I just suspended disbelief. I'm watching a movie in which cats sing, so really I'm not looking for dimension realism.

Jennifer Hudson belts THAT note out, and it's a bit of a moment, but I'm not sure her sobbing throughout the song was the appropriate creative choice for the lyrics. But Judi Dench has bags of cheeky fun, and Laurie Davidson is a charismatic Mr Mistoffelees.

Honestly, I left the cinema feeling like I'd seen a perfectly OK movie which couldn't be a lot better because the inherent source material isn't all that brilliant.

To dismiss it outright, or enjoy kicking some pretty decent performers and dancers who enter into the spirit of it, isn't an especially balanced form of criticism."
6.0,21 December 2019,"Worst movie i've ever seen. Borderline unwatchable

-No plot -Almost no script except songs. This is ok for this type of film if the songs are good. They aren't. -Poor CGI -Poor acting -Dreadful forgettable characters, i don't even remember any of their names

Essentially it's a terrible version of Rocky Horror Show, that has human ""cats"" instead of men dressed as women.

This film has no positives aspects whatsoever, people were laughing in a bemused way when the film ended. I've never seen that reaction in a cinema before.

P.S. Cats are my favourite pet."

If you go to the movie with ridged expectations of the broadway performances you will be disappointed. However, if you go with childlike wonder, you will be blown away!

I have been brought to tears several times. The casting was near perfection. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy couldn't have been better.

Watching my teenage sons glued to the screen was priceless. This is a movie that will be added to our digital collection when it comes out. It is well worth the money to see it in the theaters."
1.0,30 December 2019,"People here love to pile on and criticize a movie without any indication they actually saw the movie. There is not a single fact about the movie in most reviews.

The Good The movie did remain relatively faithful to the original Broadway plot. Of course people may not like that version - but that is the story for Cats. The music was largely the same as the Broadway show with one new tune co-written by Lloyd Weber and Swift - and that tune was not bad. The CGI had some misses, but overall was pretty good. The people turned into cats worked well. There were some great sets.

You can't complain about Francesca Haywood. She's very talented and is a principal ballerina for The Royal Ballet. Her acting was pretty good, and she made the movie.

James Cordon did an excellent job. Robbie Fairchild was very good. Judy Dench was not perfect, but overall I liked her and her role.

The Bad Jennifer Hudson had the best song and provided a terrible job of delivering it. Terrible. With all of her emotional gymnastics, the melody of the song was gone. Her song - Memories - is the most important number in the production. Disaster.

Taylor Swift was irrelelevant. Her character had a 5-6 minute appearance late in the move for a single song. Who cares. The song was okay - an original she co-wrote. But she added nothing to the movie other than a name.

Overall, the sound quality of the music was poor - and not as good as a typical live theatrical production. With the budget and the talent available, you expected better. It seemed to have been recorded during filming live scenes with background noise and inconsistent production values.

Overall - I liked Cats. I've seen the Broadway production a couple of times, I knew what to expect, and it delivered. It's about Cats. There is no deep plot or story. Just enjoy it and have fun."

9.0,22 December 2019,"It's really hard to describe the ""experience"" of this movie without phisically flinching. Even ignoring the baffling special effects, awkward acting an horrible attempts of humor that not even a psychopath would find funny, the movie is criminally boring in every level, nothing actually happens and when it looks like plot is developing, it stops for another painful musical number with songs that in all honesty were never really that good.

This movie misses the mark on every filmmaking level that to call it a ""movie"" is an actual insult to the art form itself. Makes you actually feel sorry for movies like Sharknado that, in their mediocrity, at least can be called movies."

1.0,26 December 2019,"Go see it. If you've ever seen the theatre production then you MUST see this. If you've not seen it then go with an open mind. Read the poetry it's based on. Adapted from Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical, itself inspired by T.S. Eliot's whimsical poems ; Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. About a tribe of cats called the Jellicles. Who gather once a year to see which of their number will be given the opportunity to ascend to the Heaviside layer. Cats the movie is a slick, computer-enhanced celeb-fest with meticulously choreographed set-pieces taking place in a version of London .

Francesca Hayward's 'Victoria' a Principal Ballerina at the Royal Ballet takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. She is not exactly verbose, but her eyes talk plenty, wearing a nonplussed expression throughout as she tries to figure out what in the name of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats is going on. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays basically true to the stage musical.

If you want a visual feast, knowingly camped up performances from a stellar cast and some beautiful dance & musical numbers this film is a winner. A very well made sentiment to the original stage musical that those who have seen the West End musical will understand totally."
1.0,13 December 2020,It is not easy to move a stage musical to the screen. And I think it is very creditably done here. The singing was well done too. I did enjoy this effort.
1.0,31 December 2019,"So, I was hoping this movie would be like the musical. I LOVE the musical.

WARNING: It's so bad that as a huge cat person AND a lover or the musical Cats, I find this movie extremely offensive. I'm not even joking.

The plot is a huge mess. The songs are complete garbage. Don't even get me started on the CGI. I know that they put some sort of effort into this movie, but for 95 MILLION DOLLARS...this movie is a huge disappointment.

They obviously casted popular celebrities like Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson and James Corden so people would be more interested in the movie. I'm sorry, but this is supposed to be a musical.

If they really wanted this to be like the Cats musical, they wouldn't have casted the people they did. Yes, they are talented, but it just doesn't seem right to have James Corden or Taylor Swift in a musical-based movie (even though James' crosswalk musicals are hilarious.)

Believe me when I tell you this--the target audience is probably for 3-year-olds. I would've left if I didn't pay for the ticket. Even if 3-year-olds saw this movie, they would probably have nightmares later. Please DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It's a waste of your time."

6.0,21 December 2019,"'Cats' is the musical that introduced me to Broadway musicals. When I was a freshman in High School, I admired it so much because it was a show that had nothing but songs to listen to and choreography that blew me away. I was excited to hear that a film adaptation would be happening. I was also excited that Tom Hooper would be directing because I thought he did a pretty good job with Les Miserables (2012). After hearing all the backlash that the trailers got, I still tried to give the movie a chance to hopefully redeem itself. Sadly, it couldn't do it. One of the main problems with adapting 'Cats' into a film, is creating a plot that reasonably connects all the songs intricately. When watching the movie, it feels like there was no effort to do that. You know how people who say they hate musicals because characters dance or sing at random moments of the story for no apparent reason? That's what the movie was. The transition from one musical number to the next felt weak. In some cases we get back-to-back songs, as if we are suppose to just ignore the song that came before it. I believe most of the attention when making this movie, went more into the CGI, set designs, and paying the performers. No one really thought about the story! With a musical like Les Miserables (2012), the story and context are told through the songs. My guess is that Hooper thought that there was no need to focus on the plot because the collection of the songs would tell the story as well. If that's the case, he was absolutely wrong. The only sense of a story developing, were these two characters that fell in love with each other. I liked that, and they should have done more stuff like that. I think a lack of effort and creativity caused by some unmentioned obstacles made the movie a lot less enjoyable than it could have been."

1.0,26 December 2019,"I went to see this 20/12/2019 without seeing any of the reviews and loved it, went back again after reading the reviews and still loved it.I have seen the show. The original London cast then again in 1992 and then again at the London Palladium for the revival. The film was different there were aspects added not the same as the show. But for an entertaining evening it's excellent some of the performances are excellent Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Francesca Hayward were wonderful. I have never liked Rebel Wilson and would have preferred someone else in the part. I loved the fact that the dancers were dancers. Please support this film!! It's great 💓"
1.0,21 December 2019,"This movie has a lot of negative reviews because people were expecting a movie, not a musical. So firstly, understand it's not a traditional movie, but a musical based on the Cats play. This means there is extremely little dialogue; it's basically singing and dancing the whole time. You must have a taste for the theatre arts to appreciate this kind of work. So if you don't like musicals, you'd hate this movie.

If you judge it for what it is--a musical movie--it doesn't deserve terrible reviews, but it's also not the best either. As a musical movie, it has good choreography, transitions, dancing, singing, etc. It captures the essence of the original Cats play and its weirdness. But it has issues with enunciation, unanswered questions, over-the-top weirdness, and unnecessary dark vibes.

The actors didn't enunciate words clearly, making it very difficult to understand much of what they were talking and singing about, which also makes understanding the whole plot more difficult. They failed to explain many things in this movie, such as how did they all get there?, who exactly is the villain Macavity,? how is Macavity able to make people disappear?, why is only one cat chosen to begin a new life?, where exactly are they?, what is the Heaviside Layer?, etc. These questions (or most of them) can only be answered by researching the original Cats play, so the movie itself fails to answer some critical questions for people unfamiliar with the original story. This will leave you being very confused about a lot of things.

This musical movie is extremely weird. People in cat costumes crawling around in all fours, scratching and licking themselves, hissing, and very strange positions. Other weird things like mice and roaches with human faces. The way the cats get close to each other's faces and mouths can be very weird and even slightly sexual. The songs, the background music, the scenes, and various characters are all just super weird! On a weirdness scale of 1 to 10, it's an 11.

The movie has a dark theme that permeates everything. Dark in a creepy way, like Tim Burton style. Every scene is dark in some way. They constantly interrupt the musical flow to make it sound dark/creepy again. It goes back-and-forth with normal music/singing then sudden dark/creepy again, as if you were watching a horror movie and something bad is about to happen. These constant dark/creepy vibes are completely unnecessarily and damaging to the movie.

The biggest question of all that we had was: where exactly are they? All these abandoned cats live in some dark city that they can't escape unless they are reborn by reaching the ""Heaviside Layer"" by singing about their lives. So in summary, you can think of this movie as ""Tim Burton makes a musical"" where human-cats are trapped in some type of Cat Hell/Purgatory who have to competitively sing and dance their way out. It's one super weird musical, but not terrible. It's about a 6.5/10."
1.0,7 January 2020,"Please for your sanity and your bank balance, avoid!

This steaming pile of garbage was delivered at the 11th hour and it shows. You will never be able to un-see this travesty. The effect of pasting a person's face onto a CG fur body ranges from uncomfortable to ridiculous. I don't blame the hardworking people at the effects house. The director must be held accountable.

A boring musical theatre experience has been turned into a laughable movie.

Rather have a cat scratch my balls than sit through this codswallop again.

My family thinks this was amazing."
1.0,21 December 2019,"I'm no theater nerd, nor have I ever been to a production of Cats to truly compare. However, it wasn't as terrible as some reviewers made it out to be. No one thought to themselves that a movie about cats was going to be a little on the, I dunno, weird side?

First and foremost, the cgi was a little ratchet, but you get past that after a short time. Now THE singing by Jennifer Hudson was purely beautiful and brought tears to my eyes! The song, Beautiful Ghosts, written by my girl, Taylor Swift, and sung by Francesca, was hands down my favorite part. You could feel and understand the pain and beauty behind those two characters and it was magic. It literally filled several movie goers eyes with tears with how good it was. Did i mention Jennifer Hudson's singing of Memories 😭 oh, i did.. 👀 BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL.

One thing i would have liked better and yes i know it's based off a theater production, but more dialogue because some of the singing was... confusing and hard to understand when attempted to be sung by these A-list celebrities. Would have been a nice transition from theater to a movie adaption. My 9 year old daughter at one point whispered to me, ""mom, why are they singing the whole time.."" lol

All in all, it's not that serious y'all. It's a movie about Cats, not a hero saving the world. It's fun and entertaining and enjoyable to watch. The dancing is fun and most, not all, of the songs are great.

Did i mention my girl, Taylor Swift?! 😝"

Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film, sing the damn song and stop with the gurning! Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl. Judi Dench singing. Love her, hate that someone said ""sing it, Judi"". The balloon ride! What. The. Hell. In summary, the stage gave it the magic, on film it's just weird and cringey."

1.0,21 December 2019,"Given the all the negative reviews from users and critics, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did. I have read T.S.Eliot's ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" twice. And I have seen the stage musical 4 or 5 times in the 90s and loved it. But a movie gives you close-ups of facial expressions and (feline) interaction that is not visible on a live stage. The music was as I remembered with a few additional songs, and some spoken parts to help the narrative. The actors dressed/CGI'd as cats, is no more unexpected than they were on stage. I don't deny that people who are not at all familiar with the book nor stage production, may find the appearance of the ""cats"" to be unusual, and the songs somewhat disconnected. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it and watch it again."
1.0,23 December 2019,"CATS, 6 outta 10, select audience that can appreciate it should see it. Fell somewhere between low brow and high brow & this is why I think not many liked the final result. Cats, the movie, is not nearly as bad as critics and some fans are making it. The designs are beautiful, the perfect blend of realness to believe it in modern film world while not going too over the top & keeping the people's features. I never saw the show before this, so can't speak to the adaptation aspect of it; but it seems a lot of people hated this ultra successful show and hated the film adaptation of it following similar paths of supposedly dumbing it down for a broader appeal. Don't get me wrong: it's not a great movie, but it is (for a limited audience that will find it beautiful) memorable and worth a watch. Performances by James Corbin, Judi Dench, Ian Mckellen & another amazing performance by Jennifer Hudson is worth the price of admission alone. There's not much plot and it runs a bit too long, but has many strong moments. Does not deserve the 2.7 outta 10 it has on IMDB or the 30 of 100 it has by critics. In my mind, it's better than the poorly shot Les Mis film and the awfully bland La La Land, which were fawned over in years past."
1.0,8 January 2020,"The only thing good about this movie is a couple of the songs, which are you know, not original. The reason I give Cats a 2 and Not a 1 is that I found some of the songs enjoyable. Even if they were reused. Bleh, go waste all of your 9 lives Cats."

The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it. The makeup on the people wasn't that bad and everybody could sing, act and dance. Also there was some startling set designs--it certainly LOOKED great! I almost did walk out about 30 minutes in when a number with singing mice and tap-dancing cockroaches (I'm not kidding) started up but I stayed. It got much better after that. Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved ""Mr. Mistoffelees"" and (of course) ""Memory"". Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role. She sang ""Memory"" so beautifully I started crying. So it's not a great movie but it's certainly not the bomb people are saying it is."

They were actually doing every lift and pirouette you see, as well as convincing acting and costumes that are believable. In this film, you will find bad CGI, where there faces look like they're floating over a head. With CGI, anyone can be a ballet dancer. It's filled with weord back and forth casting. Jason Derulo is an abysmal Rum Tum Tugger, but Sir Ian McKellen is a great Old Gus. Jennifer Hudson has no weight as Grizabella, but James Corden is an alright Bustopher Jones.

5.0,21 December 2019,"First of all, it's a musical. There's supposed be more singing than dialogue. I think everyone from Elba to Hudson ( even Ian M ) did a very nice part in their roles. And I don't see how y'all think actors are ""creepy"" when they used the same tech for the Naa'vi of Avatar and they are supposed to be acting cat-like hence where the set has to be larger than normal and the name of the musical/movie. ( Unless you thought the Naa'vi were ""creepy"" too. And no I'm not bashing Avatar. I loved that movie and yes, it's better than Cats. I am just talking about the black suits with the cameras so they can capture the actors' movements and facial expressions while they add the CGI.) To each his own though.

The reviews were so bad that I had to watch the film...I was very surprised, this film isn't bad at all. In fact as far as stage musicals transferred to film go, it is good.. better than good even. I think the problem is that the reviewers that gave this 1* didn't actually understand what they were watching. It's a fantasy musical, it's supposed to be fantastical. As for the reviewers that said there is no plot or story, Cats doesn't have a plot or story because it's based on a book of poems about different cats."

1.0,18 September 2022,"I guess I should be fair and start by saying that I am originally from NYC and saw this on Broadway when it opened. I thought it was an idiotic musical and I was amazed by its gigantic success. It has one good song and that was the extent of my recommendation back then. For the life of me I could not figure out how it could possibly be filmed and I gather many others thought the same as it took so long. The best idea I heard was to make an animated version, but alas, that best idea did not occur. I wouldn't be surprised if one day it did happen though. It has a very large cast of well known actors and singers and with one small exception, they should all be ashamed of themselves. I found Judi Dench to be a bit touching and for this version that is my sole positive comment. Everyone else is simply ridiculous and that one good song is sung is ruined. This is about as big a misfire of a screen adaptation of a Broadway hit as I can imagine. It is positively beyond me how so many talented people thought this could work."
3.0,3 March 2023,"So bad it's almost entertaining...but not really.

I think they missed an angle with this production. Think of it as medicinal. Why bother with expensive medications to get you to sleep at night when there a gem like this that can put you to sleep before you can say ""the cat's in the bag"".

But on a semi-serious note I wonder whether anyone has watched this from start to finish, and if they have they deserve a medal for persistence and stamina. There is literally no character development and no respite from song to develop anything meaningful. The CGI? Is there CGI??

There is no way any accomplished filmmaker, actor, producer, or special effects artist, worked on any of this and thought it would be anything other than physically painful to watch. Every choice made while adapting this was just wrong. They had the budget to make them all real cats. Or, if they HAD to use people in costumes, why did they go with this abominable hybrid that makes everyone involved look stupid? I understand you have to perform in some silly situations when CGI is involved, but they emphasized the cringe inducing behavior. The CGI did nothing but add to the monstrosity this ended up being. There is no amount of drugs in Hollywood that would have made this seem a reasonable effort. This was some kind of practical joke, or someone had some serious dirt on the cast and crew, as I don't know how any professional was involved in this. Maybe James Corden."

I can't believe that someone could get absolutely everything wrong in a single movie. Messy and chaotic camera movement, really bad CGI, editing, colour correction, lighting. Terrible story that doesn't really go anywhere. A musical but with absolutely terrible music. Not funny slapstick jokes.

And what is with these characters, awkward people with no genitals in spandex. Can't stop thinking about those guys who get on a cheap flight to Majorca wearing a penis costume.

Is this movie meant for children (why would anyone else even want to watch it)? So then why everyone is so ugly, angry and unpleasant? The general feeling this movie leaves behind is frustration and confusion. Whoever is responsible for making it so awful should seek professional help and stop making movies."
5.0,20 December 2019,"Just watched Cats on it's opening morning in the UK.

If you appreciate musicals then you'll love Cats - nobody (not event the critics) argued the shear brilliance of the music in this film. Every song is delivered with excellence by some of the world's most well-known artists. There are comical twists and turns but I found myself indulging in every single song.

As for the story - this musical follows a very simple, linear narrative - a newly stray cat walks central London as she is introduced to a whole host of new cats. Each cat character has it's own musical performance. It's in keeping with the original theatre version. I found the linear movement from one cat to the next worked in the films favour - focusing on the music without trying to invent any kind of elaborate story line. It truely is a beautiful musical.

As a piece of entertainment, if you like musicals then you will love and quite possibly be overwhelmed by the musical magic offered here. If you don't like musical theatre then Cats has little to offer you. This is where critics have stepped low with ratings: rating Cats as a story for the masses - rather than as the simple musical it aims to be."

The singing is mostly bad as is the acting and the CGI, oh god the CGI! If you weren't scared of cats before, watching this will soon change that. Whoever thought it was a good idea to take such loveable furballs and turn them into these CGI human-cat hybrid abominations should never be allowed to work in the industry again. They're truly terrifying creatures.

The only positive for this film, aside from the fact that it does eventually end, is that you can tell the choreographers and set designers but a lot of hard work into their jobs and they really don't deserve to have their work associated with this mess. But that isn't enough to justify a score higher than 1.

On a side note, why does James Corden continue getting work? He isn't a very good actor, he can't sing and he isn't funny, yet he keeps appearing in films and TV. This has to be one of the biggest mysteries in the universe."

2.0,13 April 2021,"Disclaimer: I've not seen the original, so that probably affects how you will perceive the movie.

It wasn't that bad. It was charming in a weird, weird way. Sure, the cat effects were jarring, sure it was a little surreal bit of uncanny valley. But once you embrace that, it's funny! It's fun! It's campy! The story wasn't perfect but honestly, I had a good time watching it. There were parts that were unsettling to look at, very uncomfortable and had me saying ""is this really happening right now?"" And it was, oh believe me it was. But as long as you don't take it seriously, it's kinda cute. Like seeing an animal so ugly, it starts to look cute.

5.0,5 September 2021,"I've been a member since 2009 and have never reviewed a single movie, yet I choose to review Cats - the movie no one asked for. It took me a while to decide to watch the movie. I already knew before that this was not good. But it's like emptying a litter box, it has to be done. In addition, the film had an impressive cast.

The plot is a bit confusing and meager. An abandoned cat is joined by a group of cats who are preparing for a talent show... for cats. The judge (played by Judi Dench) decides who gets to go to the cat heaven (Heaviside Layer). In fact, the film is mostly a presentation of all the characters and their ""talents"". Even though the film is bad, it is still not a disaster as many claim, though not far from it. I appreciated the cinematography, the sets and the lighting and the color scheme. It looked much like an advanced musical in theater and not a typical Hollywood movie. But that's where everything that was okay ends. The effects, the plot, the script, the dialogues, yes everything else is really lousy. Pretty close to a cat-astrophe. Yet, this movie will go down in history, but not in a good way."

There's 4 good songs in the whole movie. They are all back to back. Otherwise, every single instant of this movie is capable of ridicule. They have terrible audio mixing, no plot, absolute chaos in tone, and the movie has about 15 endings. None of them end the movie.

For a movie that is totally about cat suicide, it's incredibly funny."
1.0,30 December 2019,"Well I'm going to give this a moderately positive score, because I enjoyed it for what it is - a movie version of a stage musical which is based loosely on T.S. Eliot's charming stories. I was accompanied by a neighbour who loves her own cats, and we had both seen the stage musical many years ago. The production uses CGI to enhance the costumes and movements of the human cast, and I think this works well. The performers are clearly still human beings dressed in cat costumes, which seems to be a look that some reviewers can't accept. I presume that some of the negative reviewers might prefer cartoon animation, but I reckon that what this movie does works well. It isn't Tom & Jerry, or James Bond, or Star Trek, or romantic comedy, or of any other conventional genre. This is a different kind of movie, and I suggest for a different kind of audience: ideally cat-ladies who have seen the stage musical at least once."
10.0,31 January 2023,"Look, this musical is a product of its time. I do not think it is fair to judge it outside of this context, because when it first opened in the 80s, it hit record breaking popularity for a reason. That is why so many stars signed on for the project. But why, why in Heaven's name did they not just put them in costumes and makeup? WHY!? They could have at least taken a note from Disney and designed anatomically correct cats with dubbed voices. Instead they chose to spend ridiculous amounts of extra money for hideous CGI to overlay the human performers. It will not matter how many times they rerelease the film with ""improved effects,"" it is never going to blend as well as, oh I don't know, the simple faux-fur that had been successfully used on stage for nearly forty years! How can anyone enjoy the impressive singing and dancing when the rest of the film was such an ugly visual distraction? It was an awful choice, and blatantly ruined the final product.

The writing didn't fair much better. Some people complained over the lack of a story, but I believe it had the opposite problem. In an attempt to appeal to a larger audience, the adapted script tried to shoehorn in a comprehensible narrative into what was otherwise intended to be a concert musical. For one, those who weren't already familiar with CATS were never going to like it to begin with. Two, if there is anything good to say about the original stage production, it was that the lack of cohesion made it delightfully abstract. Adding linearity, filler dialogue, and character subplots stripped it of all its fun while including extra layers of uncomfortable campiness to boot. CATS was never a masterpiece, but it seemed like the producers said to themselves, ""I bet we could do worse."""
7.0,6 January 2024,"Cats is a movie that you rarely see from Hollywood, one were you cant understand the thought process behind its creation. For that reason Cats may be the worst big budget Hollywood film I've ever seen. It manages to get nothing right. The movie even gets things I would've thought Impossible to get wrong. The audio mixing is atrocious, songs that could've worked such as Memories suffer because of it. The CGI, it goes without saying at this point. How a director like Tom Hooper with a cast full of great actors churned out this is beyond me. Why did anyone think this was a good career decision? With most terrible Hollywood films; even really terrible ones I can understand the intent behind them, this movie is special. It may be the worst movie because it perplexes me more than any other ever made. A movie made by an Oscar winning director, starring Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, and countless others exists in the form it does. It would be more accurate to say it wasn't released it escaped. Nevertheless, I recommend any aspiring film buff watch the film just to see what can go wrong, and what not to do."

1.0,4 October 2021,Avoid this nightmarish CGI abomination of a movie.
1.0,10 October 2020,"Tom Hooper's 'Cats' (2019) is the worst musical I have ever seen. It really pains me that the director who made one of the best musicals of all time ('Les Misérables', 2012) now comes along with one of the worst ones of all time!

'Cats' is a film that is hugely problematic on so many levels! As far as the musical numbers are concerned, there are 2 good songs (if you count the outro, perhaps 3), the rest is completely irrelevant and such a waste of your time. The storytelling is basically just not really there, it's included in the totally forgettable, unspectacular and boring songs.

It cannot be stressed enough just how stupid the entire film is! The concept of the story is actually quite interesting, it deals with the reincarnation process. The huge problem is the execution! The story can be found within the songs, HOWEVER these songs are mostly inaudible! It is so hard to understand anything and quite frankly, you just don't really care about anything because you are so distracted by the ridiculous look of the cats!

This has to be one of the weirdest and most confusing films I have ever seen in my entire life and I have seen some really weird stuff, but THIS took it to a whole new level! Taylor Swift was a bit of a marketing gimmick since she is barely in the film. James Corden played the only cat who I found remotely interesting. While Jennifer Hudson's character was not appealing to me whatsoever, her musical and acting performance on the other hand was outstanding! She put so much emotion into her role (specifically talking about one song at the end) that I almost thought that I should care more. That's how good she was!

As one critic put it (and I paraphrase), ""This is the worst thing that happened to cats since dogs"". You know what? That's a great statement that totally applies for this peculiar situation!

With that, I will come to my conclusion! Overall, 'Cats' is a horrific musical that could have been much better, yet the film suffers from an identity crisis. It doesn't know whether these characters are supposed to be cats or humans?! At the end of the day, you see human beings in cat costumes acting like they're cats and it is horrible and very cringy to watch as well as really unsettling overall! 2/10"
1.0,27 December 2020,"Have seen worse. I didnt fall asleep (which is a good barometer for a film). Didnt like Jason Derulo (sp) but I dont like his vocals anyway, also not a fan of Rebel Wilson or James Corden. The main chorus parts were fab (ie the stage performers) and even Taylor Swift did a fantastic job. Jennifer Hudson did murder Memories though and I wish I could un hear it. All in all I'd rather watch this again than have to sit through Avatar (which IMO is the worst film EVER!)"
1.0,8 April 2022,"I feel bad about how terrible the movie is, because you can see the effort that went into from the actors side.

I was uncomfortable with the costumes and idea of cats with human faces.

Nevertheless, Jennifer Hudson gives a stunning, emotional performance that s vocally radiant and chilling."
1.0,5 November 2023,"(And even WITH Rifftrax, it's hard to not want to look away. This movie is UGLY.)

NOTHING about this movie is good. Absolutely zip. Special effects? Garbage. Acting? Abysmal. The songs? Stupid. The plot? What plot?! And when it's not bad, it's weirdly boring.

I remember seeing the trailer and asking aloud ""who asked for this? WHO?! And can I hurt them?"" It really, truly is THAT bad. I promise. Even if you actually like the musical (that in and of itself is so niche), you will not have a good time.

My best recommendation is to get stoned off your ass and put on some Kevin, Mike, and Bill. And when you're done, pass around the eye bleach. Don't be stingy!"
1.0,20 December 2019,"I had to write a review because I hate that people don't understand the theatricality of the original show and the movie. The stage show is a spectacle. It really has no story. It is a song and dance show with performers in form fitting spandex costumes with tails, ears, fur and makeup. The movie takes the show and heightens that spectacle with realistic sets and locations. In place of the spandex, it is now CGI fur and tails. It's not any weirder than the stage version.

What I loved about the movie is the fact that there is a story now. It is seen through the eyes of Victoria. I loved the changes to the script to really connect the cats. Adding to the Macavity story and making him more present in the story. Victoria's journey with Munkustrap as we meet all the Jellicles. Mr. Mistoffelees getting a stronger story line added so much to his solo song.

The performances were amazing. Robbie Fairchild was perfect as Munkustrap. His vocals, dancing and acting performance really helped to draw the audience into the story. Ian McKellen's Gus had me in tears. His performance is truly stunning and the work of a master craftsman. Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella was phenomenal. It was so emotionally moving. Francesca Hayward was incredible as Victoria. Her portrayal was so innocent, graceful and her Beautiful Ghosts was so haunting."
1.0,8 January 2022,"If you remain open-minded, it is actually entertaining movie. I'd rather watch this than some Indiana Jones movie rerun. I'd consider it 7 ½. It isn't good movie in sense that it would be an 8, but I would actually more than happily watch it again. And that is one of my key-criteria on what is 8. Just be open-minded, don't expect it to be remake of Elaine Paige's Cats (1998). If you view it as standalone film, it is solid way to entertain. Worth a watch, if you have otherwise nothing else to watch than some reruns. Yes it's badly made and doesn't honor the magnificent Cats-musical, but it still manages to entertain. And that's typically what you want from a movie."

1/10 for being overtly pretentious."
1.0,26 December 2019,We went to see this movie despite the reviews. Cats has always been one of my favorite musicals. I've seen it 4 times on broadway. This creation was a pile of crap left in the litter box. The songs were crap and the acting was worse. We had to leave after they destroyed mongojeri and Rumpleteasers song. Just save time and money and stick needles in your eyes. Ugh hated this movie so much.
1.0,25 December 2019,"But that's what this movie makes them to be. I know they got the same director, but please, they are all miserable and make us feel that rats and racoons are way more fortunate and frivolous. If you think the most anticipated song of the whole show, Memory , could do no wrong after a long torturing waiting-time? It went terribly wrong and disappointing, but ""I only expected this 3 minutes to be ok, I expected nothing more!"".... This song sung by Jennifer Hudson had got to be good..... Wrong, it's the worst moment of the entire movie, it was way over done, it's NOT a stage show, it's a movie, but the director thought he did the sad sappy thing in Les Miserables and "" let's repeat history again"" and no need to build up her character !!! And then, the makeup, costumes, choreography ? >>> way way way TOO SAFE!!! Especially the choreography. I would pay double of what I paid for this movie just to watch a dance-scene of a Bollywood movie. I should have just stayed home and listened to Barbra Streisand and Barry Manilow singing Memory , over and over again."
1.0,21 December 2019,"Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the ""trailers"" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer."
10.0,10 June 2021,"I saw Cats at the New London Theatre in the early 80s with the original cast and was blown away. Wayne Sleep even sat on my lap during one scene, I was smitten. My parents bought the gatefold vinyl and I grew up singing the songs.

So when I heard it was being made into a film I was dubious. How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats? And then it was released to such bad reviews and scorn, I really didn't know if I wanted to ruin my memory of the show.

But....it really isn't that bad. Yes, it's weird in places but I honestly don't know how they could have made it more ""realistic"" - it's about singing cats....

I loved hearing all the songs again and I enjoyed it. Worth a look if you are a massive fan of the show."

To adventurers like me that like a good challenge: I was naive too once. About 30 minutes ago. But oh, was I wrong. This is in another league. I grew up on the likes of Disaster Movie.

This movie should be properly classified as a violent crime against my eyes and ears, not to mention against good taste in general. I guess I do have to admit that the costumes, the set and props as well as the CGI artists did a wonderful job, but God, why did anyone think this was something worth creating?! Does anyone taking part in it seriously thing that it is good?! Really?! Even if Movies are only created for money nowadays and real cinema is dead, I demand to be paid for watching this instead!

If you go into this movie, ready to inspect every detail and wondering ""Wait.. how did this happen, or why did this happen?"" then you are very much so missing the entire essence of this show. This movie takes you into a different world and you don't leave it till the very last second. Have fun, enjoy the weird, and let the memory LIVE AGAIN.

6.0,26 December 2019,"While I think the movie did miss a few marks and had areas of improvements, there are several shining moments and IS entertaining.

My two biggest complaints are: the CGI-imposed faces and Jason Derulo's Rum Tum Tugger.

Overall, I was ok with the hybrid human/cat characters but the faces often looked like they were misplaced in the head, a technical glitch one would assume was fixable.

Jason Derulo is very talented, but this Rum Tum Tugger really had zero charisma. I think he was cast as a result of some sort of equation that factored name recognition/ talent/cost. An unknown that ""popped off the screen"" would've been better.

Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, and Judi Dench all had wonderful performances. Francesca Heyword and her character were perfect guides to the world of Jellicle cats.

Taylor Swift, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson all gave good performances. Not award-winning in my view, but certainly very good for what their parts required.

The rest of the main casts are relatively unknowns but all performed very well. I especially liked Laurie Davidson's Mr. Mistoffelees.

I thought the lighting and cinematography was breathtaking; and the dance numbers ranged from ""just ok"" to ""pretty cool"".

I've seen Cats on Broadway, at a casino, a relatively large auditorium, a local theater group, and a London Thereafter recorded stage performance filmed in the 80s or 90s, and I would rate this movie as the 2nd or 3rd most enjoyable. The Broadway , Winter Gardens, was the best and the local Theater Group was 2nd but movie was much better than the others.

I think the piling on of bad reviews is unjustified and probably more of a result of a sort of mob mentality rather that of mass of movie goers who are genuinely appaled but this film."

I can't even form a proper review. The movie was awful. The acting was subpar. The theatre I watched it in had about forty people when the movie started. By the time it was over, there were maybe five of us left. Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory was the only thing I enjoyed, but damn, I would have rathered just download the song. The CGI was awful. The costumes were so odd! Some cats wore clothes, the others didn't. Every cat was morony, it was awkward and uncomfortabe. The humour was unfunny. Do not waste your money.

1.0,28 December 2019,"All right. It's easy to simply say this is one of the worst movies in a long time. I'll try to make a couple of constructive comments. If you've ever seen the filmed version of Hamlet with David Tennant or the filmed version of Death of a Salesman with Dustin Hoffman, that is the way Cats should have been adapted to the screen if they were going to do it live action. It should have been a filmed stage production with maybe a couple of cinematic flourishes such as some close-ups, and normal stage costumes, not CG. Or they could have made a fully animated version, that would have worked as well. Aside from all the technical errors related to scale - the cats vary in size literally from one shot to the next - and other technical errors like Judi Dench's wedding ring clearly visible because her hands weren't CG'd properly - the story itself is gibberish. I have never seen the stage production of Cats and had only heard one of the songs. I gather that when they wrote the script they tried to impose some sort of story where one had not been. They failed utterly, as this story makes absolutely no sense. That is to say, again, they simply should have adapted the exact same production to the screen and kept it simple.

The failure of this movie is a really good example of how one or two ill-conceived decisions at the very beginning of pre-production can doom a project to failure no matter how hard and sincerely the actors and technicians may try to pull it together."
1.0,4 January 2020,I get that the CGI was scary and weird. And I really don't like that the movie tried to give it a big antagonistic plot And comic relief.

""Cats"" is definitely the lesser movie, but still the concept is interesting, the digital fur fascinating, the singing can be terrific, and the dance moves (ballet, hip hop, Fosse, and tap) are great. If dancing, singing cats isn't your thing and if you're not a cat person, best go see some other film. This one's definitely for diehard fantasy fans. Also, if cat-like people or people-like cats with digitally twitching tails and ears freak you out, then stay away."

Say what you want about the music and the songs, the costumes and how everything was scaled to the actors being cat sized just didn't work.

The stage show was much better. See that if you can. Avoid this at all costs."

10.0,9 April 2021,"But... Why such bad reviews? I expected to hate this but I found it entrancing and trippy, I couldn't stop watching the ears and tails, I fully understand why people might hate it, but for me it was just plain weird strange and oddly enjoyable, don't be put off and give it a go I guess it's the marmite of films but I love marmite."
6.0,1 January 2020,I am a musical theatre person and love musicals. The sets and dancing and songs/singing were beautiful. I went to see this movie with my friend and we were nothing going into it expecting to laugh at how bad it was and we ended up actually enjoying it. The thing I have to say that brought the score down was the fact that the faces are so weird and the cats have human hands and not actual hands and also the plot was really weird. Other than that the movie was actually pretty good!

1.0,27 December 2019,"That was 2 hours of cats introducing themselves. That may be what people sign up for if they go to see this movie, but I went in blind. Judy Dench looked like the cowardly lion. My friend went out as soon as they started introducing railway cat, 8 minutes later after a while he came back and they were still introducing railway cat. The cgi was.. any longer than 3 seconds of person-cat face-time was very, very unsettling. It was pure awfulness with lots of talented people trying their best to make it watchable and the director still managed to fail. You should go see it 🐱🐱🐱"
1.0,1 January 2020,"It's this kind of film that piques your curiosity because it might just be so bad it's entertaining in a cheesy campy way... Except it's not. Go and spend 2 hours on something with more suspense, better character, more entertaining value... like watching your toenails grow!"

1.0,21 December 2019,I love movies. and this is the first movie i fell asleep to cause it was that boring. omg they never spoke a single word for the first 20 minutes. all they did was dance and sing and i didn't really get the concept of the movie. James cordon and rebel wilson were so funny tho!! other than that the movie really sucked and it's a one star for me.

Don't listen to the bullies who trash this movie, give it a shot and I promise you'll love it."

1.0,8 February 2020,"I feel like just saying this movie was bad is not giving it enough credit.

Yes this movie was bad, it was awful. But honestly it was so awful that it turned into a ridiculous almost dream-like experience. For a while I was convinced that we had been duped, it was just a joke, that it was impossible for this movie to actually have been made. I couldn't believe that it cost $70 million to make this below amateur schlock. But it was real. It was real and it was shocking.

Like if not for the bad story telling, lack of plot, and seemingly never ending pointless musical numbers, the craftmanship was just not good. It looked rushed and just thrown in there or at the very least unfinished. The actors CGI feet seemed to be floating throughout most of the film. Splotchy green screen rendering left bodies looking comically pixelated around the edges. There was even a scene in which an actor's pants looked completely detached from their body, I'm talking full on blob void between body and clothes. Their faces were just floating on the bodies, almost zero practical effects, just highlighting each and every mistake in disproportionate glory.

But back to the bad storytelling. So I went with a group of 4 other friends because we were interested in seeing if it was really as bad as everyone said it was (spoiler alert: its worse). And now we have this running joke that the entire movies plot was either 1. You have to bow to cats when you see them, or 2. Cats are NOT dogs. Because those are literally the only lines in the entire movie that convey any sort of message that isn't a seemingly improvised dance and song or confusing dialogue about whatever the heck a Jelical is.

Just trying to list all the errors in this movie is giving me a headache because there are so many, so I'm just gonna stop trying.

I'm not going to tell you to not watch the movie or that I didn't enjoy seeing it. Because i had a great time, but not because i enjoyed the movie itself, more I enjoyed making fun of it with my friends, who were uncontrollably laughing to the point of tears and some old lady yelling at us about how we ""ruined the movie"" (yeah no that actually happened) but so was most of the theater, almost everyone was giggling at some point. Anyways long story short: if you want to see a good movie this might not be for you. But if you want a comically (or painfully) bad movie to just laugh at, I'd definitely reccomend it."

Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe. Reader, if I were using that microscope right now, I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in this movie. Thank you for your attention ."
1.0,24 January 2020,"This is what happens when you do crack and have too many late night project approval meetings! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!! Let Hollywood know this type of mediocrity is not going to be accepted, paid for or viewed. I was dragged to it by my theater friends of friends and have no black ballad them from all entertainment decisions for our group....wow!"
1.0,27 December 2019,"Was not the fact that they casted famous actors in some roles. I was completely fine with Idris Elba, Judy Drench, Taylor Swift, and Hudson was great. I was NOT a fan of Jemima missing completely. I read that Andrew Lloyd Webber originally thought Victoria and Jemima should be one cat, but it was too difficult to find a role that could both dance and sing. My greatest annoyance is why go with that idea but cast it to someone who can do neither? Victoria should be doing splits and impressive dance acts right, left and center and the crystal clear soprano of Jemima to coerce Grizabella into keep trying would've been miles better than the new song they added. I was even ok with the talking, because I finally understood the plot. Just.. Add some cool parkour and dancing and proper singing. I'd much rather watch 2 hours of Cirque du Soleil that has nothing to do with cats with the soundtrack of the 1998 Cats film added to it than this. I don't know if they missed target audience or ran out of money on actors and CG to get some proper dancers, but please do this again in like 2025, and do it properly. This film was ok at best and should only be shown to little kids to make them understand the plot before taking them to the theatre or watching the 1998 film."
1.0,12 October 2020,I finally understand the hate this got! There's no story literally just singing throughout of which didn't look good even had mistakes in multiple scenes. I hate musicals like this especially where it's just singing and barely any regular dialogue. I'm pretty sure the bulk was bad CGI too!

10.0,1 March 2021,"Authorial intent? Entertainment value? Commitment of cast and crew? Sheer originality? Whatever you pick, Cats succeeds. It's a vile & disturbing 2000s-era pre-teen Photoshop job come-to-life; a cat-scratch-fever-dream of a movie that you don't so much ""watch,"" as it more just...sorta...HAPPENS to you; a jaw-droppingly brilliant bit of incomprehensible nonsense whose depths must be plundered...even if each trek comes out gloriously empty, the journey is always glorious."

1.0,23 December 2019,"Think for yourselves and go see this movie. I personally enjoy musicals and went to see this to enjoy a musical with my daughter and wife. I went prepared to see why everyone thought it was so awful but I must have watched a different movie because I found it mostly enjoyable. I think the problem is most are going to just hate on the movie for some reason. If you go looking for something find wrong with the film, sure, you will find plenty of items. But why go spend $10 on a ticket for that. I personally go to be entertained and that is what I was delivered. The songs are pretty good (my fave is Mr. Mestofelees) and the dancing is sublime. James Corden and Rebel Wilson weren't my favorite and Judi Dench was not a great casting choice but the rest of the cast was great. Jennifer's high notes will give you chills, Taylor nails MaCavity, and Francesca was exquisite. Yes, the CGI was not great, but is was no worse than The Hobbit, and I didn't see everyone so up in arms about that. Go see this for what it is and have a great time!!"
1.0,24 December 2019,"From Rebel Wilson missed every high notes, I was telling myself, next session might become better. Till the Jennifer Hudson, I still hoped she could save this movie from the deep somehow, but I'm wrong. I was totally disappointed, never expected this happened."
2.0,27 December 2019,Five of us three of which children walked out half way through the film it was awful it did not make any sense it jumped from scene song and dance so fast if you watched it taking a bag a magic mushrooms it might of worked but one of the worst films I've ever watched
1.0,29 December 2019,"As a tribute to the dreadful 'tunesmith' Lloyd-Webber it was a perfect career ending debacle. 10/10 for a weapon of mass destruction.

1.0,22 December 2019,"Complete and total garbage. There is absolutely nothing redeemable about this ""movie"". Andrew Lloyd Weber must have been out of his mind to sign off on this atrocity. And thank you, Jennifer Hudson, for butchering and botching Memory. I guess William Hung and Roseanne Barr couldn't clear their schedules, so they hired Jennifer Hudson to ruin the only memorable part of this script. Utter garbage."

7.0,21 December 2019,"I loved it! They didn't STRAY much at all from the original. It's just cats dancing song after song. Of course there is really no plot, there never was! I found the imagery to be neat and odd. I honestly think they took a big risk releasing something like this to the general audience. They could have changed it to make it appeal to the masses which would have yielded a better profit and review. But I'm personally glad they stayed true to what it is."
1.0,25 December 2019,"I have no clue how anyone could give this a 1. Granted, it's not the best movie ever but the singing and dancing numbers alone rate it at least a 5. Once I figured out what it was about, it improved my enjoyment. Too many people jumping on the wrong bandwagon."
1.0,24 December 2019,It's like they tried to make the movie as odd as possible to see how long viewers would last. The cats human feet will haunt my dreams until the end of my days.

1.0,11 January 2020,"In the ongoing war against human intelligence, this film qualifies as a war crime. The filmmakers and actors are war criminals. They go on trial at the Hague. And then grow old in a Jellical prison. Thankfully, they only have ONE life."

6.0,21 December 2019,"Fans of the Broadway musical will enjoy the film adaptation of Cats. The film is beautifully choreographed, well cast, and gorgeously set. The writers did a better job of explaining the storyline than the stage production. If you hate musicals or are just watching Cats to hate on it, maybe find something better to do with your time?"
1.0,24 January 2020,"I have been a stage performer for over 40 years and I have NEVER seen such a load of rubbish.During the Jellical opening number they looked like monkeys dancing(those stupid long tails flopping around).For me the star was Francesca Hayward,her dancing was ELEGANT BUT to see cats dancing ballet looked SOOOO out of place.James Corden's makeup was a joke.I felt sorry for Dame Judi,she was out of place.As an actor I am a big fan BUT.I could keep going but I have to stop because I could start getting so very negative."
1.0,27 December 2019,"Don't understand the super bad reviews and hate for this movie. I have never watched the musical so had zero expectations. I thought the movie was quite entertaining and a fun watch for the whole family. My 5 year old nephew suddenly got out of his seat and started dancing when Rum Tum Tugger was doing his thing. The kids got a good laugh out of the silly antics of Jennyanydots played by Rebel Wilson, who was essentially playing herself in all her other movies. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Rebel Wilson, Inthink she's hilarious! Absolutely loved Ian McKellan's performance as Gus and his presentation piece to contend for the Jellicle Choice. CG was able to gift this movie with realistic feline twitches and movements for the actors.

I've seen some reviews claiming there is no plot. It's quite simple, you got a bunch of cats who are contending to be selected as the chosen Jellicle to be whisked away to a new life in Heaviside Layer. Where's Heaviside Layer? Who knows? It's just some place a bunch of cats made up. Ultimately this is a movie about - well Cats! And the mystical , magical lives they lead."
1.0,3 January 2020,I hated cats afrer this movie .. Za3tar can make better cast than this

2.0,23 December 2019,"I watch a LOT of movies, this is by far the worst movie I have EVER seen! This movie is packed with celeberities. They should be ashamed of themselves and deny ever being in such a disaster. The songs were boring. The plot was non existent. I couldn't stop thinking about how bad it was for 24hrs after watching it. If someone gives you a free ticket still say no."
1.0,12 January 2020,"Even when a movie is just terrible across the board, I always look for positives. I've only ever seen a handful of movies where there weren't nuggets of good ideas or interesting decisions. Despite the design on the cats (which is bizarre but I got used to it as the movie went on), the production design of surroundings caught my eye. The movie does transport you into its world and I credit the team for that. I also thought there were a couple of decent performances, I liked Francesca Hayward as the main character Victoria, Jennifer Hudson is still an amazing vocalist as Grizabella and Ian McKellen was charming as Gus. I was also impressed with the choreography, Cats obviously had talented people involved and this isn't a case where nothing worked.

That's most of the positives from the movie, the first negative aspect I wanted to talk about was the absence of a plot. Its easier to get wrapped up in musicals, they're full of pageantry and emotion. But you still have to tell a story and other than one of these cats getting chosen to be re-incarnated.....That's it. But you can compensate with memorable or interesting characters, maybe Cats has that up its sleeve? Another big swing and a miss. A lot of these characters get their moments with a musical number but do we learn more about them? Nope. One of my issues was that minus them being strays, what's so terrible about being a Jellicle cat? Only one of them is having a really rough time (the only other one who has an argument is Gus who's age is a factor). Let them go to the other side. It seemed like something that could be figured out quickly. That's pretty blunt but this movie drives you to that point.

Getting to the rest of the cast, they range from the miscast (I felt bad for Judi Dench who kept being forced to sing when I don't think she could), to the underused (Macavity is continually hyped up but Idris Elba gets little time and little to do with that time), to the oddly picked (there was a lot of chatter about Taylor Swift but she's there maybe 5-10 minutes and while the performance is fine but just like her performing).

I'm all for a good guilty pleasure film. But if I'm going to enjoy something like that, I want something entertaining or unbelievably bad. I would recommend Cats if it was that kind of awful but its not. It has some decent production design, some bright spots in the acting and choreography but that can't compensate for a lacking story, uninteresting music, weird CGI and poor characterization. Why isn't being graded as a 1 or a 2? I've seen worse (I'd still say worst of the year Holmes and Watson has it beat) and this movie didn't inspire anger when I watched it, mainly just boredom. I recommend you skip Cats, it belongs in the pantheon of movies that should have everything going for it (acclaimed cast and director, popular source material, big budget effects and production) and just missed the mark. Hopefully those in the production can just put this behind them and move onto other things. I'll remember this movie but not for the laughs, just the disappointment."
1.0,23 December 2019,"Look, is this movie based on the play cats, well yes of course it is, but understand this it only proves that sometimes you should leave a live show exactly that. See I saw the live show a long time ago, it was interesting but very entertaining, I will be honest and say I am not a huge fan but to see it live, the cast in makeup and moving and dancing it was a pure show, they catered to the audience which is what a live show does.... Now the movie, oh boy, the music the dancing is truly there, but it feels empty, the look of the cats is a nightmare or maybe some furry dream who knows, and most of all it has movie edits to make it more purrfect, see what I did there. The live show it moves and dancing is in real time therefore more impressive. Also the actors in the movie are catering to themselves, or as I like to say smelling their own farts and loving it, it's like they are laughing at their own jokes, and we the audience are bored as hell which I was. Look some may like this movie, and they are nuts, but the truth is it is bad like really bad, I wanted to leave but I hate doing that so I suffered till the end of this train wreck. If you want to see cats go to a live show or if you have to see how bad this is wait till it is on a streaming channel, Do NOT pay for this movie....ever. The play has magic and fun, this has crap, crap and more crap plus scared cat like people, who like the smell of their own farts!"
1.0,21 December 2019,I only watched it because I felt I needed to see it to believe how bad it is. I didn't hate it anywhere near as much as I thought I would but it was still pretty terrible. I was going to give it a 4 to try and be slightly positive but I couldn't think of a quality that would be worthy of a 4/10 rating so just stuck with 3. James Corden is the worst. Jason derulo's English accent is almost as bad as don cheadle's in Oceans 11. The graphics looked entirely ridiculous. I just don't know who saw the stage version and thought it would translate well to film. It doesn't. It's also really boring and I tried to power through but left after about an hour. The only positive was the music but I guess the film had nothing to do with that really. James Corden is the worst.
9.0,2 January 2020,"At least Ishtar provided a few laughs... I can't begin to understand the thought process. It's horrid! The biggest problem was the CGI for the fur, ears and tails of the performers. REAL Cats don't look ANYTHING like these creepy beasts. Ears moving randomly and tails looking like awkward phallic objects. Idris Elba doing a soft shoe and singing? Jennifer Hudson NOT SINGING WELL!!! I wish brain bleach could erase this movie from my mind. A horrid, awful mess. Every aspect of this movie was terrible. Survived the cinema experience... barely."
6.0,13 January 2020,"Watching humanoid cats rub up against each other for an entire hour and half was extremely uncomfortable. There was little to no plot, and where there was plot, it was lost in chaos and disgust. There are multiple misplaced silences of heavy breathing and scathing stares. JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME COMEDIANS IN THE MOVIE DOESN'T MEAN IT IS FUNNY. The jokes have poor timing and don't fit with the movie's theme. Also the cats are creepy and their clothing is inconsistent."
1.0,21 December 2019,"If you don't like musicals, then don't see this one. If you're expecting to see the stage version, you'll be disappointed. If one of the actors is a fave of yours, be prepared for something different. All the grumpy critics have already logged in, don't listen to them. They're a bunch of Philistines.

This film should be called ""CATS: The Movie"", because it's very different from the stage show. The re-conception is brilliant. It turns a stubbornly stage musical into a film experience, an achievement that often doesn't go too well. All the elements - dancing, singing, visuals, storytelling - come together beautifully. Every cast member fits the template; it is very much an ensemble piece, not a star turn. Several players whose names you won't recognize (Munkustrap, Shimbleshanks, Mr Mistofelees) just simply dazzle alongside bravura work from the star names.

This is well worth seeing. Don't be put off by the naysayers."
1.0,23 December 2019,"The songs are great, as are the musical numbers. Jennifer Hudson, Jason Derulo, and Taylor Swift all sing and purr-form their rears off.

Only negative was a really creepy Idris Elba, who almost looked like he was going to hang cat dong.

But as i hinted at in the title the film sounds great and has some pretty visuals. It also has some crazy surprises in it that I've never seen in a movie before.

It wasn't a good movie. But then again, Cats isn't technically a good musical either. Its all about the songs and musical numbers. And the performers here all delivered."

9.0,29 December 2019,"Is there a plot? I watched the entire movie and could not find one. The movie is about as exciting as watching a dead cat sleep. I have no idea how this movie got funded, there is no humor, plot, or any entertainment value. Please use the money you'd potentially waste on this movie to a more deserving charity, children in Africa deserve your money more than the excuse of producers who created this movie."
6.0,26 December 2019,I swear to God I'll pistol whip the next person who says Jellicle Cats.
2.0,27 December 2019,I have always loved Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats and loved seeing it come to life on the big screen. The movie follows the musical and has one new song that is a wonderful addition. The dancing in this movie is AMAZING! Judy Dench is fabulous as a cat and Jennifer Hudson steals the show with her rendition of Memory.
1.0,23 December 2019,"Yes, it's weird, I completely agree. Although everything different is not necessarily bad. The CGI makes the actors look alien but kept their familiar faces. I must admit (am I the only one?) that it created a fascinating somewhat creepy attractiveness. The choreography is different from what you have seen before but it fits the cat theme perfectly. If all the critics would answer truthfully, they simply cannot say anything negative about the quality of the dancers. If you have seen the earlier musical version of Cats, you can see the nice parallels they draw. I would give it a 7 if it weren't for the very thin story line and the mediocre singing which almost made me leave after the first 45 minutes of the movie. So, I will eventually rate the movie with a 6. It was entertaining to see something familiar repacked in a weird setting that would fit well in an incoherent dream that I can only describe in this probably incoherent review."
1.0,21 December 2019,Can't believe this came from a director of King's speech. Looks like something Ed Wood would have made if he was alive and got a big budget for a movie. They could have atleast used computer animated house cats instead of those furry nightmares. 1/10

There is no plot to be seen, and I can't believe the cast list signed up to this film because they didn't make it anymore watchable.

1.0,24 December 2019,"I was excited to see this for the music, dance and favorite actors. What a let down this was! I'm shocked that the producers thought this was good. From this time forward I'll wait a month irv2 before paying good $$$ to be a movie."
9.0,25 December 2019,"I very rarely, if ever, leave reviews, but I felt compelled. Sadly, for non-Star wars fans there's little on offer this Christmas. I've fancied seeing Cats at the theatre so what better than to watch the big screen version, finely honed to perfection? Style was of the Polar Express variety, which can work well. The effect was poorly realised. The opening music was a bit rubbish 70's electronic, but I'm a child of the era so the music must get better, right? Sadly not. Surely the music in the stage show isn't so bad is it? I love a good musical.... and this wasn't. James Cordon noted for his lack of acting ability. No surprise there. The actors were heavily made up so hopefully can distance themselves from the whole ordeal and pretend it wasn't themselves playing the part. I was stuck in the middle of an aisle so thought that sleep would save me. Unfortunately the poor music score kept me awake. I had to suffer the dreadfully poor acting and singing. Curiously, some in the audience found humour in some of the lines and were laughing. I can only think that they've seen the stage play, so it's something familiar to them. I could find nothing amusing. I kept waiting for the story music and acting to improve. It didn't. Half way through when I thought all hope was lost, my wife thankfully saved the day and said ""this is awful, can we please go"". The good part is that I have been saved from wasting even more money on theatre tickets."
6.0,28 December 2019,"Worst movie I've seen in 2019 so far and I watched Good Boys. Horrible casting. Horrible choreography. Horrible cinematography and HORRENDOUS CGI. Whatever musical this was based on was a horrible second. Jason Derulo and Rebel Wilson somehow managed to make this gruesome movie even worse than what it already was. If it's not a Disney musical, don't make it. Aladdin was bad enough. Thank you for your time."
2.0,21 December 2019,"Like many, I had read the critics universal panning of this movie and had watched the trailers with much confusion, so with trepidation I decided to chance it.

I'm an avid fan of musicals, both stage & screen, and confess that Cats was never a big favourite, but contained many amazing songs. It always felt disjointed, that it had no plot, and like the poems of TS Elliott had just been stitched together

Well this movie version fixes that. It has a flowing storyline that makes sense, even if getting to the heavyside layer does feel like a feline talent show. The singing is generally awesome with a belter version of Memory, and Beautiful Ghosts fits in with the storyline very well.

If you can get past some dodgy CGI in parts, the close ups are incredible. Yes it's a bit strange to see anthropomorphised cats, but the original stage version was met with derision and it's still pulling in the crowds. So don't be put off by others opinions. Go and decide for yourself"
3.0,21 December 2019,"I can see why people hate it. The CG is awful, it's slow paced and the plot is confusing and weird. But, I went in and had an enjoyable experience. Imagine a generic pantomime with a 'mwa ha ha' villain, kid's jokes and innuendos. Now put a A list cast in, amazing songs and dance numbers. Now film it in a way that makes the audience feel like they're watching a live theatre show. Voila, you have what Cats is. This is an experience that someone like myself and kids would enjoy. But someone looking for a film with a strong character, story and plot will get nothing from this."
1.0,26 December 2019,Proof that Cats do have nine lives. Jelical cats who have three names makes no sense for us lay cat people. Rebel's furry crotch shots made us laugh. Film should have had subtitles so lay cat people could understand what was happening.

1.0,23 December 2019,"So last night for my moms birthday despite the bad reviews we went to see ""cats"" at the cinema. As huge fans of the musical and having seen the stage show we had to see it. Well the reviews are correct, it was horrendous! It bothers me people who havent seen the stage show may now boycott it if they watch this abomination of film. I was concerned that moving from theatre to screen the story may loose its charm.... it lost everything on screen including the audience as some people literally walked out of the cinema. Even the basics were out. Idris Elba played the infamous Macavity... now for those of you unfamiliar in the song Macavity a feral cat and is specifically described s the following :- ginger cat he's very tall and thin eyes are sunken in His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.... They literally sing these lyrics as a beefy sleek brown kitty version of Elba dances around the stage...Wtf! Not to mention the repitching of the songs, poor CGI and inconsistent scale to every day objects ...just to name a few things Absolutely terrible.... I wish I could unsee it I really do. I have come back home and have the immediate urge to watch the recorded version of the stage show just to remind myself how much I lovd it and try to forget the horror that tortured my eyes and ears last night. I've only rated this a 2* as opposed to a 1* as I think very young kids may enjoy it... but that's not a big compliment as that audience still picks their nose and thinks peppa pig is an on screen marvel."
10.0,27 December 2019,Watching this film caused my airway to constrict and my skin to break out in hives. Had to walk out and sneak into the theater showing jumanji instead. $10 better spent on paying someone to punch you in the jaw.

1.0,26 December 2019,"So today I saw the movie. I am a dancer and I works at a Theater. As an artist I have to say that was a pure and so simple movie. I love that there wasn't as much effects as in action movies. I felt like I was in a Theater and watching a play ( I almost clapped). Congratulations to everyone who made that movie! Tha dancers, the choreography were awesome. The song, the voices were fantastic. I know that someone who goes to cinema don't want to see simple things, I think you guys want something amazing, magical and that ""wow"" feeling but that movie is about simpleness, love and dance. You can feel the true love, their hard work and the passion which should lead us in our everyday life. If you don't agree then please don't ignore my comment. Just think about it. And try to love the simple, small things in your life. :)"
1.0,23 December 2019,"So, people think THIS is the WORST movie they've EVER seen? Makes me think these people don't watch many movies. Granted, it is most definitely NOT A CLASSIC. But it's highly original, and mostly entertaining. Not a big fan of ALW or his music; however, this film was not a waste of my time, and I think too many just jump on the anti-Cats bandwagon. Give this movie the modest credit it deserves...if not for anything else but for attempting to make coherence out of a pretty weak stage play. Not gonna be a hater just because it's the trendy thing to be right now. Didn't absolutely love it, but on the whole, it was far from as terrible as most are making it out to be."
2.0,1 January 2020,"It's a musical, so it has dancing and singing, but that's the only thing it has. It's just a waste of time. No humor, no action, no excitement.

I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable as I watched an hour and a half of cats nuzzling each other as their phallic tails moved in disturbing ways. Throughout the whole movie there was this odd sexual tension hanging in the air. The plot was nonexistent, and the whole movie was comprised of cats singing aimlessly about their names. Henceforth, it was crappy, but mildly entertaining."

1.0,22 December 2019,"WHY???? Just Why???? They need to just pull Cats, take the loss, put it on On-Demand or a streaming service (and try to recoup a bit of the astronomical budget), and stop trying to make Cats happen. Saw it and to say it was a HUGE disappointment is an understatement. Outside of Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Dame Judi Dench & Jason Derulo, this film is a complete and utter tragic disaster. It's creepy, disjointed and doesn't have the heart and soul of the musical. The life was sucked right out of it. If you really want to experience the greatness of Cats, go see the musical."
1.0,26 December 2019,"I was skeptical going in to see this movie after reading all of the negative reviews. However, I love the musical so still wanted to give it a try. And I loved it. I thought it was true to the original musical, the singing was great, and the dancing was some of the best I've seen in a film. Yeah, if you go in never having seen the original, and having no idea what to expect, you will hate it. But I think it's a great movie with great performances. It's exactly as weird as it's supposed to be."
1.0,11 April 2020,"If you've seen the Broadway show, you should be prepared by the cats' looks: the performers are constantly in your face in the theater, wherever you're sitting. If you can buy that live, you can buy it on video. Also, I really don't see how people would be unprepared for this to be a full on musical performance. I was surprised by the DIALOGUE: people complaining that they sing all the time, well... duh. That's the whole point. Same goes for the very flimsy plot, as there's actually none. The movie tried to pad it a bit in a way that made very little sense, but the original content was fine as it was. If you want to turn CATS into a movie, that's what you're getting: people pretending to be cats, singing and dancing. It's been more than enough for decades on Broadway and the West End, after all. The only twist that I enjoyed was the fact that they used Victoria as a stand-in for the public, as it made the performance more cohesive.

All in all, as a fan of the show, I really enjoyed this. Far more than I expected. The first half hour strikes some bad cords with a lot of weird choices in sound editing and a really awful rendition of Jennyanydots. I'm not a fan of Rebel Wilson or her typecasting and this was definitely no exception. Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Thankfully, she's the first to disappear and I'm suddenly #TeamMacavity for that. From James Corden on, the movie gets very much back on track with the show, and it's quite a jolly ride. The multiple backgrounds besides the street and the theater don't really work, as the different proportions of humans vs. cats are made glaringly obvious when the characters interact with forniture and trash cans, but that's about my major gripe besides Rebel Wilson. ""Macavity"" is probably one of the best songs and I only realized Bombalurina was Taylor Swift when reading reviews... very sorry for whoever went to the movies for her: great performance, but fans should have done their homework and realize one song was all she got. Dame Judi Dench was, of course, spectacular as usual. I believe she should be cast in ALL menthor/community leader/ultimate boss type of roles, whatever their previous gender. Hell, if they remake Harry Potter in her lifetime, give her Dumbledore, too!!

I'm sold, actually.

But that's probably because I love the show. I know some Broadway fans were underwhelmed by all the changes and that's ok: like books-to-movies, there's bound to be some nitpicking if you're a fan. Unfortunately, I believe that the majority of bad reviews come from people who wouldn't have been the intended audience for the musical and are, therefore, the wrong audience for the movie. Unfortunately, movies are more widespread than Broadway shows, so there'll be a huge chunk of moviegoers who won't be interested."

The Judi Dench monologue at the end made me lose my mind laughing. I saw this stoned on edibles and I can not recommend seeing it any other way. I also recommend at least reading what the musical is about so you don't go into the film assuming it will have a solid plot. An absolutely ridiculous film and the cast is clearly enjoying every minute of the insanity. If you can get past the uncanny valley of the dang animation and just enjoy the ride, you'll have a good time. I cannot say I was bored at any point in the movie.

Anyway, I'm already bored about talking about this complete and utter junk, I'm off now to watch the far superior ""Howling VII: New Moon Rising""."
1.0,13 January 2020,"Cats isn't just bad because of the distractingly bad CGI gaffs. While these did take me out of the film, the film's biggest problem is that it's boring. For such a fantastic approach to its character design, the film is painfully milquetoast. There little cinematic atmosphere and other than basic dramatic lighting. It feels less like a musical and more like a recording of a stage production or a with better costumes.

Other than the weird CGI, the cats themselves are either annoying or forgettable. Francesca Hayward's Victoria maintains the same bewildered look throughout the film. Rebel Wilson and Jeremy Corden's jokes are out of place and seem like a desperate attempt to appeal to a non-musical fans. A highlight is Ian McKellen, who knows to give the material a bit of camp and ham that it needed.

McKellen aside, I had I hopes that this would be a secret so-bad-it's-good gem. Sadly, due to its overall blandness, it doesn't even work on that level."
10.0,29 December 2019,"I have been browsing on IMDB for years but never made an account. I have to, just to write a review for this movie.

As a musical fan and a singer myself, Cats is my favorite musical of all time. I love the characters, the songs and even the story. I used to watch the DVD at least once per week when I was small. This is how much I love Cats.

Bad cinematography. Weird dancing sequences, though there are certain parts that are kind of good. Most of the characters have terrible acting. And the singing and the songs! Oh my, I still can't apprehend how they can butcher them so much. With a musical this great, you really have to be doing SOMETHING to make it so bad. Seriously, how can they butcher the song of Mungojerrie And Rumpelteazer like this? What were they thinking? I really have no idea.

My girlfriend wanted to leave the theatre after this song, and it was her first time wanting to leave during movie. But we did not. Maybe the movie was going to be better, right? No, it just got worse.

The only one who could sing in this whole movie, was Jennifer Hudson. Maybe Francesca Hayward as well. The other actors either were very boring and uninspiring, or simply lack the talent or training for singing. And the mixing was pretty bad as well. The music was always too loud, while the vocals were all too compressed and thus sounded very small, even for Jennifer Hudson.

If only the story is better, Cats can be a better movie. But no. I appreciate they were trying to make something different, but different does not mean better. In the case for this story, many changes were for the worse. Macavity was a very plain villain, and was almost silly at times. There were background information thrown into the story, like Grizabella became who she was now because she had ran away with Macavity. But these elements were never explored in the movie.

Instead, the plots were just too fast and too shallow. Most characters were not explored properly, while some were given too much screen time for no reason. The only plot which moved me a little was the interaction between Victoria and Grizabella. Apart from some touchy scenes, there was no tension in the story.

Therefore, I have come to a conclusion: the whole purpose of this movie was to make us like and appreciate the broadway show more."

It is disappointing to see the bad reviews and some of the actors bad mouthing the movie because of its reviews. The reviews about the CGI and the fact they have normal hands make no sense...I'm not sure what they expected....paws?? (Which were not in the theatre production)

It's a great portrayal of the theatrical show! Watch with the mindset of going to the theatre rather than watching a film."
1.0,29 February 2024,"I avoided this movie due to everyone's unanimous statements that it was terrible. And I'm not saying it's the movie of the year or anything. There were a couple of odd points with the CGI, and the roach scene was definitely... a choice.

But, watching it with my kids, it was overall a fun romp. I liked the plot additions instead of just being a collection of character songs, and the choice to have a pov character being introduced to everyone right along with us.

Really, if you take it for what it is - a silly story about magical cats who sing and dance - instead of what it could have been - a star studded musical extravaganza- it's quite enjoyable."

1.0,3 January 2020,I needed to be drunk or high watching this. Worst movie of the decade.
1.0,20 December 2019,"Tom Hooper, best known for his Oscar-winning film version of the smash hit musical 'Les Misérables', has made an oddly mesmerising big screen version of Andrew Lloyd Webber's well known stage musical 'Cats'. With actors fully covered in what was supposed to look like realistic CGI-fur, its paper thin story and horrifying visuals are tonally and visually messy, to the extent of either disgusting you or push you into a frenzy of uncontrollable laughter.

Each year, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles must decide which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life. Just thrown out of a car by her human, Victoria is the newest cat in town who is basically our eyes and ears through this strange and peculiar ceremony, that'll drag us through the streets of London.

Cats is surprisingly not a boring film, to which you'll notice your eyes being glued to the screen for the full runtime. Burned into your cornea, cats with human features, jazz dancing human-hybrid cockroaches and the unzipping of furs as some sort of costume change mid-performance, will make this the most bizarre moviegoing experience of the decade, if not the century. David Cronenberg couldn't come up with something as cooked as this.

With a grand range of mostly well known actors and dancers, the creators try to reach a broad audience of cinema goers that might not be familiar with the musical itself. Ballerina Francesca Hayward, making her on screen debut as pearly white kitten Victoria doesn't get a lot of lines, but impresses with her ongoing dance routines in which she literally floats (the visual effects looked so unfinished, you can notice a visible gap between their feet and the computer generated floor) through every scene. Oscar-winning actress/singer Jennifer Hudson plays glamour cat Grizabella, who's made some wrong decisions in the past and ended up as a sad and lonely stray carrying her wealth and fortune with her, hoping she gets to sing her song to impress the Jellicles, and fit in once again. Hudson, who's fur looked surprisingly combed, gets to perform the best known song on the soundtrack 'Memory' and so saves her own career by proving she's actually better than this. One can only hope this boosts her career like Dreamgirls once did for her.

What's utterly frightening, is the fact all these other actors are giving it their all, making it even more of an out-of-body experience. Judi Dench breaking the fourth wall, by bringing a monologue to the audience in how to address a cat, will for sure make the entire audience crack up in roaring laughter. Rebel Wilson does what Rebel Wilson does, while R&B-singer Jason Derulo tries a British accent, and fails. Recently anointed ""performer of the decade"" Taylor Swift's part is narratively useless, especially when her character completely disappears from the stage, without any explanation.

Of course the songs and music are as odd as the musical itself, with some weird synthesiser tune as part of the main theme. But one can't deny some of the songs are joyfully upbeat and catchy. Unfortunately, these songs are almost identical to the stage musical versions and aren't done justice by actors who can't really sing. Accompanied by some great production design, some acts look truly spectacular - such as a bedroom and dining room scene in which everything is larger than life. But Hooper thought bigger is better and destroys almost every scene with the overuse of bad-CGI, blurring what should look crisp and fighting Disney's ""live action"" version of The Lion King for the award of biggest cat-astrophe. Cats is claw-fully ambitious and doesn't kitten around. This tail of forgiveness and redemption had lots of paw-sibilities, but un-fur-tunately is nothing more than a hiss-terical fail of incomprehensible proportions."
3.0,22 December 2019,"I'm not sure it would have been possible to make a great movie of Cats, but even so, this is a poor adaptation that dispenses with all the things that made the stage show popular. The amazing costumes and striking feline make-up of the original are replaced by distracting and excessive CGI that's somehow less convincing, the poor musical arrangements and instrumentation mean the songs sound much cheaper and tinnier than they should (how is it possible that this sounds more 80s than the 80s version?), while several of the roles normally played by seasoned musical theater performers are here filled by non-singers and non-dancers, meaning that some songs are spoken instead of sung (to their detriment). Taylor Swift and Jennifer Hudson are good, and it's their respective segments that comes closest to capturing the vibe this film should have had. Also fine are Ian McKellen and James Corden (who seems to realise he's in a bad film), as well as the central trio of Francesca Hayward, Robbie Fairchild and (especially) Laurie Davidson, even if they don't have much to do. Jason Derulo's take on Rum Tum Tugger unexpectedly falls flat, and it's not his fault - I wanted to see a fully-unleashed Derulo version of the character, but the arrangement and choreography are so tepid that Derulo has little leeway to show off. Cats is a dance-based spectacle, but the CGI overkill turns what should have been a theater piece into a cartoon.

The inconsistent proportions didn't bother me at first... until I got to the railway scene where the cats are suddenly the size of shrews. And J-Hud's ascension into the cosmos should have been profound and moving, but ended up laughable. The stage musical isn't strong on narrative and characterization, but it has edge, sass and an artful 80s-rock sensibility that's totally missing here. While the stage show has energy to spare, this just feels listless - and there's no good reason why it should. It's not entertaining or fun, and never gives the audience a reason to care."

8.0,23 December 2019,"So like everyone in the world I saw the trailer for this and was turned off by the creepy motion capture effects. I came into this thinking it was going to be a one. I would like to think a little positive of the film. I've seen the original stage production in my childhood long ago and from what I see here they tried their best to adapt as much as possible of that stage onto the screen. So the true question is, should you adapted something like Cats? The stage play is basically a series of songs strung together that make a solid story, and are fully met for broadway actors to do interpretive dance numbers to. If you are into that sort of thing than you may like Cats. The musical numbers are a lot better than the ones in the movie adaption of Le Mes( Le Mes way far superior however)but that's because everyone here can sing. Except Idris Alba. This role was a total mistake for this dude. His whole objective was as an add on character to make sure the story acts like a movie. The only performer who really did this well was James Corbin. He was a funny a charming and for me a tongue and check persona that let me know that even the filmmakers thought this was ridiculous (In my head anyway). The CGI was not all there. Felt like they were trying to creep me out vs. getting it down packed. Anyway, not that big a fan of musicals and this is that in every way. If you saw Cats on broadway take the risk you might like it. If you haven't, I know there is at least an Australian production of the stage musical released on DVD that you might want to track down rather than watching this."
6.0,26 December 2019,"People have been overcritisicing this movie like if all movies need to leave a legacy for humanity. You can simpliy go, enjoy the music and disconnect. Nothing in the movie is real (like Star Wars either) so stop criticising the human-looking cats. Jennifer Hudson's interpretation is outstanding and the cast of singers and dancers do a great job. Francesca Hayward is lovely as Victorìa. James Corden however, looked a bit disconnected from the character and was two much James Corden. The story goes fine until we have seen about 40% of it and goes down, turning too slow, then it manages to recover to have a decent second part. I don't regret it. Maybe it's because I like musicals."

I loved the movie. And proud of the actors who were creative enough to take a chance at being a cat.

The dancing was tight and I had to watch numerous times so I could see all of the performers.

Open your eyes people and give credit where it's due. CATS THE MOVIE WAS ENCHANTINGLY FUN!

Don't pay attention to the negative reviews because they miss the point."

1.0,20 December 2019,"Forget the critics - based upon T.S.Elliots classic poems in Old Possums Book Of Practical Cats and the musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, Cats is a genuine treat. It stays fairly faithful to the musical and includes the gorgeous music that made Cats so iconic. A little dodgy CGI in a few places but that doesn't detract from the story being told. Jennifer Hudson shines as Grizabella and Judi Dench makes a great Old Deuteronomy. Francesca Hayward's debut is fantastic too and she showcases her balletic talent in some well choreographed numbers. Overall I thought it was really quite great and as a fan of the poems and musical I was not disappointed."

1.0,24 December 2019,I had no idea what was going on the whole time. The story line made no sense and it was honestly difficult to watch. The film was way too long even for a good film so the fact it was absolutely awful made it unbearable. This film had so much potential to be good especially due to the famous cast but it ended it up being so bad. I do not recommend this film at all!

10.0,13 January 2020,"But oh my GOD was this a pointless movie! It's 2 hours of poorly animated cats dancing and singing as a way to introduce themselves, all as a ploy to move onto the ""Heavylayer side"" which is appointed by the Deuteronomy (Judi Dench).

Music was unmemorable (though ""Memory"" is quite decent, props to Jennifer Hudson for that), the choreography was nice and there were some pretty shots. But it doesn't make up for the fact that the storyline is pointless, the conflict was basically non-existent, and the humour is just so unfunny thanks to James Corden (though that is probably me being bias because I just can't stand the man) and Rebel Wilson, who has not played a different character since being introduced to the big screen, and her trope of ""Oh I fall over a lot and it's funny because I'm fat"" is so overdone it just makes me angry. I pray that she will actually do something different with her roles in the future or she may never be able to get out of that increasingly deeper hole.

I know this has all been said before, but I got so mad at this movie that I feel it needed to be said again"

2.0,23 December 2019,"I really wanted to like the movie CATS and prove all of the other reviews wrong. Sadly, from a media perspective this film neglects to introduce character's backstories and their reasons for the dispute they have against each other. It also fails to follow Todorov's narrative theory - the villain does not get his comeuppance and therefore there is no real cathartic ending, instead in my opinion, the film leaves you empty, confused and angry that 2 hours and high expectations have been wasted. Taylor swift is also in it for a total of about 4 minutes and therefore should not be the face of this movie. The CGI is not up to scratch with the cats paws not actually touching the floor looking like they are floating throughout the movie."
2.0,22 December 2019,"I don't think the movie is deserving all these negative reviews. It does what it's supposed to do. The original musical never had a concrete storyline, in fact this has a clearer storyline to it with it's added dialogue.

In terms of the way they look, Andrew Lloyd Webber never wanted it to look like a cartoon kiddy animation, that was his view when they released the first film version, It's a stage musical with humans made up to look like cats so the film again does that but they've used new technologies.

Music is just as great, only issue was the version they used for Mungojerrie and Rumpelteaser song, I preferred the song layout that was in the first film version.

Altogether a great, fun film."

I watched the 1998 version at home the night after seeing this new version in the theater..and honestly, they were like exactly the same. Maybe I saw the re-released version where they fixed the CGI issues, but this movie just looked like any other movie. It was no where near as awful as the reviews would lead you to believe."

1.0,1 January 2020,The basic problem with Cats is that the piece is conceptual. It's a theatrical extravaganza that utilised dance and song to be a celebration of the form and feel of live theatre. Hopper (as with the ever do lacklustre Les Miserables) shows that he is a workmanlike director with no particular vision. His default seems to be point the camera and crew and hope for the best. They can work when you have Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush but CATS needed a concept that celebrates the movie musical just in the same way the West End and Broadway versions celebrated the live musical experience. It is an epic failure of vision and artistry from the director that kills this project dead.
1.0,28 December 2020,"I've seen the stage show twice in London, got the DVD of the original cast doing it and have the songs in my music library. If you like the original show this is not quite as good, I think the attempts at adding humour and plot fall a bit flat, and some of the effects detract from the performances rather than add to them. But as a film adaptation of a musical it's a lot better attempt than Les Miserables and if you take as a musical celebration of the original poems then it's pretty good."
1.0,22 December 2019,"I rated Cats (2019) 2/10 #IMDb

This... this was extremely rough to get through. The way the cats looked was very disturbing. The CGI was very rough and there are whole scenes that are very cheaply done. The songs sung for a majority of this weren't delivered well as well as hard to listen to, which isn't the actors fault since most of them are not singers. The one song I was very skeptical and nervous about was Memories. I was very happy to see that it wasn't as atrocious as the trailer made it seem. It was delivered well. Then there is the story, if you are not familiar with the play then I believe you would have a hard time following along. Even tho I am familiar with the play, I still had a hard time following along with this. There were just random things that didn't help with the flow of the story I felt. Which isn't good when those random things were actually supposed to help make it flow better.

Did I mention how creepy the cat-people looked? Honestly this might be the holy grail for people who identify as ""furries""...

Now with a director (Tom Hooper) who has done musicals before and has some very highly praised films under his belt, Les Miserables (2012) The Danish Girl (2015) The Kong's Speech (2010) John Adams (2008, miniseries) Elizabeth I (2005, miniseries), this should have been so much better. This is a hard play to do in the first place, but we have seen his work and skill. This is trash sadly. Then there is a A-list cast. This had a little potential of being at least a decent film, not great but decent. but it was really really poorly done...

If you know me and how I rate/review films, I am sometimes to ""forgiving"" when if comes to something I'm not a fan of. Sometimes I am to generous with how I rate things. I try hard to look at every aspect of what it takes to make a film. I pay attention to the work of the actors in the film, what the director has done before, what is going on in the life of the director and actors that might give a film a certain leaning, I even look at what is going on in the world that might sway a film. Among other things. I did all that for this film and I can't find a excuse for why it was so poorly done. That is my take on Cats (2019). You might completely disagree or completely agree with me."
1.0,4 January 2020,"To make a movie that is ""so bad it's good"" is like walking a knife's edge. It can't be intentional, and it has to be so mind-bendingly weird that it becomes almost sublime. I have to say, Cats accomplishes this. It is rare that each element of a movie works harmoniously to make something so confounding. I am giving this movie a low rating because, objectively, it is really very bad. But I am also encouraging you to go out and see this movie, because it is unquestionably entertaining.

The CGI has somehow produced feline-oids that simultaneously appear too realistic and hilariously cartoonish, and the net result can only be described as the mind full on rejecting everything that is being perceived. Andrew Lloyd Weber's score has received some updates, though in none of the ways it perhaps should, and the result is (somehow) simultaneously dated but with a cloying modern sheen. The acting swings from laughably austere to hammy. The feline-oids change size and scale dizzyingly and at random. Ian McKellan's participation in this picture might qualify as elder abuse. And Dame Judi Dench (!) must be seen to be believed.

This is all only the tip of the iceberg- the rest defies description. You really must see this movie, it is unlikely there shall ever be anything quite like it again."
9.0,7 January 2020,"Ahh...where to start. The first half somehow manages to be extremely disturbing, nightmarish and tedious all at once. The second half is less tedious, not so nightmarish, but still disturbing. There is an excessive amount of writhing. The mice are somehow more disturbing than the cats, and don't get me started with the cockroaches.

Human hands on cats look wrong. Human feet on cats look wrong. Human eyes and noses on cats look very very wrong. We liked the little cat ears; they were cute. Tails have a life of their own.

Of the cats, Mr. Mistoffelees and Old Deuteronomy were our favourites. Judy Dench somehow manages to remain regal in the face of all those cat bums and writhing tails.

Gus the Theatre Cat proves that Gandalf is an animagus. Just not a very good one.

To sum up, it was an experience and I'm not sure that the kids and I will ever be quite the same again. Andrew Lloyd Webber has a lot to answer for. Poor old TS Eliot is creating a black hole from spinning in his grave.

To further sum up, if you don't want to be simultaneously bored and terrified, I recommend you give the movie a miss and read Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats instead."
7.0,27 September 2020,"This movie made me felt bored. It's only like singing all the time and that's made me feel sleepy. Then the CGI, it so... I can't even describe it with words, sometimes the cats it's looks creepy

Watching this movie feels like watching an opera with a boring story, the cockroaches was really really bad, oh my god what I just watch it just waste my time.

But there's a song that stuck in my head that was why I gave a 2/10 not 1/10 cause that one song, the acting when they act like cat was really really cringe and that was really really creepy, all creature in this movie was so creepy."
3.0,7 January 2020,"Let me just say there was nothing wrong with the performances. Francesca Hayward was absolutely stunning! She reminds me of Chiana from Farscape! She's so expressive I can't believe she hasn't done more acting not counting the ballet performances she has under her belt.. And Jennifer Hudson just about brought tears to my eyes when she sang ""Memories""!

The biggest letdown was the instrumental score especially at the beginning. It was ODD. I've never seen the play so maybe that was the original score IDK. Anyway, this move lacked everything that made The Greatest Showman great, which absolutely blew me away. It just didn't flow at all.I fell asleep after 30 minutes and woke up just in time for the escape scene on the boat. I loved the ending mostly due to Jennifer Hudson's performance. But as a whole it just didn't feel like a solid movie to me.

One more note, as Trevor Noah pointed out, why does Macavity have a fur coat on? Cats already have a fur (well, hair) coat!"
3.0,16 September 2020,"My roommates and I saw this in an otherwise empty theatre on January 1st 2020. I have thus become convinced that In doing so we broke the matrix and accidentally unleashed a monstrous curse upon the year 2020.

I often ask myself, was it worth it? A deadly virus, the most divisive political race in history, wildfires, hurricanes, unending isolation and millions out of work. All because my roommates and I just HAD to see this trash heap of a movie. Could it have been avoided if we had just gone to see Jumanji 2? I guess we'll never know.

What I DO know is that there is nothing remotely redeeming in this movie. The music (excluding Memory) is a grating mix of discordant leitmotifs and demonic-sounding chants. The visuals are a massively uncomfortable crawl through the Uncanny valley. Talented actors (Judi Dench, Ian MacKellan, Idris Elba) are forced to meow, mewl and hiss their way through the poorest excuse for a plot I've ever witnessed. The set design bears no semblance of a consistent scale (one seconds the cats are small enough to tap dance on a train track, while earlier they're as tall as gravestones). And the CGI becomes so distractingly horrific that I was convinced someone spiked my large coke with multiple tabs of acid.

Avoid this movie at all costs. It's too late for me, but I'd just one person reads this review and heeds my warning, it'll all be worth it. I stared into the void that cold day in January, and the void stared back. But you can still be spared.

Make the right choice. Watch Jumanji 2 instead."

It wasn't a great movie but it certainly doesn't warrant the level of vitriol that other reviewers have posted. I saw the Broadway show many years ago and I don't see why the comparisons to it are so negative. Also, I find many of the negative reviews have a similar tone and verbiage, as though they were written by a bunch of people sitting around brainstorming to see who could top each other with their insults of the movie. I actually liked the sets and costumes. I loved Dame Judy Dench as Deuteronomy and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus, the Theatre Cat. And Jennifer Hudson outdid herself once again.

1.0,5 November 2023,
9.0,24 August 2021,"Well, I finally ignored the bad reviews and sat through this, and what can I say about it? Well, it at least improves over the play. Yeah, the CGI was a disaster, there's no getting around that; they tried something, and it didn't work, and unfortunately, most people can't seem to see beyond that. But the movie and story itself, an improvement in every way. First, it actually has a bit of a story. The original play, it was basically one cat after another appearing and singing about their one defining feature, and that's it. This, while it does that too, at least expands on things and gives more characters actual character rather than being a one song appearance character.

The story and character of Victoria and Mistoffelees are really expanded upon, especially Victoria, who is now the main character, as is their relationship, and Macavity and Grizabella a little bit too, giving more depth to their character and investing you in them and their interest a little more rather than them just appearing for a single song and dance, and then they no longer matter. Instead, they actually take part of the plot and the overall story and have more to do with things, especially Victoria, who even gets her own song and helps out Grizabella instead of just being another background character. For example, instead of Mistoffelees' song just being an introduction for and about his character, the scene is given more depth where he's trying to gain his confidence to save the day while the others support and encourage him. It also introduced him earlier and established he was magical back then rather than have him be a deus ex machina like in the stage musical. Little details like this go a long way. They actually do the ""show, don't tell"" rule for all of the characters to show what they're like rather than the play that only sings what they're like and doesn't show it.

Of course, overall the movie still isn't much of a story, but at least it's an actual story instead of one random song and dance strung together by another for something that pretends to be a story like the wayt the actual musical was, so it feels like there's actual some kind of stakes or plot to follow. When it comes down to it, story and characterization plays the biggest part of a movie, and this at least has that with some of the characters, which the play doesn't (excluding Grizabella). In the original, the only character you really feel anything for is Grizabella, but in this one, you can feel at least a little bit for some of the other characters, which is an improvement over the play.

Obviously, the movie was still a flop, and the CGI did not work out, but if you compare it to the original, it improves over it in almost every way, which is at least some kind of win. Not that I'll be watching either of them again, but I'll take this over the original any day."
7.0,18 October 2020,"I watched from a Broadway musical point of view. I watched this so hard trying to enjoy their characters. The cat/human bodies took away whatever story telling there was. Why not completely animate? Ugh, this was actually really terrifying."

1.0,31 December 2019,"What is with Hollywood's obsession of CGI? The human-cat hybrids with their superimposed uncanny human features and shaking cat are disturbing to watch. They even managed to make Idris Elba look unattractive which I did not think was possible. If that wasn't enough, they had to throw in some singing humanoid rats and cockroaches to make your skin crawl.

The only redeeming musical performance was Jennifer Hudson's rendition of ""Memory."" The rest of the songs sounded bland and boring because they restricted the vocal talents of the singers who can actual sing. They neutered Rum Tum Tugger and cut Demeter from ""Macavity"" so Bombalurina (Taylor Swift) sounds like she's singing to herself. They also ruined their whole dynamic, practically removing Demeter from the movie.

No.

I can't do that here. This is really bad. I - can't put it into words. Just - everything about this cries - weird. And not interesting weird or even cult weird - just - bad. Like the bleating of a lamb. Baa-aaa-aaad.

I can't possibly spoil the story for you as sadly there is no story. Not really.

Okay maybe I can find something. Remember how kooky it was in Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life - you remember those fish with the human faces ? John Cleese as a fish.

Well there you go. Now imagine that put onto bad CGI anthropomorphic cats - and throughout the whole film. It's not CGI. It's not costume. It's just ugly what they did here. It's nasty. It's not at all pleasant to look at.

If it were costumes and furry stuff like the original play, yeah, that's okay, but no, they took it a step further and a step too far ... goes beyond weird it's just - wrong in every possible way.

So don't see it like I did. Don't see the preview. If this is all you ever find out about this film is my review, count yourself lucky and go see a good Cirque Du Soleil instead. You'll thank me later.

this movie is a total waste of resources."
1.0,13 August 2020,"Apparently I watched something different than the other reviewers. I love the stage musical. This was a fun, star filled cast adaptation of the theatre production. Well done and creative with lots of cat antics and quirky touches to the different applicants."
1.0,27 December 2019,"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes, Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. TS Eliot, The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock

Though these lines are not from Eliot's cat-naming Old Possum poem, they do reflect his cat preference as the inspiration of Andrew Lloyd Weber's Cats, now on film. Writer/director Tom Hooper's visuals capture the languid London of the story while the actors cannily imitate the sensuous personas of the notoriously enigmatic and elusive animal.

Knowing that Eliot could not have envisioned a musical version of his whimsical poem, much less on film, it's not surprising that the musical remains even on film a mess of motifs and a thin story line. Add to that fuzzy CGI costumes and indistinct London backgrounds, it's a critically-panned production that maybe couldn't have been saved even with the magic of modern technology.

Lead Francesca Hayward as Victoria is a magnetic ballerina and face, while Dame Judy Dench comes off quite well underplaying Old Deuteronomy, an ancient feline making the momentous annual decision about who will be the pre-eminent jellicle cat. Ian McKellen as always steals his scenes, this time as Gus the Theater Cat, who appropriately laments the loss of great theater. Any cat proclaiming from London, the seat of superior theater, has the right to complain.

Although there's probably more dancing than in Westside Story, the writing is not half as good. To use clichés like ""Look what the cat dragged in! and ""Cat got your tongue?"" is to seriously undermine the spirit of a pre-eminent 20th-century poet. No screenplay Oscar for this musical.

Of course, the play and film count on the blockbusting ""Memory,"" sung here by a soulful Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson). Taylor Swift sings an ok ballad for her almost cameo appearance. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees is a pop-like confection that nevertheless allows actors to show their chops while giving the audience another tune to hum on their way out.

Although themes of happiness coming from self-awareness and memory play throughout to unify the discursive story, Idris Elba's bad-boy Macavity is just not bad enough to lend gravity. Busy sets and sometimes lyrical song and dance can't redeem an otherwise flaccid story.

If for only one of my favorite poets, I wish this play had more than one weak life, but maybe with eight more possibilities it will be worthy of Eliot and Hooper."

2.0,26 December 2019,"The worst dumpster fire of a movie I've ever seen in theaters. Not even National Treasure Dame Judi Dench could save this film from the stain it has put upon the world. My friend and I went knowing it would be bad so we had a few drinks before. Not even my 3 glasses of wine could delude me into thinking it's a good film. The CGI was a joke, the special effects laughable, the acting was terrible and over the top (I expect this was the doing of Tom Hooper) and to top it all off every chorus had stray notes and no cohesive harmony. Nothing about this film was salvageable, a total wreck. EVERY MOMENT WAS CRINGEWORTHY! I literally cringed ON my cringes! What baffles me is that there were about 50 other viewers in the audience and no one walked out, no one shouted at the screen about how bad it was, no one besides us even cackled at the absurdity of the whole stanky mess."
1.0,28 December 2019,"So cats....lets talk about this thing and waste even more of my time with writing this and yours by riding it,but since i wasted part of my life by watching it lets go,cats is one of biggest failures of entire year and that means in every single way possible,lets admit it what can we espect from a film that doesnt have plot,and entire cgi and visual effects are really hard and disturbing to look at,hell i felt sorry for actors like dench and mckellen to be in this but it was their decision they choose for whatever reason probably money,cats is proof that stage musicals dont work in films and it is wasting everyone time and patience with its existance"
3.0,29 December 2019,"This is the worst example of it.

Plus they changed the original coreography and the characters list is not complete.

Apparently a cat hater's worst nightmare on screen."
1.0,23 December 2019,How can someone waste a whole budget to make such a horrible move in 90 percent of the aspects? Why don't you respect the audience?!!! It was a while that I didn't watch such a racist and awful movie. Shame. Waste of my money and time.

1.0,21 December 2019,"Well,. here goes.. CATS:The Movie,.It's certainly an experience unlike any other... Is that a good thing?,. I'd say (against ALL odds) Yes!. The show is basically 'an experience' no discernible plot,. a group of poems put to music and sung/danced as a burlesque of show numbers,. crowd claps,. goes home happy. What the director has done with the movie,. is linked together a narrative that tries to link (slightly) all of those elements from the show.. It LOOKS stunning,. from the first glimpse of the humanoid cats dodging car lights in a gloriously colourful version of London in neon. What the movie press have jumped on is the first trailer bandwagon (which wasn't good) and all the negative press,. ""let's sink this puss"".. without looking at the content.. The CONTENT IS CATS! Once you acclimatise to the look of the characters, (which have been improved since that first trailer), it's no more or less fantastical than AVATAR was. The lead three characters are wonderful together and each character song is performed and staged with glee and aplomb,. (Even James Cordon is bearable) Highlights for me are the new song (Beautiful Ghosts),. OLD DEUTERONMY introduces the character beautifully (Judi Dench and Ian McKellen almost steal the film),.SKIMBLESHANKS: The Railway Cat is a Tap dancing highlight,. MEMORY may not work as a listen too version on record but it plays beautifully in the film and Jennifer Hudson was so touching. Taylor Swift and Rebel Wilson all deliver in their Burlesque/humour moments. My biggest niggle was that the scale falters with Mungojerry and Rumpleteaser dancing with the lead where a ring or a necklace suddenly reduce the cats to mouse size. Seeing I never liked the show but appreciated it.., I can happily say I preferred the film and I LIKED it (the cinema was also packed!) If you can tolerate the far fetched antics and computer generated folderol of THE GREATEST SHOWMAN,. then two minutes in,. you should acclimatise to CATS,. Ignore the bad reviews.. make up your own mind for me today it was a Christmas treat!"
1.0,21 December 2019,I don't know what to say...i hated it and i'm now scarred for life.
9.0,23 December 2019,"Although the CGI and costume design was insanely creepy, the actors did a fabulous job. Francesca is an amazing dancer and her training clearly shines! I was a little disgusted by Rebel Wilson's opening scene, but she had a small roll and gave a comedic air that was needed. James Corden also helped bring humor to a much needed dragging storyline. Jennifer Hudson absolutely owned her character. When she sang Memories at the end we all had tears. What a powerful voice! Dame Judi Dench was a joy. Her ending monolog kept us giggling as cat owners. Idris Elba has such a hypnotic yet creepy voice in this, however, I could not stand how he looked in full character. The CGI was off which leads to what brings this movie down. The horrible character design. What the heck are they supposed to be?? I know they were meant to be cats, but looked like a weird cat/human hybrid or just some crazy furries who might be a little too into it. I heard the original idea was to make this movie an animation and they should have stuck to that idea. My kids were cracking up at the fact the characters were in a body suit with cat patterns, cat ears, yet had human hands and feet. At one point my son loudly laughed and said ""hands"" when one of the characters held up an item. Why do not full cat costume? That would have looked better than the body suit, CGI ears and tails, and fur coats. Again, I can't fault the actors for such a poor plotline and bad costume design. They owned their characters beautifully. Everything else about the movie though was very poorly done. Honestly, if you read this before purchasing tickets I would recommend holding off. I wish we had just saved our money and watched it when it came out on cable."
6.0,6 January 2020,"I've never seen a movie like this. And maybe it's for the best. Calling 'Cats' a movie maybe too much. Usually movies have a narrative, a story, some kind of construct. But not here. Here you'll only get nightmarish scenes which barely tie together, served with nonsensical music which isn't even that good, and special effects that aren't finished, and would propably look horrendous even when done. Only good thing here is the choreography, dancing and playful movement was a joy, ruined by the fur covering it all. Amazing. Never again. How can something like this even be made?"
1.0,6 January 2020,"I went to the theater thinking this would be one of those so bad it's good movies, and worst comes to worst it has good actors and the music is the same as the stage production which ran on broadway for ages. They had the choreographer from Hamilton, and Tom Hooper's last musical movie wasn't so bad. How bad can this movie be? The answer is BAD. Everything about this movie is bad. Aside from the obvious, cats that look like video game CGI deepfaked on, everything feels like your inside a bad CGI fever dream. The music is just terrible, and the few times it is good is just a huge relief after you just heard whatever you call what Rebel Wilson just did. And don't even get me started on the plot. Or how the actors are basically just floating heads they suck on the Cats just so they could sell more tickets. But I could go on forever and to be honest the only reason I'm wasting my time writing this is too save you from wasting your time. Don't see this movie."
1.0,31 December 2019,Boring. Could not figure out story until the very last few minutes.
3.0,6 January 2020,"I cringed this whole movie. I felt freaked out, nauseated, and I just wanted to run out of the theatre. I paid seven dollars, and I would rather have spent that seven dollars removing my ear drums that listening to this horrid music. Please don't watch this, not even ironically."
1.0,30 March 2020,"I almost feel like this movie is some cruel joke. there's no need to even really review it. this movie a waste of time, money, talent; everything. it will just depress you at how desperate hollywood is for a cash grab, and how they think we're all mindless consumers.

this movie had one good thing, it made me realize we should be demanding better movies, it's our money we're spending and this is what they expect us to purchase?"
2.0,8 January 2020,
2.0,21 December 2019,"I'm not sure what everyone else went to see when they saw Cats, but I saw a modern update of the beautiful Broadway show. And trust me you will see some differences but that's what Hollywood does. For those who go to see this with an open mind you're not going to be disappointed, and Jennifer Hudson's performance of Memory will break your heart."
1.0,21 December 2019,"Despite all the paw-wringing, we found much to pass a pleasant afternoon with a furry fairy tale. The attention to detail with the signage was intriguing. If you like dancing and singing and aren't concerned with complicated dialogue, hey! we've seen much worse. Ian McKellan knows how to act. Even like a cat."
2.0,18 March 2020,"I'm not sure what rocket scientist said, ""Hey, let's make a movie based on the Musical Cats!"" - but that person should be banned from any form of production for the rest of their lives.

In a word......... TERRIBLE.

Don't waste your time."
10.0,7 January 2020,"Cats is the musical phenomenon of the year. Unfortunately, the year is 1981. So the first 'proper' film version feels like something of a latecomer to the Jellicle Ball.

Now don't get me wrong, I loved the stage show. It was my first taste of West End theatre and the sight of a cast of singers and dancers dressed as cats and let loose in a playground of oversized junk was quite a spectacle. I bought the t-shirt. I got the soundtrack. I learned the songs. I accepted it for what it was. I was 9 years old.

So I approach the film version of 'Cats' as somebody who knows the music, the poetry and the characters really well. I have a certain nostalgic fondness for the piece and really can't comprehend what somebody would have thought of this entertainment had this been their first experience of the show.

The story in 'Cats' doesn't really exist. The screenplay even alludes to this when the 'Jellicle choice' is being explained to the baffled audience: 'Each cat gets up and sings their song and tells us about their character and then Deuteronomy decides who deserves to be reborn' setting up some kind of school talent show with added reincarnation scenario. The writers soon run out of links to the next musical item though, indeed one of them is merely introduced with the horrible line 'right, shall we see the next contestant?', like they'd actually given up thinking of something interesting for the cats to say. The Jellicle choice is not exactly a great surprise to anybody either. Will it be the fat cat? Or the pesky thieves? Or the one who does magic? Or could it be the really downtrodden one who's fallen from grace and needs a bit of a lift? Judges, it's over to you.

Those who mocked the trailer picked up on the scaling of the cats vs the backgrounds (which didn't bother me), on the substandard CGI (which is shoddy to say the least) and on the surreal physical appearance of the felines (which I actually found quite endearing, especially when their little ears moved in time with the music). My issues with the film were more about the performances, the music, the singing and the editing rather than the funny tails.

A few performers come through with their reputations intact. Jennifer Hudson gives an emotional rendition of 'Memory' (which always surprises me by being a better song than I want it to be) and Robbie Fairchild is likable as Munkastrap. The Royal Ballet's Francesca Hayward is very watchable as she prances around and interacts with the other cats. Elsewhere there are a few poor fits and a couple of absolute howlers. Ian McKellen looks lost as he talks his way through 'Gus, The Theatre Cat', Taylor Swift is hardly used in her role as Bombalurina and Ray Winstone introduces himself as Growltiger and sings half a verse of his song before disappearing (presumably the rest of the number was cut). Judi Dench has one of the film's most awkward moments when, during the finale number, she begins to move up the scale to build the song before suddenly leaping down an octave to a note she can sing. I don't understand why it wasn't put in the right key for her (or why they didn't cast an actor who could sing it...) In terms of the most irritating performance, it's hard to choose between James Corden and Rebel Wilson. Both need to realise that gurning in front of the camera and then falling over does not equal comic relief. In fact, all of the attempts at humour in the film fall completely flat.

Some of the music remains intact from the original soundtrack, including the Moogy synths of the overture. The arrangements have often been changed, and I wouldn't have a problem with this but they are usually worse than the original orchestrations. The standout success is the Skimbleshanks number which manages to present a euphoric tap routine on a train track (in 13/8 too!) Other numbers are rather thrown away, and where the Jellicle Ball should be the pinnacle of dance in the film, it feels understated and not a patch on the exhilarating dance routines seen week by week on Strictly Come Dancing. This is not helped at all by the decision to shoot endless close-ups of the cats' faces rather than just letting the audience watch the dance. The opening ensemble number feels even more amateur, as cats start singing their solos but the editor doesn't bother to cut to them until halfway through their line.

So, in summary, I didn't enjoy much of it. About an hour in I wanted the whole thing to end. It's got all sorts of technical problems and too many actors who are hopelessly miscast and misdirected in their roles. 'Cats' is one of the most curious failures of modern cinema. I'm glad I've seen it. I just never want to see it again."
6.0,8 January 2020,"This movie did not need to be made but at the same time I am glad it was made. Every time I thought it couldn't get any weirder, it got weirder. After watching the movie I can't remember any words from the songs because they were so forgettable. The only line I can remember is Jason Derulo yelling ""MILK"". Also, James Corden did not need to be in this."
1.0,22 December 2019,"This is my first review on here and after watching this garbage last night i had to note my opinion. Just lots of singing and dancing , devoid of any real storyline and actual acting. It became boring very quickly, it's very rare that in a cinema I want to get up and walk out early and the only reason I didn't was because of the family in there with me. On a plus side, the dancing was of a high standard and this would probably appeal to individuals that enjoy a musical"
3.0,3 January 2020,"Setting aside all of the other problems, lets talk about something that seems to be an epidemic in Hollywood. Once again they insult audiences by assuming we won't be satisfied just watching a dancer dance. The dance sequences, not numbers, suffer the same problem The Greatest Showman did. There are way too many cuts and special effects. A leap doesn't have to be Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon impossible to be beautiful. One of the reasons the Broadway version is successful at all is the dancing and that's because the audience is allowed to see it in it's entirety, not cut up to the point it's barely a dance at all. Long wide takes are what made the dancing in La La Land enjoyable to watch even if the dancers weren't Fred Astaire\Ginger Rogers astounding. It just proves we love to watch people dance. You'd think with the popularity of programs like So You Think You Can Dance and Dancing With the Stars it would be obvious even to Hollywood by now.

CATS the stage play is a weird experience to watch. Putting it on screen was always going to be difficult, but to virtually remove one of the only elements which made the original good gave this movie no chance of success. Others have commented on the lackluster music so I won't bother."
1.0,21 December 2019,"I took my mother (OAP) and my young daughter to see this, this evening, my daughter loves cats and singing and dancing and my mother likes musicals so I thought it would be a win win! Within 20 minutes of the film I knew this was a pile of utter crap! And was so delighted when my daughter whispered 'Mam can we go home' managed just over an hour (and that's an hour I'll never get back!) really wish I had read the reviews on here before going but hey ho you live you learn"
1.0,31 December 2019,"I can't Stand cats any more... Really... What the hell you thinking!?

What do you think about creating this movie, are you guys OK or mental sick?!

Just a bunch of big actors (Not anymore) covered with CGI plade and jump all over the place!! The End."
1.0,26 December 2019,"Unfortunately, I couldn't give this movie 0 stars.

One of the most excruciating things I have had the misfortune of sitting.

Please save your money and sanity. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE.

Thank you for your cooperation."
1.0,3 January 2020,"If you like Musicals, good Dancing and the Music of Andrew Lloyd Weber, don´t miss it. I nearly did not go because of all the bad critics and finally before they take it off the screen I have seen it and really enjoyed every second. Maybe the reason so many people don´t like it is because it is so different to anything else you would see in the cinema these days, but it is amusing, the dancing is top class with Francesca Hayward being a Principal ballerina from the Royal Ballet, first class singers, and keeping more or less to the story from the Musical. I recommend it."
1.0,20 December 2019,"I just got out of CATS

Whilst I do not get the hate it's getting, I did not love nor did I hate it, it's just meh..... It kind of lacks an identity James Corden and Rebel Wilson think its a comedy and then you have Judy Dench and Ian McKellanacting their asses off!! It's very uneven and I'm not even sure what happened!! I kind of get it, but I'm not 100% I think an hour in, I didn't really know the plot, it kicks in towards the end, but for most of the movie I thought they were saying ""Angelica Cats"" but it was ""jellicle cats"" which I had to Google to see what it was.

The songs are used every time a new character is introduced, and are pretty bland!! Even the big showstopper 'memoroes' sang by Jennifer Hudson doesn't hit the emotional notes like it should. The dance numbers were entertaining but I was frustrated everytime I was following a certain character, it would cut away to someone else.

Taylor Swift is really not in the movie a lot, she really does not have a lot of screen time. She is the moll to Idris Elba's bad guy, turns up sings one song near the end and is then gone.

Francesca Hayward plays the main character Victoria, and she is great as is the CGI, there is no faulting it looks great.

I'm not sure this is going to be a big hit, a man in front of me audibly sighed several times, before leaving his wife/girlfriend to watch the rest of the movie, whilst some girls near me laughed a lot at it."
1.0,30 December 2019,"Wow. I am highly disappointed. I had high expectations for this movie. I love musicals, and cats. But this sad excuse of a movie is the worst of 2019 movies. The people including me who paid to see this are honestly some fricking suckers. I hope I can get a refund. Bull crap."
9.0,24 March 2020,"Great films bring together the writing, directing, acting, visuals and audio to create captivating and emotional works of storytelling that are both technically and artistically brilliant. It is these great films that have a profound impact on audiences and the progress of cinema as a craft. 'Cats' is not a great film. 'Cats' is possibly the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of seeing in a movie theatre.

There is no story, no conflict, no characterisation, no character arcs. The tone is wildly inconsistent, averaging out to an inescapable feeling of intense discomfort. The acting ranges from bland to embarrassing, made all the more disappointing given the level of talent among the cast. The visuals are best described as nightmarish. The sound mix is audibly grating. It is almost unbelievable to see a movie fail so spectacularly in all areas and at all levels.

'Cats' doesn't even have the decency to fall into the category of 'so bad it's good'. Rather than a genuine creative swing and miss this feels more like a culmination of uncaring gross misjudgments."
7.0,3 January 2020,Did anyone even see a plot in this movie? I wish I could have gotten my money back. The soundtrack was decent that's why I'm generous with my rating but dang. This is definitely the worst movie I've seen in a very very long time.
1.0,4 January 2020,"I'm sitting in the movie writing this review because I at least want to make it one hour before I leave. But this movie is terrible. I guess it works if you want to take a nap, or want the experience of what an trip would feel like without having to take."
3.0,5 January 2020,"It seems to me there is an unusually large amount of criticism for this film. Many moan about the minutiae such as the absence of any humans and why do some cats wear clothes and some not. These critics are simply missing the point which is that this film is a fantasy.

And many bang on about the sexual undertones of this film. Really? I think those people need to get out more! Yes I was personally drawn to the feline beauty of Victoria the leading character, who wouldn't be, but other than that I think the actors were all trying to behave like cats do.

And as for the criticism over the creepy CGI, well what do you want these characters to look like? They are people dressed up as cats, they are re-enacting a famous theatre production, I'm not sure the makers of this film could have done it any other way.

But for all those vacuous criticisms, there is some real criticism that needs to be leveled at this film.

I'm aware of the Cats musical but never saw it, I'm aware of Elaine Page's smash hit of the most famous song from that production. I have an inquiring mind and love to be entertained but I struggled to understand what was going on and I was completely left cold by the film other than that one famous and very emotional song towards the end.

There is a complete and utter lack of any dialogue. A lot of the lyrics in the songs themselves are difficult to grasp or make sense of. And there really is a complete lack of a decent plot of any kind to involve the audience with. There's a lot of dancing, a lot of singing, a lot of mumbo jumbo talk, but that's about it. There is only so long that I can watch endless singing and dancing! My guess is that this film closely re-enacts the original stage show. If so, then I really do doubt I would like that stage show at all either to be honest. You can get away with a lack of a plot if the performance is filled with wonderful, memorable songs. Cats isn't.

So who loves this film and gives it 10 stars? I think it must mainly be fans of the original musical. If you haven't seen that musical then possibly, like me, you will find this film version empty, baseless and only vaguely entertaining.

I really do think that the makers of this film needed to think rationally about how best to take the original musical and depict it on the screen, if indeed that was a wise thing to attempt at all. However I think they were too romantically entwined with the original musical production to be objective as to what a modern day audience requires from a film. Films today are sophisticated with complex plots and timelines, we as the audience absorb that complexity with ease. Cats the film is so lacking in anything at all that could be called sophisticated. The music alone doesn't cut it. Making this film was either a missed opportunity or a bad error of judgement."
1.0,17 January 2020,"Smoke a little weed, put the mind in neutral, and forget that the collars around the kitties' necks have a tendency to move just slightly slower than the necks themselves. Dont ask why one cat is stripping off her skin to show more fur underneath - and certainly dont ask what her outer garment would be made of. Really, just dont do it.

It never ceases to amaze me when a director takes essentially bulletproof material like this and says, ""Hey, let's see what I can do to really screw it up."" Still, it had some nice moments (that lasted maybe a few seconds apiece) and some intriguing ideas (that lasted even shorter time). The background were, in the main, charming, but clearly meant for another movie altogether. Maybe a French musical with Gene Kelly. But not this one."
1.0,20 December 2019,"This will change your whole perspective of view when you look at at your own cats. I tried so hardly to enjoy this movie with my Friskies Special Edition Popcorn and my Fancy Feast Soda, but my brain just turned into a giant hairball. CGI HumanCats should be censored!"
1.0,28 December 2019,So disappointed and No sense of humour compared to the live musical. Slow songs went on for far too long (or so it felt) and I honestly struggled to stay awake. Storyline was slow and I'm still confused what exactly the story is.
4.0,26 December 2019,"Broadway meets unintentional Horror in a film that will one day be a midnight movie! Mark my words. Great songs, awesomely horrendous CGI, magical choreography, and hauntingly gorgeous backgrounds. Cats is a beautiful disaster that I loved! It's only real flaw is Rebel Wilson sucks. Everything else screams cult classic!"
2.0,2 January 2020,"You don't greenlight a film and rush it to be released by a certain date. Truth, it wasn't just this. The director is pretty much culpable as well. CGI? Who thought this would be appropriate after watching the musical. Granted this was a risk but it was just awful. Letting them ""redo"" the film for a re-release was a joke. Nothing can save this clunker. Don't get me started on the actors in this litter pan of poop. I have more respect for low budget nonsense than this charade. This film doesn't deserve a rating. Watch it for the laughs but don't let your cats find out.🐈"
1.0,3 January 2020,"It is a film about singing cats. It is based on a musical where humans dressed as cats prance around and sing. What were all you haters actually expecting? To state an unpopular opinion, I quite enjoyed it. Lower your expectations and this is actually solid entertainment. Ian McKellen and Judy Dench dressed up as cats, dancing around and singing poetry from the 1930's...sounds abstract but fun. #giveCatsAChance: you might mildly enjoy it."
8.0,20 December 2019,Terrible wish I could rate it zero stars. They changed what the musical was originally about.
6.0,20 December 2019,"Much like Venom last year, Cats is a ""worst movie of the year"" that isn't all that bad. The movie has its fair share of flaws, but the bright spots are very bright.

The CGI isn't as eye bleed worthy as I thought it would be, the comedy was missplaced in some parts but in others made me chuckle, the singing was inconsistent, however, mostly good, as was the acting, and overall look of the film was decent. By far my biggest complaint is the lack of a compiling naritive. The film was unclear in what its plot was until fairly far in, and even when it did lay out its master plan I felt it was far too simple for a movie as long and as costly as this one was.

What saves the movie is beautiful singing from Jennifer Hudson among others, and musical set pieces that are a joy to watch. I don't think I will re-watch this anytime soon, but I kinda glad I did at least once."
1.0,22 December 2019,A terrible movie. Everything is so wrong with the film. It is really bad. It feels so off and poorly made.
2.0,27 December 2019,If you give this more than a one star you should be punched in the face multiple times
1.0,21 December 2019,Lmao I am not even going to talk about it. This movie was so horrible that its giving me nightmares.
2.0,25 December 2019,Ok loads of people hate this but there is no CONFLICT
1.0,1 January 2020,"Hollywood pulled a fast one on us. They probably just gave a bunch of Elementary schoolers a camera set. Whoever gave this anything more than 1 star needs to see a therapist (really anyone that saw this).

1.0,25 January 2020,So much bad singing and terrible cgi also so boring
1.0,28 December 2020,I actually enjoyed watching this! Always kept me wondering what's going to happen next! Despite the reviews I'd give it another watch too
1.0,31 January 2020,"From the trailer, I thought it would be horrendous. And it was. I already lost all interest in the film when they were just singing the first song. I can't tell what they are singing about in the first song. Then, the characters bursts into random dances and songs. I tried hard to stay awake, but I still don't know what the story is about at all. The characters are very disturbing to look at as well, which is not good."
10.0,3 September 2020,"I knew this story was a classic old stage musical that was incredibly popular. I'd never seen it before but was familiar with a few of the songs.

Had I gone into this movie expecting a disney or pixar type presentation I'd have been disappointed. Instead I expected to see something resembling a stage performance enhanced with some movie world magic and that's exactly what I got."
7.0,28 December 2019,"UGH, what even is there to say about this movie. The choreo was okay but the acting and pretty much everything else about the movie is a disaster. There's no real plot and making the cats still look human is kind of disturbing to say the least. I would say that casting new people would've made this movie better but frankly I don't think anything would help. I was ready to stop watching it after 5 minutes but I figured I should give it a chance in case it got better. It didn't. This isn't even worthy of one star. Someone seriously should've stopped this from being made because it isn't doing any good for anyone. Some musicals are just meant to stay in the theatre."
1.0,26 December 2019,"I saw Cats on stage over 30 years ago and enjoyed the music but thought it was a weird story. My expectations were low going into the theater this morning and when it was over, my friend and I just laughed at how truly horrid it was. The CGI is beyond bad and Taylor Swift needs to NEVER act again. Seriously, she was the worst, her accent was painful to listen to. The only redeeming part of the movie was Jennifer Hudson and her big number. The ending was laughable to say the least. The sad thing is there was so much talent in this movie and it was just wasted on cheesy CGI and painful to watch cat moves. Tom Hooper, you should ashamed of yourself"
1.0,25 January 2020,"Just don't, literally the worst thing I have to experienced."
2.0,28 December 2019,I just dragged my husband to try and see for myself how it could be so bad with that cast but seriously cringeworthy and cant understand how any director or producer could sit watching this back still allowed it to be released 🙈🙈🙈.
1.0,27 December 2019,Dont waste your time and money. I was like yeah i give it a chance... and fell asleep! Its really boring....
1.0,27 December 2019,"This is such a weird film that has a lot of flaws and makes me question its existence at times, the CGI used is just awful the cats hands weren't even catlike at all making it look like the actors were just wearing some weird cat suits. The story is a jumbled mess that makes no sense and is barely coherent and makes me think if they took out the 20 minutes worth of celebrity cameos they could have created a decent enough story. This film like Les Miserables uses lyrics instead of dialogue but in this instance it just doesn't work. Most of the 2nd act was extremely boring and had me checking my watch, and I think impatient viewers will leave the theatre if they go to see it because of how boring it is.

However I don't think its a complete dumpster fire, the songs (even though they were adapted from the original play) were nice to listen to especially Taylor Swifts song, also Jennifer Hudson has a part at the end which is quite nice and showed some promise but the pay off wasn't quite as good as what it should have been as they spent too much time messing around with the plot instead of developing a worthwhile arc for her character. I though that Idris Elbas character was interesting enough as well and thought most of his scenes were a nice distraction from some of the garbage shown. The production design was also very pretty and nice to look at giving the characters a nice background setting.

Overall Cats is a poor movie and has some complete garbage in it like its absolutely awful use of CGI and presenting one of the most messiest stories put to film this year but it did have enough moments to keep me watching until the end."

1.0,20 June 2020,"I can't see why people are giving this such a hard time. It's essentially an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.

I am not a fan of Andrew Lloyd musicals and haven't seen this on stage. I was expecting something more Like The greatest showman which this movie definitely is not and the story is hard to follow but I imagine this is perhaps the fault of the musical and not the film maker.

It was nice to watch, but more entertaining was watching the incredibly talented dancers who must have put a lot of hard work in to this film.

I give this 8/10 because if you like Lloyd Webber, stage musicals or just watching talented dancers then you will enjoy this film."

1.0,27 December 2019,"If you've known someone that's loved musical theater and Broadway, then at some point, Cats has been brought up. Some people love it and some just don't get it. I'll admit that I've seen the stage show twice (neither which were my idea) and it's not my thing. It's interesting to see the makeup and junkyard design for something that's still abstract and light on story. In fact, all I can say about it is that it centers around a tribe of cats and several of them do a song and dance to be chosen for another life. And given how it's sung through its entirety, that's either going to make it or break it for most.

I know that Cats had been one of Broadway's longest running shows and continues to play at a lot of community theaters and touring groups. Naturally, this was also something that had been attempted as a movie. Cats is already hard to do on stage and would never be easy to translate. I know that when the first trailers popped up, it got a lot of negative feedback for its choice of CGI animation on the human-like cats. Does Cats translate to the big screen?

A white kitten Victoria (played by Francesca Hayward) is abandoned in an alleyway by its owner and is discovered by a group of street cats called the ""Jellicles"". Some include a magician Mr. Mistoffelees (played by Laurie Davidson) and Munkustrap (played by Robbie Fairchild). They take a liking to Victoria and take her to the Jellicle Ball where they say that their leader will select one for the chance to be taken to the Heaviside Layer and be granted another life. Brown cat Macavity (played by Idris Elba) badly wants the honor and will try to sabotage the other cats.

Storywise, this is all you need to know. Like the stage show, the rest consists of other cats singing and dancing their songs on why they should be chosen. Such cats include Bustopher Jones (played by James Corden), Rum Tum Tugger (played by Jason Delrulo), Gus the Theatre Cat (played by Ian McKellen), Jennyanydots (played by Rebel Wilson) and Bombalurina (played by Taylor Swift). Also in the mix, and ostrasized by the other cats is Grizabella (played by Jennifer Hudson). Who will Old Deuteronomy (played by Judi Dench) chose?

So who was Cats made for? It seems like that only fans of the stage show are going to get much out of Cats. The rest, including myself, get something that may have a lot of ambition, but comes out in a giant mess. I'll start by saying that there's little focus on story (again, like the Broadway show). I'm normally fine with a movie that's more loose with story, but you better make sure the characters are at least interesting. The ironic thing is even with a lot of characters getting songs, I know very little about them. Many of them have few scenes (sometimes only one) and the main cat herself, Victoria isn't that interesting.

It made me realize that the stage show broke the forth wall and took the audience on an abstract journey. I kind of wished the movie would have done something similar. It tries by having a cat fill in the role of the audience, but that gives us without a character to latch onto.

Let's talk about the CGI. I knew that something different was going to be done for the movie, but along with it not looking finished, the human-like design is so freakish, that I could see children having nightmares. It's ugly, gross and I hate looking at it for nearly two hours!

As a musical, some of the songs like ""Rum Tum Tugger"", ""Bustopher Jones"" and ""Jellicle Songs for Jellecle Cats"" are entertaining. The rest are fine, but nothing that I'm going to remember. I didn't even care for the way ""Memory"" was rearranged, making small moments big and vice versa.

In addition to the set design, it is at least impressive to look at. But even as a movie that's so bad that's good, I still can't recommend it as its still too boring.

I'll give this two stage cats out of ten. I'm not sure what Warner Brothers was thinking with the story, visuals, music, and even overall concept. Cats doesn't deserve a second life and let's just leave it at that."
1.0,28 December 2019,"I tried to like it but ...just couldn't. Singing was not all that good. Dancing was great, direction from Hooper was horrible. No flow or sense of story telling.

The 2019 version is amazing though. Seriously, I don't even like musicals. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews and just watch it and make your own opinion."
8.0,24 April 2020,"I have loved this movie for one simple reason - captivating. You see I am.not the Broadway regular. The majority of stage performances that I have seen is Disney fairytales and their productions , which are brilliant . I am not a keen fan of classical ballet. However , CATS is a beautiful front he word go. The casting was spot on whi h meant that you are absorbed in the whimsical world where cats walk on twos and talk and crack jokes as well. One needs to possess a degree of imagination , and then this Movie is amazing. The set designs are so detailed - I could see the oversized oven and the bicycle - the trash can filled with leftovers that looked pretty detailed. The movie , by the end of it makes you cry ,laugh , hope and finally cherish the good in life.

This is a movie that is truly a team effort and it absolutely shows. However every CAT still stands out."

Now we understand the story because of clear dialog and lyrics, camera cuts that help explain the scene, and relationships that are much more clear in the film than on stage. So much was made of Taylor Swift being in the cast, we thought she was the lead, but she only has one son, which she delivered beautifully. Go see this movie, it's well worth your time. SHAME on critics for letting their initial rating stand. They should have reviewed it again!"

1.0,17 January 2020,"The first time I genuinely regretted eating food before seeing Cats was around the 93-minute mark. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees, a human being with human hands and feet coupled with cat ears and a top hat and horrendous CGI, was nervously pacing around the backstage of a dark theater that was filled with other human-cat hybrids. Suddenly, AMC's Dolby Surround Sound speaker system began to broadcast a slurping sound that grew louder and louder as Mr. Mistoffelees approaches a figure who was hunched near the sash cords at stage left. The source of the slurping was Sir Ian McKellen, a legendary actor who was vigorously lapping up milk from a steel bowl and licking his paw-hands. This deeply upsetting activity ceased only when he realized that Mr. Mistoffelees was there to check on him. I was trying my best not to gag. It was difficult.

I saw this film on the evening of Wednesday, January 15, 2020, and while I'd originally assumed that one or two songs would inevitably linger in my head long after I'd left the theater, it was actually the slurping coming from the mouth of Magneto/Gandalf/Richard III that has haunted me for the past 48 hours and counting."
10.0,26 December 2019,"I went to see this today expecting the worst. The trailer seemed terrible, the cats seemed scary and the critics were very bad. However, as a real Cats fan, having seen the stage show four times, I was tempted to go and see for myself. And I thoroughly enjoyed it !! The music and words were very faithful, the plot was rather more substantial than the original show and the dancing was good. Ok, the CGI was perhaps not perfect, however the stage show never tried to make the cats look 100% human, and it was never the goal. However, I think that you need to appreciate the fact that it is an adaptation and that the whole point of it IS the dancing and the singing to the words of TS Eliot, without a real plot. So... go and see Cats, but keep in mind they've made a film of the stage show and not a show of the film !"
7.0,5 January 2020,I'm not sure why this film is being so totally destroyed by the critics and general public. It's a big screen version of the musical which it follows give or take the odd character change extra song etc. If you like the musical I feel you'd most probably like the film. If you don't like the film then it's very unlikely you'd like the musical. It is an unusual show that's for sure and I understand why it wouldn't appeal to everyone however I enjoyed it enough to think about going to see the live show. It seems that it has become a bit of fun for people to write a bad review. Not sure why but people can be so fickle or is that cats?

THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: Some nice dance moves still cannot help this movie which needs to be de-clawed for any moviegoer's safety.

JIM'S REVIEW: Critics have savagely reviewed the ""cat-aclysmic"" fiasco known as Cats, and the general public is hightailing it in another direction. But let me come to its defense for a short fleeting moment. I did enjoy some of the ballet, tap, and modern dance moves, that is, whenever I was able to see them. While it's true that Cats is not a good movie, it isn't the worst movie musical ever made as many now seem to be saying. Compared to Mame, A Chorus Line, Man of La Mancha, The Wiz and Annie, nothing comes near those infamous duds. But this film adaptation does come exceedingly close.

When Cats premiered on Broadway in 1981, it was a theatrical juggernaut, a eye-popping blending of song and dance with artistic showmanship that made it a must-see pop spectacle. Yes, the plot was nowhere to be seen, then and now, but there was enough stage craft to keep audiences dazzled. Alas, the film version of T. S. Eliot's ode to the feline life is mere kitty litter in comparison.

Tom Hooper's Cats is just creepy from its hybrid costumes and inconsistent make-up design to its out of proportion and literally out-of-place set design by Eve Stewart and Rebecca Pilkington (the major misstep in a film flawed with many moments). The buildings that show off parts of London continually show off and dwarf their inhabitants, both in stature and performances. Size does matter and one gets vertigo with the erratic changes in ratio dimensions. (When the film stays in mid-range, the annoying backdrops stop interfering with the performances. But...step back a few yards, and...oh my!)

Mr. Hooper seems content to showcase many of the musical numbers with more glitz than flair, and he allows much of Melanie Oliver's editing to sacrifice the dance movement with quick cuts and an overabundance of close-ups. The fault of this musical concept lies squarely at the paws of its filmmaker, Mr. Hooper. His misguided attempt at directing musicals must stop. He is a far better director when dealing with dramas and needs to stay within his own artistic limits.

His screenplay, co-authored with Lee Hall, is a muddle. The non-existent plot still has all of these kitty cats going to a Jellicle Ball to see which one will go to the Heaviside Layer and be resurrected into a new and better life. Both writers do try to add some sub-plots involving good and evil cats vying for this honor, but it is a silly attempt to add some substance over style that never really advances the plot. We meet each cat, listen to their ""tail"" of woe, watch them do their musical schtick and then it's onto the next audition. Some numbers are better than others, but one is absolutely dreadful: Rebel Wilson does an awful kitschy musical number that is some sort of daffy homage to Busby Berkeley complete with singing mice and dancing cockroaches...duh, the film's low point among few highs.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's score is mostly intact but the orchestrations are crass and updated with over engineered results. Everything is loud and lacking any subtlety. Perhaps too much catnip, or not enough. (The one new song, Beautiful Ghost, written by Sir Andrew and Ms Swift, is far from haunting.)

The entire concept is misguided and poorly executed, except for one musical number that celebrates song and dance very well, The Jellicle Ball. Animation would have been a better solution than this live-action mess. It's is a hairball inducing experience. These cats are sci-fi freaky mutants: more human than feline. Their facial features lack emotion amid sub-par CGI fur that never appears to be right, although the ear and tail movements are intriguingly accomplished. The costumes by Pace Delgado establish individual character traits rather quickly, but they just don't mesh with their over-sized surroundings. (So many questions and leaps of logic: Why do this creatures have hands instead of paws? Why couldn't the movie be filmed with more wide angle shots to actually see and enjoy the the dance moves in Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography? When did T.S. Eliot's poems have his cats become such sexual creature in the form of street prostitutes, vixens, and pimps? Why do some cats wear clothes and others go au naturel?)

The cast include a cast of hard-working professionals that put their faith in Mr. Hooper's hands and were betrayed and neutered. The victims include: an embarrassing Ms. Wilson, Idris Elba as the evil Macavity dressed as a cat-like pimp in skin-tight leotards and Taylor Swift as his sexy sidekick, Bombalurina, and Jason Derulo as a kinetic Rum Tum Tiger. Also brought into this brouhaha are fine dancers like Robbie Fairchild, Francesca Hayward, Steven McRae, and Laurie Davidson as Mr. Mistoffelees, but their grace and dancing skills are impaired by Mr. Hooper's filming. Jennifer Hudson belts out the signature tune from the show, Memory, and she bring some class to the affair, although her cat look is too grisly a Grizabella and this unfortunately distracts from the performance. Still, a few actors went through their paces unscathed: Judy Dench as the wise Old Deuteronomy, Ian Mc Kellen as Gus the Theatre Cat, and James Corden as the chubby Bustopher Jones.

Yet so many questions and leaps of logic remain lodged in my ""memory"": Why do this creatures have hands instead of paws? Why couldn't the movie be filmed with more wide angle shots to actually see and enjoy the the dance moves in Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography? When did T.S. Eliot's poems have his cats become such sexual creatures in the form of street prostitutes, vixens, and pimps? Why do some cats wear clothes and others go au naturel? As a far superior musical once said, ""Is a puzzlement!"")

The old adage goes: ""A cat has nine lives."", meaning it is able to endure or survive any disaster. Revising that saying to review, with a slightly German emphasis: ""This Cats has ""nein"" lives."", meaning this movie is a lifeless soul-crushing disaster that moviegoers may endure or survive...barely. Avoid."

The cast is awful and laughably bad, which is just so sad because a lot of these actors are really good but this movie doesn't show them respect at all. The songs and music are not original at all and I'm sure the songs are great in the musical but this movie just wow didn't do the songs justice. The cgi or practical effects whatever they are are awful and bad and just the stuff of nightmares. The sets are even bad too. The story is non existent. The character development is non existent also because the character development is just music and I don't even remember anything about the characters or even there names. Overall, cats is the worst movie of this year, this movie was a hair ball just waiting to be coughed up, don't see this movie don't even support it."

There's so much wrong going on in so many places at once that you don't know where (or where not) to look.

Since the actors shot the film in CGI suits and likely had no idea how they'd look in the finished film, it's even more impressive that Ian McKellan and Taylor Swift manage to rise above this train wreck with sly, self-deprecating turns.

1.0,29 December 2019,"I remember when I was younger I fell over and landed on my chin and broke my bottom has. This was preceded by a 6 hour wait at A&E in agony. I would rather have gone through that again than watch cats again.

The film is literally just introducing different types of cats and then moving on quickly to introduce another type of cat. And that's it! The CGI was appauling all the cats float about 2 inches from the ground, and it's just really bad and shocking for a 2019 blockbuster film. The music was very bad especially Jason Derulo, he was dreadful, it was just an attempted career boost for many of cats in that film. Also there is absolutely no plot and we never learn any of the cats names.

I also still don't know what a jelicul cat is, waste of money dont see under any circumstance"
1.0,22 December 2019,"I have never seen the musical that this film is based on but I am familiar with Andrew Lloyd Webber as I love Phantom of the Opera and everything about it. With that thought, I figured an adaptation of another of his musicals would be solid. The initial trailer was polarizing and drew warranted ire. To make matters worse the reviews that came out yesterday absolutely trashed the film. Now having seen it, it is safe to say that this film is laughably horrendous and certainly the worst film of the year. Wow, this was an incredible level of bad.

The film is about an abandoned cat named Victoria who is dropped into the streets one night. She becomes familiar with the other local cats of the town. It turns out there is a gang of cats named Jellicle's and she learns how to be one of them. There is a Jellicle ball where the selected cat wins the competition and gets sent to Heaviside Layer, which is desired by the cats. This film has an impressive ensemble cast, all of whom must be hanging their head in shame because this now appears on their resume.

From the opening scene the theater burst into laughter. Not because the film was intentionally comedic at the moment but because the CGI/effects are absolutely atrocious. I would have preferred regular live characters in cat make up than the off putting and at times creepy human face on effect heavy cat body. At times I wondered if Tom Hooper was self aware with how terrible everything looked but then I remembered he is a filmmaker linked with Oscar nominated films and don't think that was the case. The film was much like Les Miserables from Hooper which I also hated. Its almost completely music, song after song so its dull and boring.

The film feels so long because of the incessant singing and dancing and this makes it feel like there's nothing going on. The plot is incredibly thin and its painfully obvious. Its just song and dance introducing a new cat who then fades away into the background. Didn't care a whole lot for the music, although I am sure that its technically great. Not even Taylor Swift (who I love), could redeem this morbid affair. Even the intended humorous cat characters like Rebel Wilson and James Corden fall miserably flat.

I thought Black Christmas was going to be my worst film of 2019 but lo and behold a week later something takes that honor quick. It was an unwatchable horror show. People may like this for the so bad its good factor but for me this was a painful time. After hearing critical reaction I knew it would be bad and that is exactly what this is. Tom Hooper won't be living this failure down for a while.

My advise, if you were a fan of the stage show then this may be for you but for everyone else it's a total bore. The main problem is that the format of the original musical does not upscale to the movie screen due to its lack of story. The original west end show was a collection of individual portraits or cameos where the cats all met once a year for a party, that's it!

What worked

We had some strong characterisations from Judi Dench and Ian McKellan.

The music was good

What went wrong

The west end show's main element was the cats interaction with the audience this was missing.

The original show was funny and sexy, this was humourless and the CGI removed any sense of sexuality, they were all sexless hermaphrodites.

The show had pace this movie dragged and it just did not have the pop pop pop of the original.

Overall, whilst well done this was a mere shadow of the original production and to my mind was a project that perhaps didn't need doing."
3.0,29 December 2019,"Yes, this is a goofy ridiculous movie, but that was why the musical was so loved and it does not deserve the amount of butthurt the plebs and snobs are giving it. Real criticism: They cut a whole scene and some characters. The new song beautiful ghosts, seemed really shoved in. Added scenes, like on Growltiger's boat, were incredibly silly. Theater people say the choreography was changed. On the plus side, I loved the colorful neon 1930s London setting. I loved the synthesizers in the score. I loved the weird illogical moments, they were surreal and mesmorized me. I'm more than happy to go see something weird while everyone else is pushing out formulaic ""safe"" stuff. As for the look of the cats I had no problem with it, and frankly, was more than happy to see Idris Elba's dancing silhouette. It was no more weird than the Cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz. Get off your high horse and go see this if you just want to have cheeky good fun."
8.0,23 November 2020,"Very enjoyable, the digital representation was just fine, and the performances were great. If you enjoyed the original costumes from the 80's then you'll enjoy this digital representation."
7.0,27 March 2020,"After its end, the basic conclusion is, in Cats case, the stage is the only perfect space. The film ? It is easy to write it is bad, awful, horrible. But it is unfair for you. Because you expect see it, for the cast, first. Because you hope, scene by scene, to be better. And,maybe, because you are a cats owner. Or this film seems be a band destroying everything. From the perspective about cats to the prestige of actors and the musical itself. Off course, it has few nice sparkles. Not many, but nice ones. But , in same measure, it has some grotesque moments too. As refuge, for me, the comparation with Romanian film Veronica works well, the tomcat Danila being more admirable than this crowl. The good thing - maybe the tails and their movements. And,sure, good intentions. But , unfortunately, it is far to be enough."
2.0,3 November 2020,"I am a fan of the musical, having seen it at least 6 times. So I was excited to see the big screen version. The bad reviews scared me off. But they were not accurate. This is a good movie.

It's not exactly like the musical. There is some dialogue. It follows a new character, Victoria as she follows a group of cats bidding for a chance to be reborn in the Heaviside Layer. That's the story. It's not the story. It's the songs that make Cats so revered. And they have some good singers. Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, James Corden and Rebel Wilson all show up strong.

It has some other interesting cast choices with Sir Ian McCellan and Dame Judy Dench. They were wonderful.

Don't believe the hate."
1.0,30 December 2019,...this is the worst film of the 21st century. Every single person involved should be thoroughly ashamed and every famous actor deserves to see their market value take at least a 40% hit in their earning potential. What on earth were they all thinking? This is a dog of a film.
1.0,21 December 2019,"Never saw the play but just saw the movie. I was in shock. Kept waiting to find out what the roar ""or meow"" was all about. The tunes weren'r catchy. The lyrics weren't clever and although Jennifer Hudson was good, i thought Betty Buckley sang ""Memories"" like no one else. It was like the Emperor's new clothes. No one wants to admit he's naked. No on wants to admit that Cats sucks."
1.0,25 December 2019,I can watch the Serbian Film start to finish but couldn't get past 15 minutes of this trainwreck.
1.0,24 December 2019,"Just before I went to see this film I had a vision that cats was a terribly put together film where the run time consisted of songs after songs and no dialogue in between for background information. That was precisely what I didn't get. Instead the film was well crafted AMAZING visual effects and the best acting in a musical I have ever seen.

All jokes aside I found this film awful to the point I had to gouge me eyes out! Yes this film had pretty good songs and a great musical score, which is mainly why I'm rating it a 5/10, the songs weren't memorable apart from the song memory which I have heard before on a tv show. There wasn't really a plot to the film that stood out to me and the visual effects for the humanised cats were so bad that throughout the film I could see the feet from them jumping all over the place instead of on the floor like it should be! The thing that could of made me won't to rate cats higher was if Tom Hooper (the director) had them in costumes like the musical instead of spending millions of pounds so that people can make a meme out of it.

Overall if you liked the musical then you would probably like the film, up until the point were you have to be high or drunk. The fact that Tom Hooper made amazing and Oscar worthy films in the past like Les Miserable and the king's speech makes me want to believe that a good director will never stay a good director!"
1.0,30 December 2019,Don't waste your money at the cinema. Don't waste money buying or renting the dvd. Unlike a cat.... we humans only get one life... this poor excuse of a film will waste far too much of yours!!!
1.0,31 December 2019,"Truly ambitious movie which has themes hope retribution and kindness.... themes surely needed in this climate we live in.... I tend to judge movies and fact most anyting from the view of perception and intention. You see, no one makes a movie assembles wonderful Talent spend unheard-of amounts of money to intentionally have people dislike it...... now that's not to say I didn't fall asleep in certain sections of the picture...... and that doesn't mean that at times the direction is a bit leaden. But for the most part I understood what the director was trying to accomplish and commend him for it and actually had a good time Judi Dench Taylor Swift Idris Elba Jennifer Hudson and Company perform and emote very very well the dance sequences very well done however this was a hard project to pull off from being on Broadway......

Go see the film and open your heart and maybe then you'll understand.... a very well-intentioned movie musical but simply not for everybody..."
1.0,25 December 2019,"Putting aside my feelings about the weird character designs, which would have never worked; This film was horrible from start to finish, I wanted to walk out after 30min, but I paid for it and didn't want to get called out for not watching it the whole way through by friends, so I begrudgingly stayed. What was even the point, this was extremely boring, offensive even. Hollywood, NEVER ever let someome else translate a play into a film again! As a furry I am also offended."

7.0,22 December 2019,"Right, cons: weird CGI (I wish it was just the original costumes). Some interesting casting... but counteracting by some brilliant casting. Okay, what people seem to forget is this is adapted from a stage show, which is exactly how it is portrayed. Each song is spectacular, I felt as though I should clap after each singer had their solo. And the choreography is brilliant. Yes cats is weird. But it's just a creative little journey you take in the eyes of what cats get up to :) what's not to love?! Peace out"
2.0,4 April 2020,"I can only assume a bunch of people who've never been to the theatre got to this first, then helped it become the victim of viral hatred. Maybe the original was much worse. Anyway, I can't agree.

I saw Cats at the theatre about 20 years ago. This is a musical, it's about cats and it's acted by humans. There are aspects to this that aren't your run-of-the-mill action adventure. The compares well, and was an enjoyable watch, with sufficient suspension of disbelief.

It's charming."

6.0,20 May 2020,"There is no surprise here on what you are going to get. Humans dressed as cats walking, talking, singing and dancing. The poor reviews are reviewing the strange content, not the movie. CATS is one of the longest running events on Broadway and thusly notorious for its bizarre theme/story line. As for the movie version"" Cats brings it. The incorporation of dance - all kinds from classic ballet to street, hip hop, jazz, is impeccable. It has comedy, drama and suspense. The music and singing is on point. It is a treat, it was well done in its transition to the big screen. It is worth the time to watch. The bad reviews do not do this movie any justice as it was not trying to be a ""new"" thing - it is a rendition of a long standing, well loved, albeit insane plot that made millions on Broadway. Everything I expected and more."
1.0,5 September 2020,I know I will be slated for this review but I enjoyed it. It's no Hollywood blockbuster but take it for what it is. A stage show. Not the most catchy of songs but does contain a couple of foot tapping songs which I enjoyed. In my opinion it deserves much more than the reviews it has received. It really is down to personal taste. It's a thumbs up from me. Even my 83 year old mother enjoyed it. Make up your own mind. Give it a go you may find yourself pleasently surprised. As were we.

1.0,30 December 2019,"This movie gave me nightmares and I haven't slept in a few days. It's so bad I am planning on taking a break from watching movies for a couple weeks. I actually know how they filmed this terrible movie, they used one of the face filters from the snapchat app. I heard they even went to ""cat school"" to train to be a cat. Why in god's name would you even think about going to this abomination? This is also a great way to interrogate criminals because they would break in less than 5 minutes guaranteed."

6.0,4 June 2020,"Seems almost everyone dislikes this movie, but, sorry, I did enjoy it. Preferred the stage version, but not everyone can just pop down the West End and take it in. OK so musicals rarely if ever contain deep philosophical messages - if you want that look elsewhere. It's a piece of creative musical theatre, and a bit of harmless frivolity which hurts nobody , I guess"
1.0,11 September 2021,"I've been a fan of Cats for a very long time. I watched the 1998 direct-to-video, I'm familiar with the songs and characters, and even acted as Gus the Theater Cat on one school play.

That's why when this film is announced, I'm genuinely excited, since the trailer and the casts impressed me. Ever since the trailer was released, there's already a backlash, but I didn't mind it and waited patiently.

When it came out, I'm sad about how it was perceived by the audiences. I watched the film thrice, but I think that it is a decent adaptation. There might be overly dull or overly active moments, but it is enjoyable as a whole.

I hope more people will appreciate this."

1.0,26 December 2019,"Cats is a film adaptation of the musical of the same name. The film is partly written and produced by Tom Hooper, the director of Les Misérables and The Danish Girl.

In the film, the cat named Victoria (Francesca Hayward) wakes up among the cats, the Jellicles cats. Every year in the cat world it is decided which cat can travel to heavenly low to start a new cat life. Victoria tries to have a chance to be chosen so that she can start a new life, but for this she has to compete with many other cats.

This film adaptation of a musical is not as good for Tom Hooper as the success he had with the film adaptation of the musical Les Misérables. At Les Misérables he also had a story with characters and a suitable film set to work with. With Cats he really only has a film set on which various household objects stand up in an enlarged way to show how great something such as a chair or cupboard is for a cat. The film also has no real story except that the cats are all trying to be chosen to start a new cat life. As a viewer you get too little information to be able to follow exactly how the story of the film works.

The only thing to enjoy are the singing and dance work of the cast, but to hear the music you can just look up the music on YouTube. That way you don't have to try to follow the unclear story. You can't see the dance movements like that, but they also come across a bit separately. The entire cast wears a special outfit to make them look like cats with special effects. Not their entire bodies have been transformed into cats, because they simply retain their human hands and feet. The actors' faces also seem to be simply placed on their bodies with a sort of Snapchat filter. The creations of what the characters in the film look like, can sometimes come across as somewhat comical or a little scary for younger viewers.

The singing, dancing and acting are also well done by the cast, but the unclear story and appearance of their characters makes it hard to take most seriously. The cast consists of famous actors such as Judi Dench and Ian McKellen to artists such as Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo. The best acting is provided by Idris Elba. He plays the villain of the story, who tries to eliminate his competition to have a chance to start a new cat life. Despite the unclear story and his ridiculous cat appearance, he nevertheless tries to portray his role in a serious and fitting way in the film."
1.0,22 December 2019,"What exactly I was expecting? Who knows, but this was not it. As I was 'Kind of' forced to go, by my wife, all because I had told her I wanted to see 'Rise of Skywalker' after it.

This film is like a Hallucinogenic trip in Pet World. There is no plot, as such, just lots of incidental plots and action, plus wasted talent!

I am not adding more to this review, as the film is utter nonsense. Guessing who the stars are under the CGI is a good game to play, that's if you're forced like me to go and see it.

2/10 for the wild experience only. Oh, and a few laughs at how bad it is."
9.0,10 February 2020,Saw the trailer of this while waiting for another movie on the cine... what they have done
7.0,20 November 2020,"Cats is a sung-through musical (a musical play with virtually no spoken dialogue) composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the 1939 poetry collection Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T. S. Eliot. It tells the story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and the night they make the ""Jellicle choice,"" deciding which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life. The set of Cats consists of a junkyard filled with oversized props to give the illusion that the cast, costumed and made up to appear as cats, are the size of actual cats. The musical includes the well-known song ""Memory"" as sung by Grizabella, the so-called Glamour Cat. As of 2019, Cats remains the fourth-longest-running Broadway show and the sixth-longest-running West End show. The film is directed by Tom Hooper-in his second feature musical following Les Misérables (2012)-from a screenplay by Lee Hall (screenwriter of the 2000 film Billy Elliot) and Hooper and features an ensemble cast, including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward along with other leading singers and dancers of varying disciplines. In the revised book of the musical, Victoria (Hayward), a young white cat, is dropped in the streets of London by her owner in the middle of the night. The alley cats witnessing this introduce themselves to her as the ""Jellicles"". Two toms, meek magician Mr. Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson) who develops a crush on Victoria and the loyal Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild), and two queens, the snooty Cassandra (Mette Towley) and Demeter (Daniela Norman), take Victoria under their wing and show her the world of the Jellicles as they tell of the Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where cats compete for the chance to go to the Heaviside Layer and be granted a new life. Francesca Hayward is an English ballet dancer and actress, a principal dancer in the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in London. The classically beautiful dancer makes her film debut in Cats. Robbie Fairchild is a principal dancer at the New York City Ballet also making his film debut. Academy Award winning actress Judi Dench was cast in the original stage musical but had been forced to pull out due to a torn Achilles tendon, to be replaced at the last minute by Elaine Paige. Lloyd Webber and Hooper decided to make the wise and beloved Old Deuteronomy a woman and offered her the role. Ian McKellen played Gus the Theatre Cat. Idris Elba joined the cast of the film as master criminal Macavity the Mystery Cat; he possesses mystical powers and is the antagonist of the musical. Taylor Swift, one of Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, appears as mischievous femme fatale Bombalurina, who performs a song and dance number dedicated to Macavity: a distraction to incapacitate the party with catnip. James Corden is Bustopher Jones, Steven McRae is Skimbleshanks and Ray Winstone is Macavity henchman Growltiger. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella the Glamour Cat delivers an iconic performance of the show's signature song ""Memory"". Andy Blankenbuehler, choreographer of Hamilton, choreographed the film, after Wayne McGregor was forced to back out due to scheduling conflicts. Blankenbuehler also choreographed the stage musical's 2016 Broadway revival. Andrew Lloyd Webber announced he would be writing a new song for the film adaptation; the new song is titled ""Beautiful Ghosts"", written by Taylor Swift and Lloyd Webber. The song will be sung by Francesca Hayward, followed later in a reprise by Judi Dench, with a credits version sung by Swift. Inexplicably, the film, IMHO a breath-taking realization of Lloyd Weber's legendary 1981 musical which deepens ever further its connection to Eliots source material, received overwhelmingly negative reactions from critics. The film's original release purportedly contained numerous CGI errors and glitches. After poor reviews, Universal notified cinemas on opening day that an updated Digital Cinema Package with improved visual effects would be available for download within a few days, urging them to replace the current print as soon as possible. Cats grossed $27.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $47.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $74.6 million, against a production budget of about $95 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net loss of the film to be $113.6 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues. I have no doubt that time will deliver a much more appreciative verdict on this dazzling and beautifully made fantasy."
1.0,29 June 2020,"I have a theory that the rating is this low because all the fans of the musical are upset that it's not true to the original.. which is ironic, cause they tried to make a storyline to make it easier to understand. However, this is a musical with absolutely no storyline, so non-musical people hate it because of the lack of a storyline :') So no one really likes it I guess..!? That said, I think they did a decent job creating a story to follow, and added a bit of humour. I don't hate it. Singing was fine.. I could have done with a bit more dancing, but I'm not mad about it. And the cgi isn't as bad as people are trying to make it!? Maybe I've seen the edited version, I don't know. In that case, its not as bad as it was I guess :)

So if you like musicals, and isn't a hardcore fan of Cats who can't stand a bit of change, this is not a bad movie :) Do not watch this if you're not a musical fan. And do NOT watch for an exciting story. That goes for ANY production of Cats!! You watch Cats for the music and dancing ;)"

1.0,21 December 2019,"Let me start, I have always been a fan of Cats. I've seen the Original Production at the Winter Garden, so yes, I was looking forward to the film adaption. What people seem not to realize, you can not adapt a play like this into a film. Cats, the musical, has numerous performers off screen jumping , moving etc.

The film, is shot in a soundstage, nothing feels real. Idris Elba, great actor, but he felt off. Idris's character "" disappears"" repeatedly which gets to be both annoying and dumb. The way it's done feels cheep; like a Saturday Morning Cartoon in the 70's.

There is a B story line where Idris Elba's character "" disappears"" with James Corden , Rebel Wilson & Ian Mckellan which felt vey awkward and uncomfortable. First, why did Ian look like he didn't want to be on set and was calling his lines in? James Corden, is not the right ""actor"" at all for this role at all. He tried to be to comicky. Rebel Wilson. I don't understand the likability, she and Corden had a Lucy and Ethel thing going which was annoying.

There are some great number's. The visuals are poor, the acting is poor, and the sets are pretty tame in nature. Where did the 95 million dollars go towards? Green screens and a set? I left feeling disappointed, I was eager when I saw the first trailer, I am convinced Corden ruins every project he is in. Stick to just the Late Latte Show, you don't see Seth Meyers in Cats for a reason.

6.0,11 December 2020,"I definitely wasn't disappointed! A life long fan of the play. I was first introduced to the play when I was 5, seeing it live at the Kennedy center. Then we named our cats Macavity & Jennyanydots. The play released on VHS, watched it 100x! The movie brings those sets to life. Casting was perfect! Don't compare the movie to the play, nor to an actual movie. Because then you will be disappointed. It's not entertaining in the way of plot and dialogue. However seeing the songs I grew up loving come to life, well that was a treat. Plus my name is Kat and ""Meow, Meow"" is like my ""Aloha"". So watching Idris Elba say ""meow"" tickles me in a special way. Watch it to enjoy seeing the cats you love sing those songs that pull on your heart strings. Don't watch to be enthralled with suspension."
1.0,14 October 2020,"It's sad, though to some extent understandable, that Cats attracted so much hate. It's simply not a film (musical) for everybody.

Hooper transformed the original play to feature-length film without any big changes. I think it's not fair to critize things (messy plot, weird characters, etc.) that are also in the orignal play.

The CGI looks weird but it's not problem to get used to it after few minutes, choreography is great, musical numbers are modernized and mostly well done.

Cats is overall not bad, but also not great musical."
1.0,26 December 2019,Lasted 35 minutes. I could not believe what I witnessed. I am going to need to see a therapist to help me overcome the horror.. I can't even look at my cat anymore. What did the human race do to deserve this?
1.0,5 January 2020,"Boring. I almost fall asleep twice. The story makes no sens at all. I don't know the original musical but the songs were boring and half of it sounded like opera recitatives. Totally forgettable. The worst interpretation of ""Memories"" I have ever heard. And that is the only good song there. Does Jennifer Hudson can even sing? To take the cast like that, people who can sing (well.. Hudson), dance, perform, act and make that dreadful piece... That takes real talent. CGI ""costumes"" didn't bother me that much, except maybe for Rebel Wilson, that was obscene."

Nightmarish, haunting, unsettling, weird, terrifying, ghastly, LSD induced fever dream are some of the perfect words to explain this movie. I will be laughing nervously for rest of my life every time someone mentions this movie to me.

All the actors in this movie..this is your legacy now. And you cant undo it."
1.0,5 January 2020,"This is hands down the worst movie that I have ever had the displeasure of watching. I understand the concept that they were going for and that the dancers were talented but everything else about this movie was horrible, the dry and repetitive jokes from Rebel Wilson and the near zero dialogue makes this movie painful to watch. Even the star studded cast could save this from being close to 2 hours of garbage."

I could overlook the continuity and scaling goofs. But whatever possessed Judi Dench to agree to take part in this mess? Maybe she doesn't understand CGI and how it can mess things up. I thought her bits were appalling and she needs to take 50% of the blame for why this film is so bad - as for trying to make out that her character is trans - what nonsense!"

Okay the CGI is imperfect and the way the Cats move is odd, but if you sit back and immerse yourself it is a bit of crazy fun. This is based on a bonkers musical so why can't it be a bonkers film? The music is true (ish) to the stage show and everyone seems to be having a good time. I liked it, my advice is go see is and don't take everything so seriously, real life is tough enough"

The only thing worth watching is Francesca Hayward. You can tell she is a professional dancer and actress. She was amazing. She deserves a better film to be in. She hypnotized us all with her elegant talent. My advice to Francesca Hayward is that you are a TRUE STAR, don't give up.

The costumes were ok but the tails and the ear movements were amazing."

7.0,4 January 2020,"Yesterday, I was sitting in a restaurant, watching people walking by; some of them seemed happy, some content, most just caught up in the hustle and bustle of their everyday lives...looking at these people, I could immediately tell that they all had one thing in common: none of these people had just sat through 'Cats'. 'Cats' is the kind of movie you go see before having a colonoscopy to make the procedure seem like a trip to Disney Land in comparison. Sitting through this film was, and I'm not exaggerating here, the most painful movie-going experience of my life, more than that, it was one of the most painful experiences of my life. That time the horse kicked me, awesome after what I just sat through, all those bad Tinder dates, I'll marry any of them, attending my own mother's funeral not nearly as painful as sitting through this vile piece of cinema. Now, I'll be straight, the stage play 'Cats' has never been a show that spoke to me personally and I have only seen limited extracts from the show itself. Yet, I could appreciate it. The makeup, the choreography, the singing talents, the casting...even if it wasn't my personal taste, I was still able to appreciate the enormous talent behind all of it and sometimes respect for source material means more than truly enjoying it. And that is what this film adaptation lacked severely, there was no respect for the source material it was based on. 'Cats' is a production that never should have been adapted to film, it couldn't. It has to be seen live to appreciate the on-stage talent. What this film brought us is badly CGI'd characters, looking creepy as hell, doing choreography that has been toned down from the show it's based on, with a whole lot of A-list actors singing mostly out of tune. Seriously Hollywood, you made this same mistake with Les Miserables, just because an actor is a big name it does not mean he can sing and viewing it is cringe worthy. And that is what I felt for most the running time of this film, I was cringing, I felt uncomfortable, I was checking the time every 5-minutes, I just wanted this nonsensical. unpleasant, piece of trash to end so I could get out of there. And it took forever, the end of this movie felt like it was trolling me with at least 5-points where I thought the film was over, me jumping up and then it starts again - Cats, you are not freaking 'Lord of the Rings' and you do not get to do that! When it finally did, I walked out of the cinema in a daze, I was ready to dump my entire movie collection into the garbage and to never watch another movie again, I was angry, I was sad, but mostly I just felt empty. Empty knowing that there are people starving in Kraaifontein and I had just thrown money away on this film. I am going to be adding a list of charities below, please, think of them before you spend a dime of your money seeing 'Cats' because doing so is basically paying good money to give yourself brain tumours."

I would carve my eyes out with a rusty spork before I would watch this movie again. When I left the theater I cried more out of shear terror than I did as a kid when my dog got hit after it escaped its leash and ran onto an active airplane landing strip. The amount of money it cost to get two tickets to this movie could be spent instead on a month of Regal Unlimited Subscription Pass.

1.0,13 December 2020,"Yes, I saw those kinda creepy trailers... no, I was never a fan of the Broadway musical... yes, I was prepared to watch the movie with my family and have a good laugh at it.

I did not expect to love the movie!

It wasn't just me either... I watched it with my children on Thanksgiving Day (12, 10 and 9) and they agreed... I wasn't just suffering some sort of delusion.

Yes, the CGI on the cat people could be disturbing at times... but once you got used to the whole idea of human faces with cat ears... most of the actors looked quite good.

The songs are mostly great... the performers voices are fantastic... the set pieces are imaginative (though the dancing cockroaches may have been a little too much)... the attention to detail is really quite impressive.

How on earth did this movie become so hated????

Taylor Swift's song is one of the best movie sequences of all time... and the Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer sequence isn't far off...and where else are you going to see a tap dancing cat?"

The CGI Cats looked awful and unsettling. What were they thinking?

It clearly had high production values behind it and the actors seemed to be trying, but my God this was easily one of the worst movies I've seen in 2019. However, I'm glad I made the effort to go and witness this Catastrophe. It truly is an awful movie you must see!

We lasted 35 minutes before walking out - the first walkout I've had since 1986!"
1.0,21 December 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. If you enjoyed the stage version, you will enjoy the movie. Go into it expecting an old-time singing and dancing musical, A new song and character have been added, and a little more story is included compared to the stage versions I saw. The dancing is wonderful. Francesca Hayward, is a joy to watch. For you tap fans, there is a glorious tap number to savor. Most of the singing is beautiful, and the other singing fits the character. There are even a few times when your heart/soul will be touched. It is not a perfect film. The editing/direction are not always helpful and some characters get more screen time then needed (Rebel Wilson does her typical over acting look at me routine). The negative reviews seem to focus on the thin plot and ""creepy"" looking cats. The plot of any song and dance movie/show is not designed to be complicated, it's designed to showcase the singing and dancing, which this plot actually does better than the stage versions I saw. The stage versions also had people dressed in cat costumes with cat ears and tails and makeup versions of cat faces and I never once saw a review that they were ""creepy"". The haters just seem to have no whimsy, wonder or serenity to allow themselves to just enjoy a movie because its fun. So, if you ever enjoyed seeing the stage version of Cats (or wished you had seen it and never did), like singing and dancing, or need a break from superheroes, science fiction and sequels, take friends and loved ones to see Cats. By the way, if you are a Taylor Swift fan, she does not appear until very late in the movie, so be patient."
3.0,31 July 2022,"Growing up watching the original on video, CATS always had a special place in my heart. My eldest has followed in my foot steps abd thoroughly enjoys a lot of films i grew up watching; lord of the dance, CATS, little mermaid etc.

So when i sat down to watch the new adaptation, especially after reading the large amount of negative reviews, i wasn't expecting much. Now first thing's first the CGI in places is questionable,odd and creepy, but putting that aside and focusing on the actual film, acting and talent, its really good. CATS is based on a book of poems about cats so dont know what people were expecting...its going to be weird and odd...its about cats. The talent and singing are great, Jennifer Hudsons version of memories was by far the most emotional song in the film and see preformed it superbly. Jason Derulo was another suprise with his acting and vocal range, i dont think jason derulo, Jennifer hudson or taylor swift got enough credit for their preforms and vocal skills. Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson i personally thought were show stealers with their vocals and acting they really held the film. Francesca Hayward did not by far get enough recognition for her dancing abilities at all which was a shame. Rebel Wilson surprised me with her vocals as well as i never realised how good she actually was (yes yes i know she's in pitch perfect) i personally just didn't realise her actual vocal range. James cordon was good as per usual and did have some good one liners that made me chuckle. I personally wish there had been more of a back story for Idris Elba's character and for that to have been explored more same goes for Jennifer Hudsons character as well. There are many more actors i could go on and talk about etc. The film its self i didnt find it smooth sailing to watch and got a bit lost here and there with some scenes i found that should have been long and some shorter. I think back stories had been missed and actually the Director could have maybe gone in a different direction whilst still keeping to the original show. CATs by far is not as bad as everyone has made out at all and the talent of the cast has not had nearly enough recognition that they deserved. Get over the CGI issue and actually sit down and enjoy the talened cast. I would advise to sit down, watch it,keep an open mind and make your own mind up. I dont believe it got a fair chance as it was already being criticised before it was released."

1.0,28 December 2019,"I think I needed something stronger for this movie, although I'm not even sure ayahuasca would have been enough to understand WTF was going on. I think the film was best summed up when my movie companion (who knew nothing about the musical) leaned over to me about a third of the way through, and asked what exactly it was all supposed to be about. I whispered that it was the eternal question of ""Cats"": what is it about and why does it even exist? The movie wasn't exactly terrible, but it was weird and discombobulating and creepy.

It then brings us back to the greatest unanswered question in musical theatre history: why was ""Cats"" so popular as a musical? The music isn't that great, with no story to speak of, so I think many people's fondness for the show is as much misty water-colored moments of nostalgia as it is praise for the show. It's just not objectively a great show, and what was novel (and a creepy) on stage becomes frightening rendered on the big screen. If you want to see for yourself, pop a few fistfuls of whatever you've got lying around and have a whirl. My head is still spinning from the experience. I hope I'm not scarred for life."

The great songs were blurred out by everything being super weird, and instead of spectacular dances that you expect in a musical it was just un-motivated and random theatrical dance moves. Yes, it probably wasn't totally random, but it didn't give me anything.

Lets not talk about how all the cats look like tiny, hairy people and you are wondering the entire movie if they are supposed to be cats or humans, why some are naked and some not, why they have human feet (but two guys wear shoes), and if they were actually going to eat mice with kids faces.

The movie missed the part about why people love musicals. If it had managed to be a great musical experience it should have been a pleasure to watch. Instead the focus is on bad cgi, weird looking cats, basically everything being weird and a bad storyline.

3.0,16 May 2021,"Polarizing it seems It revised the story, gave it a new viewpoint, a focal point of view that allowed it more of a sense of story than the stage show which is genuinely just a bunch of set pieces each with a self-contained story but with just the most cursory of narratives to set them within.

It doesn't matter because Cats on stage is a visual, visceral spectacle, a riot of musical cats and athletic dance with it's own unique aesthetic.

This was better, the addition of Victoria isn't just a good way to centre the film, Francesca Hayward's performance of her was really quite beautiful. Whenever she danced it stood out wonderfully against the overall dance style, it set her apart from the other ""cats"", which supported the narrative cleverly. Her face was quite exquisitely beautiful framed as it was by the CGI, but her facial expressiveness, that part of her acting was captivating.

How can folks hate this movie for the CGI? It added animated tails and yes.... fur. Have you looked at a cat? They actually don't wear technicolour leotards. Hating this film for the fur is like hating Aliens because the Xenos have flat asses, hating Star trek because you don't like the view out of the portholes. If you can't stand CGI for it's own sake then watch the film of the stage show, for pity's sake don't pretend you weren't expecting cat people.

Idris Elba did well, Judy dench was playing Judy Dench, Taylor Swift was just there for the musical number and it was a good performance - I like her better as a cat apparently. James cordon was awful and in future views of the movie I will be fast forwarding him but no surprises there. I thought Ian McKellen played age to the hilt but the character's style got lost to that. Rebel Wilson was not there to be cool or emotionally compelling and I thought played the part and the song she was given well. I wasn't keen on the part but there I take issue with Tom Holland, not Wilson.

Griselda and ""Memories"" have always been the highspot of Cats for me but Jennifer Hudson took it in a new direction and I really didn't appreciate the changes. Previosly as a character Griselda has a sorrowful magnificence, a beautiful sadness, it's the point the ""story"" seems to pivot on. Hudson plays her as fearful and the cast respond to her not with sadness and pity for her fall but with spite for her condition. ""Memories"" is performed with a little of the wistful loss, but with anger and it kills the whole character for me. When the chandelier rose into the clouds, for me it wasn't with that sense of joy and redemption, it was more of a ""well, that happened"".

The reviews here and elsewhere gathered a harsh and undeserved momentum, I'll be watching this movie again when I'm in the mood for dance."

1.0,19 March 2020,"There is nothing about this film that worked apart from the actors who tried their hardest to bring a bad idea to the screen. The CGI is awful and the film relies on it heavily. As for the music, it is destroyed by actors trying to portray the emotion of the story.

""Les Mis"" worked as it was a story that people could relate to, turned into a musical, and the film made the best of both. This is a collection of nonsense poems, that had no real theme or story except cats, that was turned into an award winning stage musical. To over-act the imagined emotion of a scene is to destroy the music. It should've been left on the stage. I hope I never hear ""jellicle"" ever again."

As another reviewer pointed out, this film ruins cinema, food, animals and quite possibly, your life. I have a cat at home, and I don't think I can ever look at it again.

The film had the promise to be a great film. The sets are there, and the photography is there, even the direction is there. What is missing is a sense of story, which has been completely lost in the way it has been edited.

Having seen the original production of Cats at the Drury Lane Theatre in London, when it first opened, I was looking forward to this film. I am very disappointed.

I can't recommend this film to anyone."
1.0,27 February 2020,"The only reason this review isn't 1/10 is because it has ONE good song and some of Rebel Wilson's moments were funny. Please excuse me now, I want to go and rethink my existance."
2.0,25 December 2019,"I wanted to like it and looked to excuse authors till the very end. But, after all I cannot even say whom this movie was targeted to. People who like and know the musical would be very disappointed and not just because it's ""not like a stage one"". The thing is that despite the unlimited cinema abilities it lacks a very simple thing - the sound. It simply does not sound well, very flat and lifeless even for a simple stereo, not even mentioning Dolby sound that it's supposed to have. Well, there are many questionable deviations but for god sake, what was the reason to make old Deuteronomy a non-signing elderly woman? I'm still trying to comprehend what kind of screwed logic the authors should have to make her whispering in the finale. So, who may like it? No idea? Perhaps people who never saw a good performance but generally like music and can open for themselves the world of musical theater."
10.0,24 December 2019,"Defintely, NOT a ""10""; nor would I give it a ""1"", as many others have given it. I'd give it a ""3"", or a ""4""-at the max. The songs and tunes are quite well known by now. The acting was hit-and-miss, depending upon who it was. The actress portraying ""Victoria"" did very well, even if some of the ""always protesting Alphabet crowd"" are aggrieved for being ""too white"" (actress is mixed race). ""Macavity"", ""Skimbelshanks"", ""Mistoffelees"", ""Munkustrap"" all did very well too. To the actor portraying ""Bustopher Jones""-well don't give up your day job selling Keurig coffee makers. As for Rebel Wilson as ""Jennyanydots, Lord help us all; if you've seen her in any movie, she's ALWAYS the same character in all-UGH! Judi ""M"" Dench as ""Old Deuteronomy"" and Ian McKellen as ""Gandalf"", oops ""Gus the Theatre Cat""-strange trying to hear them trying to sing. Taylor Swift, either you love her or you hate her. Jennifer Hudson as ""Grizabella"" sounded like a cat being strangled. As for the CGI makeup on the actors, ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" has had some creatures escape from the H. G. Wells' story. The human-faced mouses and the dancing cockroaches were beyond the EWW-factor. And as ""Forrest Gump"" would say, ""And that's all I'm going to say about that."""
7.0,25 December 2019,"I mean it's not life altering. In a good or a bad way. I didn't hate it, but then again, The Wiz was my favorite movie as a child."
1.0,27 December 2019,"I watched this film a day after the new version was pushed out. Although other elements of this film were still a bit boggling to the mind, the music more than compensated for them towards the end, such that I think this movie deserves at least a 6-hence my 9 in a vain effort to pull up the current average of 2.6. More people should watch this musical masterpiece."
3.0,23 April 2020,"I literally joined IMDB because of the mass of bizarre judgements passed against this movie. Usually, the mass of opinions washes out the nonsense, but, somehow, everyone in the world has decided to permit the vacuum of criticism to suck them in; they seem to be falling over each other to parrot one another's invective. Seriously? Perhaps someone needs to restate the obvious. This movie is a special-effects adaptation of a novel and innovative Broadway show. It IS the Broadway show. Cats is a musical built out of the quirky feline fantasy of T. S. Elliot. Perhaps the real problem here is that this is, deliberately and pointedly, NOT a story about humans. The only human in the show is a reprehensible scumbag who makes a cameo appearance. Why should the fantasy world of cats be like the grubby, complicated world of humans? Why judge the broadway musical with a cinematic rule book?

Many reviewers seem weirdly driven to find fault with the technical movie-making here: direction, cinematography and so forth. I'm sorry, but none of that was even close to the worst we've all seen -- and some of it was brilliant.

Some reviewers complained that it was ""full of heavy-weight stars"" who were, somehow wasted and not given enough to really demonstrate ""their stuff."" Again, how silly is that? The greatest performers are invisible: all you see is their character. I saw famous actors trying desperately to be T.S. Elliot's cats -- not Willy Loman or King Lear -- and be otherwise invisible. For the most part, it was fun and funny, and it worked.

I'll be the first to agree that the singing was a distraction, but the music and dancing was true to the show -- true to Webber's genius and what Broadway musicals are all about. The artistic settings and costuming, combined with the special effects, was nothing short of spectacular. So this wasn't a space war movie or ""The Terminator Meets Tom And Jerry."" It was a... I'll say it once more... a Broadway musical. It was every bit as entertaining as the actual stage musical -- and even more. To call it the worst movie you've ever seen is to admit that you need to get around a bit more and form some opinions of your own. I feel bad for y'all that you bungled an opportunity to let go and be entertained."
1.0,18 March 2020,I sound like cat when I sing so I should've bene in it but I'm glad I wasn't.
1.0,22 December 2019,"If I had know that this was a 'adaption' rather than a filmed version of the musical ""Cats"" I might not have taken my girlfriend to see it. Fortunately the restaurant afterwards was quite good. So I'm good with her. Through my judgement is suspect.

First, casting. Rebel Wilson and James Corden? Holy Crassness Batman! And Jennifer Hudson gave the worst performance I've ever heard from her. Did something happen to her voice? Do I need to say, Judi Dench can't sing.

But the worst problem was that just because they have CGI doesn't mean they had to use, and overuse, CGI.

The Lemon Chicken she ordered was to her liking, and my Mongolian Beef was excellent. That was the saving grace to the evening."
3.0,22 December 2019,"I've been a fan of Broadway shows for my entire life. Of course I'm always concerned when I see one being made into a Movie Version. Cats is certainly not one of my favorite shows, but I recognize that many people like it and I appreciate what it takes to bring it to life on stage. However, I felt so cheated after I bought my ticket to see this film adaptation. The singing and acting and dancing isn't really bad in my very humble opinion, but it just looks uncomfortable to watch. At first, I was some what impressed by the special effects to make the actors into ""cats"" but especially in closer shots, it just looks very weird to me. My other big problem with this movie is the same I have with the stage version: the plot is just bad and really kind of cheap. The only storyline that is at all interesting to me and really elicits emotion from me is the plot line of Grizabella. All the other cats lack a real motivation to root for them. Now I should say that I was absolutely blown away by Jennifer Hudson's Memory. She really truly did a truly fantastic and brilliant job with the song. The last fifteen minutes of the movie that includes her and her story again are actually very fascinating and present a rather compelling tale. Memory could definitely make seeing this movie worth it, but there's a lot of other stuff to sit through."
3.0,3 January 2020,
1.0,1 January 2020,"I refuse to classify it as a movie. IMDB should remove it from its database. How can we define something that's projected in to a white all as a movie? How should we categorize this one?

10.0,30 December 2019,It was such a nightmare! I swear I will see the reviews before I watch a movie!!
7.0,31 December 2019,I went to see Cats because I thought it might be amusingly bad. It's not. It's quite simply the worst film ever made.
1.0,27 December 2019,"I went to see this movie with low expectations since everybody dissed the movie so much, but I was so impressed. I actually loved the movie and is in my top movies of the year. The music and dance was amazing and stuck to the original story line so well. The only thing I didn't like was 'Mungojerry & Rumpleteaser's' song since it was different from the original. Everything else was amazing, and being a fan of the musical since I was little, I was in awe while watching it."
1.0,28 May 2021,"My most favorite musical is West Side Story. Great songs and story. Cats is in a different level on its own. Love the costumes and the set. I am not a cat person, but I did have a cat when I was a lot younger, and when it disappeared, I searched everywhere and found her in the middle of the road, lifeless. Cried that day. This Cat story had a great cast and ensemble. The story was not as appealing for my taste. But it is still very watchable if you have the time."
1.0,27 December 2019,"22 years ago, in The Man Who Knew Too Little, lord Bill Murray said Cats... with people, and here we go.

It was... a challenge to watch it till the end. It's outstandingly boring. The music is forgettable, the lyrics usually repeat the same line 8 times, the dancing is uncreative and there is next to no emotion. I don't really have a problem with the way the cats look, but production design as a whole falls a bit flat, all locals are generic, and cinematography is generally about slow pans for minutes on end, which just boosts the boredom further.

The gimmick, of everyone being a cat, becomes pointless already a few minutes in, and while the actors themselves look quite impressive most of the time, there are (quite many, honestly) bad looking CGIs (a CGI water scene in particular completely got me off guard with its badness).

The movie fails in its visuals to get away with just being an artsy flick, the music completely fails to touch you (as opposed to other recent musicals like La La Land) and generally it just comes across as a seemingly endless barrage of bad, almost nonsensical music videos which play one after the other with just a few seconds of pause in between.

The good? Uhm, ... A for effort? I mean, they got the cat look right, from a technical standpoint... and Taylor Swift actually did not deliver a performance so hitty you will remember it for decades, like most female singers manage to do in their cinema debuts. Actors overall really look similar to the originals, surprisingly. But it really doesn't save much and effort can only get you so far if the idea itself is destined to be hated.

I would like to believe there is a certain set of people who'd enjoy this, maybe people who saw the original musical and are somehow attached to the songs because they were presented to the viewers in a more enticing manner. But that's, if at all, a very tiny percentage of your general audience.

It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, probably wouldn't even make the top 50, but it just might be the worst movie I've ever seen on the big screen.

Add: I saw this film in Germany and all songs were dubbed in German. That's not cool, you don't get someone like e.g. Taylor Swift and then redub the whole thing..."
4.0,30 December 2019,
1.0,18 March 2020,What is this movie. 1h15 out of the 2h is just a presentation of every cat in a song. This movie could have been 20 minutes and we wouldn't have miss any part of the storyline because the storyline could fit on a post-it. Why did all these actors agreed to be compromised in this is beyond me. How did a movie with such bad CGI ever see the light of day is a tragedy in itself. The expectations where high for Tom Hopper after Les Misérables but this is not just disappointing it's insulting. The movie was not ready and it showed. Felt botched and it's disrespectful for the audiences and the original work.
1.0,10 October 2020,"There is so much going on and none of it is good. I will say that the filmmakers had a vision and they went for it, charging through the door, head first, they really put it all on the line. Unfortunately, no one stopped the ask the question ""is this bad?"". I wish I could give it more than one star but I just can't, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1.0,4 January 2020,"This movie is easily the worst I've ever seen. As the movie progressed I realized that the now seemingly quick 2 hours of the movie was not going to be the last I saw of these terrible cats, and after my particularly awful episode of night terrors last night I can confirm that I was correct. I would rather carve my eyes out with a rusty spork than watch this movie again. I cried more or of shear horror when I left the theater than when my dog died in my childhood. Seriously don't waste your money on this atrocity of a movie, the money spent on two tickets to cats you could instead be used to get a month of the regal unlimited movie pass, where you get to watch as many movies as you like. With great benefits like 10% off any Food or non alcoholic drink and getting to see movies before everyone else in regal screenings, its just stupid not to sign up today! 5/5"

1.0,20 December 2019,"Phenomenal performance by all the actors/dancers and singers. It is so important to see ""Cats"" for yourself and not to be put off by adverse hype! I have seen the stage musical twice and remembered the fantastic songs and wonderful story line. This film is by far a beautiful and exquisite version of ""Cats"".Andrew Lloyd Webber has written amazing songs which are all memorable and completely entertaining. Bravo 10 out of 10 !"
3.0,2 September 2021,"Just so you know, I was young when Cats was a big thing. And I have had my moments on the stage myself, so maybe I am biased and sentimental.

In the early 80s I saw the show in London, and was not that impressed but played the record a lot. In short, this movie brought tears of joy and feeling good to my eyes. And that is not common. A good tragedy and a good show has been made despite a really strange material to start with. I mean, it is just a heap of silly rhymes, but the script writing made it to a story. The music is fantastic. Young and skilled dancers. The lead actress enchanting and all of the others doing very well. That was enough to convince me. I will most likely watch it again."

1.0,21 December 2019,I never read reviews before watching a film as I make my own mind up after watching although I didnt have much choice with this as 90% were saying it was total rubbish.

My advise if your in two minds go watch it and make your own mind up

10.0,6 January 2020,
6.0,25 December 2019,"There is so much to process with ""Cats"" but the biggest question I have is What on Earth were they Thinking? As a fan of musical theatre I've always been familiar with ""Cats"" but honestly I've never had a desire to view it on stage. It just sounded like an odd experience, people also forget just how odd the idea is anyway, that said I don't know how much this truly connects to the original stage production. Having said that, the choices made in this film are so bizarre. The CGI people/cat hybrid is one of the most horrible decisions I've ever seen, they should have fully animated this or committed to makeup, because WOW it's just so off-putting. The movie is also oddly horny and doesn't really contain a plot structure, it's more like HERES THIS CAT AND HERES THERE SONG, which can work on stage but not in a feature film. This is quite odd because Todd Hooper is a good filmmaker and it just boggles my mind as to why he would make this. Despite all of this, the cast is talented, the music is really well done, and the set design is really impressive, but that doesn't really help the film at all. Despite all of this it's a true marvel of a film and I highly suggest it be viewed!"
5.0,4 June 2020,I delayed watching this film after the wretched reviews.Sometimes the Critics can be so wrong.
2.0,9 April 2020,"The haters are gonna hate. People have hated on CATS ever since it premiered on Broadway in the 70's...nothing new here. The cast was good, the choreography was great as were the incredible sets and staging...well, then there's the fantastic the ALW music, not to mention the source material from TS Elliott, no less. These are the good points. Throughout artistic endeavors humans have anthropomorphized animals, it's not easy and the result is subjective. I suspect that this is the crux of the bad reviews and the critics panning of the movie. Such an endeavor is certainly amorphous, but the outcome is not unwatchable. The costumes are well constructed and the choice to interpret the combining of humans and cats was up to the creative team. Even the stage cast had their own hands and feet, which seemed to cause consternation among the masses. The weakness in my opinion was some of the casting, especially Jennifer Hudson and Judy Dench. Finally, I did love the dialogue which added context to the music."
3.0,27 December 2019,
2.0,4 January 2020,"So wow... I just can't put into words how abysmal this is. I would first like to say before embarking on my review that I've never seen the stage production. Now that being said pretty much nothing worked in this film and honestly I'm just not sure whose fault it was. From a base level the story and songs confused me and weren't very engaging. The cgi and makeup and costuming or combination were really off putting and nightmarish at moments. At times it looked as though there faces were floating and coming out of the screen like Renesme from Breaking Dawn. I'm not blaming any of the actors here accept the lead was lackluster and Jason Derulo was bad. Rebel Wilson was kind of funny, Taylor Swift was amusing and charismatic but Jennifer Hudson actually was pretty damn good. She gave me chills and made me tear up at the end even though I hated the movie. And I did hate the movie but am really just confused by it. It looks as though they really tried their best. I really think it was just unfilmable. Like the so called live action Lion King last year it's something that may only have worked in cartoon form and most certainly the stage play because it was so successful which the movie is not. Definitely one of the worst of 2019."
5.0,20 December 2019,"It's obviously that the biggest downside to this movie adapted musical, is the CG, the cats look so hideous to look at, and it just look so uncanny and it hit the bottom of the uncanny valley.

It's no wonder this movie have the lowest rating, but it could be better, if the CG doesn't look like something from a David Lynch movie."

4.0,7 January 2020,"I have seen the stage production and was really not impressed, I found it tedious in the extreme, but for me this was far better. For all the one star reviews that claim there is no plot, all I can say is you need to keep your eyes and ears open. You have to remember that Cats is based on a collection of poems and the plot is very simple. The acting is very simple because they are humans trying to be cats, not cats trying to be human. The dancing is superb,I liked the special effects and staging, the singing is ok most of the time, and the rendition of ""Memory"" is excellent. You have to realise that actors can rarely sing and dance and visa versa. Cats is a fantasy set to music and if you loved the stage version, then this is very little different. I really can't understand all the negativity about it, but then I find there is a section of people that will moan about any film you put up, no matter what it is, and as for film critics..... I never take any notice of those."
5.0,30 October 2021,"I love the Broadway play ""Cats"" by Andrew Lloyd Webber based on TS Eliot 1939 poetry. I'm sorry for anybody who's not informed that it is a musical piece and not a story. Like some ballet and other dance there is no story to Cats! Try to get over that. ""All art must have a story if it has a collection of songs."" Think of how ridiculous that opinion is. Someone compared it to Nutcracker as music not story. Cats is a fantastic production when well done. As a person who loves the play, I don't know what to think of this movie. It doesn't feel as good as the play. It doesn't feel like good acting that was filmed. It's more about production effects than the music and dance. If you love musical theater or you want to expose children to musical theater, I would not suggest starting with this. But for the low cost of viewing if somebody likes watching this it's a bunch of cats running around along with some rodents and insects. Compared to the production I saw in San Diego, the songs are unfeeling. They are very professional. They are very on key. They are very produced. Somebody glued all the pieces of the songs together. 👉 I am starting to like something about this. They've been careful to focus on the lyrics being enunciated. Next time I see the play Cars the songs will be more clear to me. Now that I've gotten over the extreme production I'm getting to really appreciate getting to hear the lyrics. There is no story to cats but I guess they've created a story around some sort of competition. Ian McKellen is fantastic. He makes a better statement about this movie within the movie than any of our reviews. OK now it's really beginning to drag. The play was never a drag. Sadly I'm saying this is Taylor Swift is coming down on the stage. If she did this exact thing in the middle of one of her shows I would be entertained by it. But at this point, I'm just getting really tired of watching the overproduced cats. But it's music and your kids might like watching cats move around for a couple hours. And this is appropriate for kids by the way. I saw comments on the Internet about seeing crotches Nothing is close to exposure and anybody who watches ballet or dance looking to see what they can see is of course being juvenile. But that is a human behavior."

The performances are great, the choreography is great, the sets and lighting are great, the CG human-cat hybrids are a nightmare. The use of the original actors eyes, nose and mouth mixed with CG fur doesn't work. The fur can often be seen moving around the actors faces making it look like the face isn't attached to the body. I feel sorry for all the creatives involved because other than the CG this could have been a great film. It's hard to see the performances through the surreal nightmare."

The horrible thing is that its based on a popular musical with obvioulsy lovely songs but the songs dont make an impact in this movie because of the direction and messy art direction. The songs are the essence of cats. Also the beautiful >catlike< choreography of the stage production - but unfortunately it was replaced by some not so catlike dance numbers. theres no charm, no life in this film!!

the acting of jason derulo, taylor swift and the others is fun to watch, what ian mckellen s part was that i still dont undersand - his >performance< was abyssal. Jennifer Hudsons acting was on par but her singing war just like mc kellens shtick, simply terrible - what had been a beautiful moment of the stage production of cats was here a cringworthy tear jerk.

The singing was FANTASTIC! Dancing fantastic! Every single role was ferfect! Jennifer Hudson give new dimension singing Memory. I am not fan of Taylor Swift, but she was fantastic! James Corden, ah this role is made for him. Rebel Wilson - fantastic! I really don't understand what made people write so many bad opinion.

There were characters played well by great actors who could not sing. The plot was thin of you just look at from point A to B, without looking at its meaning. Hint: it's not about cats, but about us. But the movie actually made what was happening much clearer to the audience . Outside of the few who acted well, but could not sing, the entertainment value, the singing and dancing and the music by Andrew Lloyd Weber was fantastic! The acting, singing and dancing by lead Francesca Hayward was phenomenal. Most of music and dancing were very good. The tap dancer was excellent! At the end I was moved. They could have done with the last treatise on how to treat cats. Were there flaws.? Yes. Similar flaws were in the hit stage production. The virtual costumes admittedly turned me off at first. But I got used to it and I found it genuinely entertaining and moving despite that. Perhaps others spent too much time being literal and missed the heart of it. Or perhaps they could get past the ""costumes"". The difference in shoes had to do with the type of dancing being done. The white tennis shoes did bug me until I saw the dance being performed. I wanted the give it more stars based on overall enjoyment of it, but aforementioned flaws caused me to have to go with 6. I did enjoy it!"
5.0,12 October 2020,"Make no mistake, this movie is absolutely bananas. It has a lot of heart tho. It's true failing is that it can bore at times. That said, what were people expecting from a show that starts with literally the dumbest song in the English language and I'm including Chumbawumba's song from the 90's? ""Jellicle Cats"" is SUCH a stupid number that I would not be surprised to hear that it had provoked seizures in a large number of people. Not entirely certain I didn't have a seizure myself."
1.0,28 December 2019,"I went into the film expecting it to not be as good as the stage show but still at least be watchable. I was wrong. They manufactured a plot, changed songs, changed characters, etc.

The choreography was nice enough to watch but not enough to carry the film. The one and only good part was Jennifer Hudson's rendition of ""Memories"". She put heart and soul into an otherwise dead film."
1.0,23 May 2020,"My five year old daughter, quite bluntly summed it up with ""this should end now"" just about 15 minutes into the movie. There is so much wrong with this movie that I will not go into the details, but the saddest thing is that they should have been obvious. However I will not go down the path of rating this car crash of a production with only one star because I have seen way worse. I have not been able to keep watching most movies that recieved less then 3 stars here on IMBD - this however I (we) could bear to the end - where there is actually some good singing - which pretty much most of the movie can't actually manage. No we do not want to see this again and yes, curiosity was mostly what kept us going - but there are movies out there that get higher ratings than this where I would rather bash my head onto the table than keep watching. This movie is very dissapointing and a sad waste of some great effort - but it did not make me want to hurt myself."
1.0,18 January 2020,"This is supposed to be a piece of entertainment, and it kind of is, there are some nice songs and nice dance scenes there. However, the message that this movie sends is unacceptable. First of all, I cannot see much artistic message in it. But secondly, and most importantly, it's very discriminatory. Why is Macavity black? So we have basically every other actor in the movie white except the villain Macavity, and the rather weak and troubled Grizabella, who just seeks acceptance of others, and who needs to be saved. That's a racist message. It's racism at the subconscious level, sort of portraying it as if the things are ""normal"" that way. And then on top of that, look at how Jennyanydots is portrayed. They are simply making fun of her and showing her as clumsy because she's overweight. So it's immediately stereotyping and making fun of overweight people, which is unacceptable"
1.0,17 August 2020,"I'll give people; it's seriously strange, and the effects between cat and human are super uncanny. But it's actually not as bad as everyone says on here. Tone down the expectations and just expect to be entertained."
10.0,19 April 2020,Is just a cheap copy of the actual play. Many song could have been remastered for a better bit. I little more dialog would be better. Such a waste of talent

1.0,1 January 2020,Don't listen to the other reviews this film was one of the best musical films i have ever watched
1.0,6 March 2020,"I had such hopes for this - I love Cats the Musical and Tom Hooper had done such a fantastic job with Les Miserables. How wrong could I be!! I had read the reviews and figured I'd make my own mind up, the reviewers couldn't have been fans after all (right?) It's terrible, I mean REALLY terrible. Don't, just don't - and if you do, don't say I didn't warn you. The 1998 filmed stage production is so much better than this..I am now off to try and erase this from my mind."
1.0,30 December 2021,"It's strange how critics attacked this movie... No wonder, but it's far from as horrible as they claim.

Certain musical numbers extrapolate, the effects are silly, choreographies, mainly of the main actress forcing ballet steps, which go against the idea of the film.

However, overall I thought it was an average movie... Good fun.

Don't believe in such low grades. I have certainly seen much worse things that have had more benevolence from critics."
2.0,27 December 2019,"If you look at their feet at any point in the movie it never looks like they're touching the floor. The cgi is so bad and so disturbing to look at. James Cordens head looks like it moves separately from his body. Every cat is naked but Idris Elba is somehow more naked. The scene at the end that is 5 straight minutes of Judy dench staring directly at the camera is so unnerving. I'm certain none of the producers know what size a cat is. All the cats look like they want to have fun with each other at all times. I watched the whole movie and can tell you nothing of the plot.

All that being said, if you drink and watch this movie it's so fun to behold"
1.0,1 November 2020,I honestly don't get the hate. I only knew some info about the stage play and this is exactly why I expected. IDK if most people just didn't know what this was gonna be? It isn't a great musical. But there are definitely worse movies out there
1.0,26 December 2023,"I read and laughed loudly at some of the rotten reviews and curiosity got the better of me...

I grew up in Edinburgh, so have seen my fair share of random Fringe shows- you take the flyer, a gamble and agree to endure whatever bafflement is thrown at you- it's part of the fun!

Cats is one of those Fringe shows, don't try to understand, just give yourself over to the randomness and embrace it!

It's really not that bad, there a some excellent singers, Taylor is smoking as Bombalurina and it's as close to a waking fever dream as you are likely to experience. However the indisputable highlight is Sir Ian McKellan's 'Miawah, wah wah, wah' at 42 minutes in, it's worth the rental fee alone!!"
4.0,19 April 2021,Yeah I still don't have an answer. This was definitely a movie. There were people in this movie.
10.0,14 July 2021,"It is not a masterpiece, it doesn't make much sense and most scenes are just too ridiculous and convoluted to appeal a wide audience but, come on people, it's a musical about cats having a party to decide who goes to the ""afterlife""... it sure is no Citizen Kane but in order to enjoy it you have to put your rational mind aside."
7.0,25 December 2019,"Should never have gone to the big screen, directionless and after 110 mins still none the wiser as to what, where and why. Should have gone to Netflix or Amazon Prime as a guilty pleasure watch."
1.0,21 July 2023,"Horrible film. The AI is so so bad that I cannot truly understand how these A list celebrities accepted to participate in something like this. Plus, there are some actors whose voice was not great for a musical which is the case for Taylor Swift - she's extremely talented but this definitely didn't do any justice to her. I don't know if the movie was supposed to be a horror one, but that's the feeling I got. It's really really bad and I'm glad I didn't pay any money to see it, otherwise I'd be extremely frustrated to have contributed to this project. Hope they dont make the same mistake never again."
3.0,25 December 2019,"This film was exactly what I expected. The costumes, sets and make-up were terrific, the visual effects were decent and Jennifer Hudson owned ""Memory."" Judi Dench was spectacular as always, saying everything with her eyes. I loved Ian McKellan's limited role. The rest was difficult to endure: long, drawn-out production numbers of very cheesy Broadway tunes, Jason Derulo's horrible singing, Taylor Swift's even worse singing (and getting A-list billing,) James Corden's unfunny performance and Rebel Wilson inability to keep her legs closed. Overall, the first half was very rough, but the movie was saved by Hudson, Dench, McKellan and the marvelous eye candy."
5.0,21 July 2020,"I don't understand why everybody hate this movie. All the stars in this movie is fantastic. I love the songs and i love Cats and musicals, it is a amazing well done movie. I LOVE IT"
1.0,25 January 2020,"I honestly cannot think of any one way or thing that could've made this any worse.. actually, if you took out the cgi and just left the green screens and ping pong balls I guess visually it could have been worse...idk, lemme think on that one.. P.s. isn't there a test screening to avoid abominations like this being released E.g. Sonic The Hedgehog??"
1.0,21 May 2024,"I don't understand why this has so much negative feedback. I think this was a decent attempt to convert a stage show to the screen.

I've seen Cats stage show a few times and enjoyed the music and this conversion to the big screen.

Some nice effects moments, yes some slow moments too but overall I liked it.

This in my opinion is just a different way to enjoy the music from the show in a new visual way.

I was put off watching it for a while because of the comments but glad I gave it a watch when I fancied reliving the songs one day.

If you love the stage show it's worth a watch as the songs are timeless."
1.0,22 December 2019,Boy this is bad but it is definitely something different. Its a trip and even though it is definitely terrible I feel like it is something that you should give a shot if you are looking for something different to watch with friends.

1.0,30 January 2020,"Do not under any circumstances go pay for this movie, if you're still interested and would like to illegally download it, don't do that either! If you happen upon this movie in a Redbox in the future, pass it up. If you see it on Amazon for Free? Do not press play! It's basically like watching the Ring. You watch in Terror and then at the very end you hear a phone ring and someone on the other end says... You will die in 7 days..."
10.0,1 July 2021,"Ok, Cats is not everyone's favourite musical. It never has been and never will be, but all those people scoring it just a one! Come on people, give credit where it is due. Jennifer Hudson can sing, but maybe her rendition of 'Memory' this time round was not the best. Idris Elba was spot on as McAvity, and Taylor Swift linked up nicely with him for their number. But the showstopper was Skimbleshanks... making it a tap dance, worked so well, and the whole dance crew joined in to make this a memorable routine. And I quite liked James Corden's number: visually it worked beautifully.

OK the sets were not great, but I have yet to see a production of Cats where it has been good. It's just that type of show. And Francesca Hayward was charming and beautiful to watch throughout. Nobody seemed to notice these things. It's still worth watching and with a cast like this, yes, definitely!"
6.0,27 April 2020,"I beg anyone out there to please don't ever watch this movie. Its a complete disaster in the movie industry and a very good example on how to not ever make a movie like this. It was cringe worthy, annoying, boring & obviously the lamest and the dumbest movie ever made. Its traumatic !!"
1.0,20 June 2021,Watching this now on HBO. It's hard to watch. It's just so bad. Cringe.
1.0,8 September 2021,"I heard this story of this English teacher who was a big fan of the stage musical Cats. For days she was excited when this film was about to come out. The day after she announced that she was finally going to have a chance to see it, she came to class pale and emotionless. When students asked her what was wrong (and students hardly ever ask a question like that) she said, she has not slept well. The movie was so bad that she cried the whole night through.

It is hard to fathom how a classic like a world success musical can be turned into this film. It makes me wonder what studio executives are doing. How could they release it the way it is?

Werner Herzog once said, film students should not only watch good films. They should also watch movies that are awful to analyze what went wrong in order to avoid making the same mistakes. This 100 mio dollar effort would be among the top ten on my list."
5.0,8 July 2021,"A couple of bits were ok, you could tell it was straight from the stage show.

It was cringe, James Corden, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson and poor Ray winstone.

Best character was Gus (sir Ian) only because he reminded me of my elderly cat!

So glad I did not pay to see this in the cinema, and normally I don't pay that much attention to critics, but in this case they were right.

The director/producer were obviously having a bad week/year for allowing this to be released. (Was this before Covid?)"
1.0,4 April 2022,"This film is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs. I lasted about 15 minutes before throwing up in the toilet. I tried to watch another 5 minutes, but I slowly began to pass out."

2.0,15 May 2021,"I have to admit, I do not understand how everyone hates this movie. I'm not quite saying that this is a gem, but despite some issues, it's actually quite an alright movie!

First, there's a point, some kind of message simplistic as it might be, which is more than I can say for most movies of the current decade. Second, the cast can actually sing, and dance. Which has most certainly not been the case with some of the most popular musicals of the recent era (La La Land comes to mind).

And while I'm sure the cat costumes were not for everyone, I don't believe the ratings here in any way reflect the quality of the movie."
5.0,5 April 2021,There's no way that all the people involved with this movie weren't laughing their butts off during production. The fact that this is a full fledged movie with a budget makes it that much more odd.
2.0,18 January 2020,"Please shutdown you're eyes and listen to the wonderful music it gives you...please don't open it, i said DONT open your eyes......pfff to late, this is your own fault then, so badly written and so sad to see, please the cgi on this thrown me back to the 70's and the 70's had some good cgi...so please don't watch it, you'll getting depressed with this for sure, can't even say a good word for this really."

Honestly I just don't get it. Nothing of it. I really don't understand the plot at all and what all this is about.

The costumes really looks great and the music and songs are good too... I just don't understand it and I wouldn't say it's my fault when reading others critics here."
1.0,12 March 2022,"This would be it! This is is the Plan 9 from outer space of the 2000s. It's like watching a train wreck, it's so bad, you want to look away but you can't."

1.0,8 January 2020,"As a musical theatre lover I approached this movie with trepidation taking the reviews. Yes, some of the casting was questionable, (step forward Rebel Wilson and Ray Winstone) but the stage stalwarts were a pleasure to watch and listen to. Idris Elba was suitably evil and Judy Dench was, well Judy Dench. If you expect a stage show go to the theatre. Film is never going to match it. Although not brilliant I was entertained and the 2 hours passed quickly."
1.0,22 January 2021,"Saw the show in London in 1990 and had been waiting for the movie ever since. Love sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, and cats is remarkable."
2.0,22 April 2020,"It is crazy the visceral reaction to this, a delightful light-hearted musical. I mean if you're expecting 'Inherit the Wind' then obviously you're going to be somewhat disappointed. It's a musical fantasy about the life of cats. Do you not realize that going in? I saw the musical years back on stage twice. I very much enjoyed the movie, probably prefer it from the stage version."
4.0,2 March 2022,"Literally the worst musical adaptation of a great live musical to be put to film! All round bad, absolutely terrible! Some musicals aren't meant to be in a live film production, and this is the upmost example."
8.0,18 June 2022,"The music is the only good thing about this movie... but then again, it's the original music. All the beauty in the characters, the settings, the costumes, the choreography, the feelings conveyed by the original cast and production are totally absent in this 2019 version. Whoever had the idea of turning one of the most beautiful, touching musicals into this horrific semi animated ""thing"" should go back to anime or find a new career. I found it impossible to relate to any of the characters, even acknowledging how talented many in the cast actually are. The expression on the faces of the actors is completely distorted by the ridiculous effects used.

I would love to see a new version with real person like cats!"
7.0,10 July 2022,"Cats, one of the most infamous horror movie of 2019. Has some great songs and beautiful musical source material but wasted any chances of being one of the best musical Broadway adaptions. With it's cringey performances, bad one liners, and creepy CGI cats look, the film is already doomed."
1.0,12 April 2020,"I'd heard all the bad things, but like when they say don't press the red button. You do it just to see it for yourself and I can confidently say - curiosity killed the cat. As everyone's said the size of the cats are more like tiny mice. The weird human faces, feet and hands. I've never taken mushrooms but this is surely what you can expect if you took mushrooms in a cattery. And Jennifer Hudson over singe Memory which is usually a song I love. Watch only if you want to purely gasp in pure bemusement for 1.5hr."
4.0,16 December 2021,"I thought that with enough whiskey and enough to smoke, (plus being bored out of my mind one night), I could give this a try; because the very least, it should provide some laughs with how horrible it is, right? We all know everything seems funnier when cross-faded.

Wrong. I couldn't even last the first 5 minutes. Straight out of the door with the first song, it makes no sense, and the singing literally sounds like my own actual cats yowling. I just turned off the t.v and watched my cats sleep, and that made for better viewing then this movie.

This movie is going down in infamy as one of the worst ever."
3.0,28 September 2020,"When I watched it with my friend, we thought that we could laugh at the poor CGI and the story, but what I watched was the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot was incredibly boring, and it really just should've stayed on Broadway. I had no idea who the characters were. The whole play was to introduce the characters. You sincerely messed up."
5.0,18 November 2021,"IF YOU LOVE THE STAGE PLAY DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!! They totally screwed up with this one. Even Dame Judi Dench or Sir Ian McKellen couldn't fix it. So far the worst song is Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer. It's lost all beat and rhythm. I absolutely adored to original and had high hopes for this, thinking they couldn't screw up anything by the master Andrew Lloyd Webber. How did they lose their way THIS badly!? Even the singing was off.. I have nothing good to say about this."
1.0,21 March 2022,"It is like the film reel was coughed up and covered in fur by an ignorant feline that should been ignored period.

2.0,22 January 2020,"I am not a steady user reviewer in IMDB. But felt the need to review this one. As most of us, before going to watch it, I checked the rating and reviews in IMDB. Wow, how many horrible reviews it has received. So, I went there, prepared to watch one of the worst films I have ever tried.

This was not the case though. The film is not the average ""Hollywood"" musical with a blend of dialogues and songs. It is almost just songs. Be prepared for that. I have not seen the theatre play, so I cannot compare. But found this film quite good. It is not a fast paced movie. It is not intended to. After the half , it becomes more emotional and captivating. I think the movie delivers what it is intended to: a ""theatrical"" experience of a musical. Relying more on the music and lyrics, than complex dialogues, to transfer the ideas and emotions to the viewer. Succeeded with me."
1.0,11 January 2020,"Non-existent plot, painfully long and distasteful songs. Almost no dialogue. Just an overall disaster that's one hour and fourty-nine minutes long after which my brain feels like it has been fried. This is probably material for torture."

1.0,1 September 2021,Wow this is bad. Ok what the actually hill is the cgi? It looks like litter. And the singing is actually quite terrible. So bad in fact that I had to mute my TV a couple times. Get a group of really funny and annoying people to watch this with. I wish I had.
5.0,11 October 2020,"I saw this on stage many years ago and it put me to sleep, cats dancing with no music, stage lighting was dark, I didn't get it. Thankfully I didn't see this film in the movie theater, I just caught it on HBO MAX so was able to fast forward quite a bit. I would have walked out of the theater - I didn't find any interesting parts. Wow, an overall rating of 2.3 - never have I seen anything rated so low, but it is deserved. Sadly."
1.0,7 August 2021,Terrible movie but skimbleshanks slaps from beginning to end.
1.0,1 January 2022,"Having never seen the Cats Broadway show or heard much about the story I can't comment on how close this movie ""Cats"" (2019) is to the original story wise. As is the story is a string of episodic music numbers with a main plot that doesn't quite come together (what is the ""jellicle choice""?). However there is a basic enough plot that doesn't need much explanation such as ""the introduction of the new girl"" or ""the outcast who wants to be let back in."" When the movie follows these through lines there is clarity and a potent feeling as Jennifer Hudson wistfully singing ""Memory"" evokes. Strong commendation for her performance even though why exactly she is outcast remains unclear even as it sounds like it did in the original.

""Cats"" has a strong cast, but it's mostly the actors who aren't the headline names who take the show such as the actress (a ballerina in real life"" playing Victoria. I rather think ""Cats"" is too star studded as the actors have scenes that don't necessarily add to the story such as Rebel Wilson's always funny but extraneous antics.

The effects are all around bizarre mostly as faces don't seem to move in sync either with the bodies or the cat ears which often seem to act in odd ways without any anatomy or musculature. Costumes are distracting because some distinctly lack body parts while others look more like bodies in leotards.

However overall the color direction is vivid, the sets are artistically done, and the music is as you might expect.

Whatever ""Cats"" got Disney's CGI live action ""The Lion King"" also released in 2019 deserved much worse and that won some Oscars aside! At least there was some attempt at adaptation and innovation instead of straight out wooden and lifeless copying."
1.0,18 January 2023,"I've never really been a cat person. All jokes aside, I didn't like the musical, so I'm not shocked I didn't like this movie; but I feel like this could have had a better shot at not being completely audience-alienating had this been animated. The costume design and production design really repulsed me and made it incredibly hard to enjoy any part of watching this movie.

I do actually really like ""Beautiful Ghosts"" and ""Memory"" so I'll keep them. Jennifer Hudson is a treasure, as are Jason Derulo, Ian McKellan, Judi Dench, and Taylor Swift. It's a talented cast on the whole and they're doing their best with a strange collection of stories. Honestly though, that's why despite liking the cast and a few songs, I feel like everything else in this jellicle production can go straight to jellicle hell."

2.0,4 January 2021,"The campaign agains this film was probably one of the most successful. The trailer was horrifying. The final product however is actually pretty palatable.

Considering there are top tier talents in the cast it was an uphill battle to completely bomb this film. Jennifer Hudson is a powerhouse. How can you escape this performance as anything but exceptional.

The special effects are the main issue - and even when you get your head around them, the key issue is the human face on a cat head + body with only an attempt to 'blend' them together. This and the silhouettes of the 'naked' cats is just jarring. The cats that work are those that are draped in coats or clothing.

Is it the greatest musical / film? No. But it's not that bad. It's ok. If you like the musical it's fine. It's worth it just for the top tier performances."
10.0,25 July 2021,"I grew up on the 1998 recorded Cats show.

This... this was an absolute abomination of cinema. The music was hollow, flat, and horribly dissonant and out of harmony. Visually it was jarring and messy. The ""dances"" were... dull to say the least, hardly anything of note. The less said about the CGI... ""costumes"" the better. For some reason, there's a contrived plotline.

I hope to never see this movie again."

Anyway I hope she is doing well, she was nice up until that night. But my god this movie really set a new tone for 'movie', 'musical' and 'friend'."
2.0,6 September 2021,"Tom Hooper needs to stop.

There needs to be a Gofund me page or something to ensure he never directs another musical. I think he is to musicals as the author of Pride Prejudice and Zombies is to classics.

1.0,21 September 2020,"The thing is, if you put world-classic actors in a popular musical (Ian McCallen and Judy Dench) but orchestrate the music poorly, then the movie ends up nothing more than a highfive into the face with a brick. I've been listening to, living and breathing this musical since I was 1,5 half years old (that's more than 20 years) and I am confident to say that I wouldn't have had any problem with shaping this to the eye/ear/taste of the young generation, but this is simply bad. I hope Webber got paid for it really well, because if I were him I would have never let this movie spread. Nothing beats the 1998 version. NOTHING."

1.0,18 October 2020,"Many one-star reviewers seem not to haveany arguments in their reviews, so here is a more motivated one... I have long been a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, ever since I saw Jesus Christ Superstar on stage in London. Evita and Cats were logical follow-ups in style and music. This film has a lot of faults, but a few redeeming features as well. The faults: 1. The cats look creepy, all facial expressions seem to be weird and unnatural. 2. Nobody seems to be able to sing properly, not even Jennifer Hudson. In a musical/opera you'd expect people to be able to sing, as that's the the essence of the art form. 3. The choreography makes no sense at all and just adds to the creepiness of it all. 4. Inserted spoken dialogues trying tonadd more of a storyline to the musical are unnecessary. The redeeming feature of the film is the decor, which looks astonishing, along with the lighting. In sum, not as bad as a one-star, but not enough to entertain me. 3."

I grew up having gone to the musical in-person three times and watched the 1998 video on repeat when it was released. This is truly not a bad rendition of the musical. Where they failed, was trying to add comedic relief with Rebel Wilson and James Corden. It was unnecessary, took away from the songs and didn't add to the movie at all. I was let down by some of the renditions of my favorite characters (Rum Tum Tugger, Mungojerrie & Rumpleteazer), but was impressed with Jennifer Hudson's Memory!"
1.0,27 February 2024,"As a viewer, you have a MORAL duty to never pay a cent for this crime against humanity. Watch free YouTube reviews of this abomination -- watch every last one of them, many are quite hilarious. But don't ever watch the movie itself, not even for free. Yes, it's really THAT offensive.

How anyone in the world thought this hideousness was worth putting investment money into, I'll never comprehend. I hope that empires toppled over such moronic decision-making.

Tom Hooper, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson -- I hope you'll wear the shame of this monstrosity around your necks until the day you die. You are the literal worst!

I'd give it 0/10 if I could."
10.0,11 October 2020,"No, it's not any good. I didn't know what was going on most of the time. I don't know how they got half of the cast to even be in it. But I didn't hate it. And I might be a furry now.

And damn, Jennifer Hudson's performance of ""Memory"" is incredible. I legitimately got choked up."
7.0,30 July 2023,"Cats. The movie that I thought would be amazing, turned out as a semi-train wreck of a film. Good people like Judi Dench and Taylor Swift were dragged into this mess. The visual effects were terrible and it just wasn't good. It was a little concerning. Maybe not concerning, unsettling. I didn't really want/expect to see James Corden eating a chicken leg out of a trash can or Rebel Wilson dancing to a song dressed as a cat. I could name a lot of things better than this movie. I think I even spotted an occasional human hand mistake in there as well. The only good part about this movie was Jenifer Hudson. While I didn't really like her character, that song she had was surprisingly amazing. Maybe she knew the movie would be bad so she wanted to bring something to it. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but you could watch it for a lot of laughs."
2.0,8 January 2020,"I can't exactly say it was an awful movie,it had some beautiful elements,mostly in the ballet moments,but some choices like the music effects,certain movements or just setting were nothing but unsettling. I think it needs to erase more of that intentional or unintentional horror because it felt more like a fever dream than a proper movie.The choice of cgi for the designs is also really dumb. Overall,an okay movie but I wouldn't see it again.I'm never looking at my cat the same ever again."
3.0,11 September 2022,"I rarely leave reviews, and I was willing to give this a chance (on Amazon Prime), as I wanted to form my own opinion. However there is no saving this: the main problem I have is that there is no story set up, at all. They just start singing and dancing almost immediately and it's downhill from there. No background, backstory or set up. This isn't even factoring in the questionable CGI, cheap-looking sets and forgettable songs. Even big name stars aren't enough to pull this out of its funk. Pity - it had potential to be more than this cat-tastrophe, but it just seems to unwind like a big ball of twine. Needless to say, it's put me off ever seeing the stage play as well."

3.0,21 December 2019,"I have not seen the play, so my expectations were on the ground. This is not an awful film. Its pretty amazing how it turned out thanks to our film technology. I will say, the CGI on their footwork was not the best. You could tell that was edited. But overrall Cata was not a bad movie, nor was the plot confusing. The plot is determing who will be the nect gellical cat. Of course theres a villain and you know that from the beggining. People are saying its slow, but it feels like a theatrical musical. Every scene is a song and at some point youre going to just want them to have dialouge instead of lyrics. Some songs are catchier than others and more fun. Cats is art."
1.0,15 July 2023,"I grew up loving the original Cats movie. This version is the worst piece of trash I've ever seen. They completely ruined a masterpiece by Andrew Lloyd Webber and it's a disgrace. I'm glad I didn't waste money on it, it was just on tv. It's like a car crash it's painful to look at but also difficult to look away. I hope that people who haven't seen the older version won't be deterred from it after seeing this disaster because this is just an embarrassment. There were some details that filled in some of the story but it's mostly just cheesy. It seems like they tried to add some comedy but that really just made it more pathetic. Please go watch the movie that was released in 1998 instead of attempting to sit through this awful remake."

3.0,30 December 2019,"I've never seen Cats before so I was uncorrupted by past experience. Wasn't particularly looking forward to it in view of all the negative press but I'd already booked the tickets and guess what? I really enjoyed it. As a musical about singing cats it does a good job. It's lively and enjoyable which is what you want in a light hearted musical.

As for the cast Judi Dench does a fair job singing for an 85 year old, certainly better at singing than a certain co-star of hers a few years ago. Of course, you could be arguing whether an 85 year old has the voice for it. The other older cast members, Ian McKellen and Ray Winstone do well. I'm old so I have no idea who the other cast were but they do their jobs well. I would argue that Jennifer Hudson overcooks "" Memory"" but most singers in this day and age seem to think that emotion means volume. I blame Whitney Houston and Celine Dion.

If you're thinking about going ignore all the 1* reviews. It's not perfect but it's not the old dog that some say it is."
4.0,25 March 2023,"Cats has been a show I've loved since I was a child. I saw the Broadway production when I was little and loved the dancing, acrobatics, music, and pure energy of the show. I agree there isn't a strong plot to the show, and that's okay because it's just fun to watch and listen. This is not even close to an adequate representation of the show. Go see it live. I agree with what Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote in his review of this: ""(This is) off-the-scale all wrong. I saw it and I just thought, 'Oh, God, no. ' It was the first time in my 70-odd years on this planet that I went out and bought a dog."" Truer words haven't been spoken!"

Its bad all the way through but gets slightly better around the halfway mark, when they actually focus on the plot. Its just... so uncomfortable, unsettling, and unnatural that it's hard to do on anything except seeing the bad stuff. You're literally just watching naked people dance and sing. That, on top of the fact that I already hate musicals made the experience worse than it initially was.

I do, however, recommend it for the experience and ""bragging rights"". If you can suffer through this, everything else will be a piece of cake."

1.0,28 September 2020,"""Cats."" That single word summons more paralysing terror in those who watched this film than any horror movie released in the last 10 years. The initial trailer caused mass hysteria across the internet when it was unleased upon the world in 2019. Like the opening of Pandora's Box, once the images of those obscene CGI cat-human hybrids had escaped into the world, they could not be put back into the darkness from which they came. Despite the memes and jeers pouring in from every direction, some people were optimistic, believing that this movie could be good... it wasn't. ""Cats"" is nothing more or less than the spawn of Satan himself. In fact, that's a little bit cruel, if Satan had spawned this monstrosity, he would have disowned it and sent it packing immediately. Never have I witnessed a movie this expensive, with this calibre of on-screen talent at its disposal, failing on so many conceivable levels. The songs range from average to agonising, the cast are either miscast or have their dignity stripped away from them (or both) and the visuals are the stuff of the most fevered of night terrors. However, I loved watching it! Yes it's an appalling travesty, yes it makes no sense, but I'm so happy that ""Cats"" exists. From the ludicrous opening scene to the final musical number, in which DAME Judi Dench addresses the audience directly to remind us that ""a cat is NOT a dog"", I was rolling on the floor, howling with laughter. It's surreal to see a 95 million dollar film take this much of a swing and miss so spectacularly, but I had a blast watching this movie fall flat on its horrifying face. So although it's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I enjoyed ""Cats"" immensely, but for all the wrong reasons. So let's go to the Jellicle Ball and try to make sense of the disaster-piece that is Tom Hooper's ""Cats."" As I mentioned previously, the cast in this nightmare are generally talented, but all of them are dreadful here. It's definitely not the actors fault, as even Arnold Schwarzenegger, the God of one-liners, couldn't have made putrid dialogue like ""I believe you truly are a Jellicle cat, a dellicle cat"" sound good. Whilst all of the performances are terrible, they're all awful for different reasons. James Cordon and Rebel Wilson feel severely out-of-place as the, er, comic relief? I'm aware that a great many people find these two actors irritating (Cordon in particular), but I personally don't have anything against them. However, they are incredibly annoying here, they feel like they're in a completely different movie to everyone else, performing their usual shticks of making fat jokes and falling over. This is probably as good a point as any to mention how appalling the comedy in ""Cats"" is (the script is littered with atrocious cat puns that make Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" look like a Christopher Nolan movie.) That isn't to say that ""Cats"" is devoid of comedic value, as listening to Ray Winstone singing or watching SIR Ian McKellen lick milk out of a bowl made me laugh more than most modern comedies do, but I think it's fair to say that these moments weren't supposed to make us snigger. I feel really sorry for Francesca Hayward, Naoimh Morgan and the other young actors who have never been in a movie before and presumably thought that ""Cats"" was going to be their ticket to stardom. I sincerely hope that they'll get another chance to prove themselves as actors, and that the rest of their careers won't be ruined because of this mess. I'll admit, Idris Elba and Jennifer Hudson were almost good in ""Cats"", Elba is clearly relishing the opportunity to chew up the scenery and Hudson attempts to give an emotionally rich performance. Sadly, both actors are undercut by the woeful CGI that the entire film is caked in, which creates many deeply disturbing moments throughout the run time. Elba's character removes his fur coat about two-thirds into the movie, revealing his dark brown fur underneath. What makes this so unsettling is that A. his fur coat looks like it's been made from the pelts of skinned cat corpses and B. he looks stark raving naked as he prances around and flirts with Taylor Swift (whose barely in the film.) Do I need to explain why a nude-looking mutant Idris Elba feline fiend is distressing to watch? Jennifer Hudson also sports a fur coat (I have so many questions) but thankfully she never takes it off. The problem with her character is that throughout the entirety of ""Cats"", a tendril of snot is careening down her character's face. I understand that this is supposed to signify how sickly and depressed she is, but for crying out loud, I couldn't take my eyes of that train of ooze whenever Hudson was on screen. It was really distracting! Imagine being the CG artist who crafted that strand of mucus, you work long hours, miss your kid's karate ceremonies and become increasingly distant with your spouse. But it's all worth it, because you constructed a photorealistic trail of snot for the 2019 film ""Cats""... Before I move onto the other elements of ""Cats"" that make it an atrocity against all of humanity, I'd like to voice my anger that Tom Hooper took SIR Ian McKellen and DAME Judi Dench, two of the greatest actors of their generation and absolute national treasures, and destroyed every ounce of nobility they possessed. These are two actors that are respected across the globe, they've starred in some of my all-time favourite movies and have both been nominated for Academy Awards (with Dench winning for ""Shakespeare in Love."" She should have won again for ""Skyfall."") Yet in ""Cats"", they are transformed into computer generated monstrosity's that will haunt my dreams until the day I die, spouting horrifically bad dialogue and doing things we never wanted to see these legendary thespians doing. I laughed, but inside, I was crying! Even though the characters have the charisma of a pile of polystyrene ducks and the visuals should be number one on the Schmidt pain index, if the narrative in ""Cats"" was compelling, the film might have been saved. Sadly, there is no plot in ""Cats"", I still don't understand what a Jellicle is, the main goal of every character is to DIE and the pacing is about as fast as a mouse on its way to a cat convention. The story unfolds like this: a cat appears to sing their own praises, then another cat appears and does the exact same thing. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat! ""Cats"" is based on a supposedly popular musical, so at the very least, the music in the film should be good right? WRONG! The songs are aggravatingly overlong rambles that fail to make us care about anything that's happening in the film, they don't have any logic behind them and they aren't engaging to listen to. I will admit, I tapped my feet twice whilst watching ""Cats"", but that may have been because I was being sucked into a maelstrom of madness and mania, rather than because I actually liked the songs. But without a doubt, the biggest flaw of this hate crime of a film is the visual design. ""Cats"" is a truly petrifying watch, the CG cats that scuttled out of the darkest pits of hell are some of the most blood-curdling beasts I've ever witnessed! The cats with human faces, feet and hands (plus a wedding ring in Judi Dench's case) shatter the Uncanny Valley into pieces. Our brains cannot comprehend what we're seeing, we know that the characters aren't human, but we can still distinguish their human features, causing our minds to go completely haywire. This isn't helped by the fact that the scale of the characters is constantly shifting from scene to scene, which adds to the hallucinatory atmosphere. This hair-raising horror is at its most unnerving when Rebel Wilson's cat unzips her own fur to reveal a dress and more fur underneath, eats a cockroach plastered with a person's face upon it and terrorises a group of mice with children's faces... WHAT?! WHY?! HOW?! I feel bad for any young children whose first trip to the cinema was to see ""Cats."" If I'd seen this movie as a kid, it would have scarred me for the rest of my life and made me never want to see a film ever again! In conclusion, ""Cats"" is as traumatic, baffling and disgraceful as everyone says it is. It's possible that this will go the way of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" or ""The Room"" and become a cult classic, but as of now, ""Cats"" deserves all the criticism it receives. It's a complete CATastrophe. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist."

1.0,5 January 2020,This is one of two movies that I've walked out of in theaters in my lifetime. It was so bad I literally couldn't stand to sit there anymore.
1.0,18 October 2020,"Last year, one of the most talked about movies was a feature-length film adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Cats. Directed by Tom Hooper off his smash hit Les Miserables, the film looked like oscar-bait magic in the making, but as soon as the first trailers came out, audiences were quick to judge how horrifying it looked. Unsurprisingly, the movie was not only a box office flop, but the critics trashed it to the point of hailing it as one of the worst films ever made. After almost a year since it's release and having seen it myself, I only have one question to ask. What in the world were they thinking?

Right off the bat, the most glaring flaw with Cats are the CGI-felines themselves, as they come off so uncanny that they hurt the eyes. Unlike the original Broadway musical where it was actors in detailed cat costumes, this movie decided to go for a motion-captured realistic look of humans that look like cats, and the result is pure nightmare fuel. The designs are bad enough to look at on their own, but watching them move around just adds in to the uncomfortableness. Also, according to research, the animation crew behind the feature had less than a year to animate the entire movie, and one can tell since some of the compositing feels so fake and unbelievable. In addition, while the art direction and production design looks bright and shiny to some capacity, what keeps it from being special is how inconsistent the environments are in terms of scale, from bizarre objects to the height of buildings compared to the tiny cats. This is supposed to focus on cats, but when their sizes are all over the place, that's when you know this movie should have been fully animated.

However, another major problem centering around the whole movie is its source material, because whether you love the original musical or not, we can all agree that the one thing Cats has always lacked is a cohesive story. That may be fitting for a play that's all about dancing and showmanship, but when you translate that into a feature film, you need more substance than just style and pizzazz. It doesn't help that most of the songs in the movie are basically introduction songs to random cat characters, from the obese Bustopher Jones, to the villanous Macavity, to the prima dona Jennyanydots, to the mischevious Bombolurina, to the magical Mr. Mistoffelees, to the admired matriarch Old Deuteronomy. There's a difference between exposition to set up the story and the entire story being exposition, and the vast majority of them don't even affect the already paper thin plot. It's really sad when I can barely even remember the main character she was so bland, and that's a sign of bad connection when you've failed to attract audiences to your focal felines.

Now if there's anything remotely positive to give to the movie, at least the music is well conducted and the singing feels very reminiscent of the original Broadway musical. With an all-star cast of singers/actors like James Corden, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Idris Elba, Judi Dench, Rebel Wilson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift and more, they really gave it their all through their singing performances and even dance moves. I'll even go as far as to say that Hudson's cover of the musical's most popular song Memory might be one of the best takes on the iconic classic. If you don't want to watch the movie, it wouldn't hurt to listen to the soundtrack on its own, even if you'll get the same amount of substance as the source material. And that right there highlights the biggest problem with the movie, how little of a point it has to exist instead of just staying on Broadway. Maybe once upon a time the musical had a chance on the big screen, but given how little there was to work with from the start, it's not surprising that the only thing to take away from this trainwreck are the songs and that's it.

Not only is Cats an eye soar to look at with its ugly character designs and jumbled production scope, but it might be one of the most pointless excuses of a movie I've ever seen. When your source lacks a story, appealing characters and important songs to begin with, you're pretty much screwed to begin with. It goes to show you that no matter how popular a Broadway musical is, that doesn't make it worth translating into another medium like cinema. Outside of ironic enjoyment and possible die hard Cats fan screenings, this movie is better left off in the kitty litter dump."
1.0,24 December 2019,"For sheer entertainment factor this film was okay/poor, but nothing more than that. The music was catchy (some of the singing was good) and some of the dance numbers were great though this was overshadowed by the absolute lack of clear story. Towards the end of the film you can make your own assumptions about what the film is trying to teach, for me it tried to show that everyone deserves a second chance though its too open to interpretation. Quite simply if it was on television or available on Netflix, prime etc I would change the channel or simply just not watch it. It has too many fundamental flaws to be considered a worthwhile watch.

5.0,1 January 2020,"Without using the feline metaphors (which are more than apt in this circumstances) I'll give it to you down the barrell, Cats is not great film at all. Andrew Lloyd Webber has been blessed with reasonable adaptations of his work (Les Miserable & Evita), but even he can see how wrong this is on most levels.

Victoria (1st timer Felicity Hayward) is abandoned and meets the world of Jellicle cats whom stay in their own world singing songs waiting and wishing that Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) is impressed and makes one of them the entitled to rise to Heaviside (cat heaven). Confused?? Well it gets worse, there are cameos by Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift that are excruciating. Then for James Corben just plain embarrassing.

So why 3/10 we'll if it wasn't for Macavity (Idris Elba) and the tones of Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), with Memories the only highlight in a really disappointing film, it would be a lot worse."

1.0,29 December 2019,"I went to watch this film with my 11 year old daughter who really enjoyed it and gave it 8 out of 10 stars. I had read all of the bad reviews so was expecting a terrible experience, however to my surprise I actually quite enjoyed it. Idris Elbas performance was brilliant, as was Taylor Swifts. I have never seen the actual musical at the theatre but never the less I still enjoyed this film. Anyone who gives this film a rating of less than 3 stars needs to be neutered immediately to prevent them from having any further complaints.

Definitely worth watching.

1.0,6 January 2020,"It baffles me how this movie exists in the state that it does as surely, everyone involved must've known how terrible it was. The first problem is the CGI which is straight up uncanny valley and made a child cry at my screening as soon as the cats first appeared. The better options would've been either costumes or full on animation and the decision to do the CGI is plain lazy and baffling. When Tom Hooper saw the CGI he should've rushed back into the cutting room and thrown all of the footage in the trash. He then should've rushed to the nearest Hot Topic as even the cheapest cat costumes would've looked better than what we got. Furthermore, the lack of plot might've worked in a play but it doesn't in a movie. The whole story is just a bad song after another which introduces a new cat that explains why they should be offered as a sacrifice by the leader of their cult to be reborn in some sort of new life. You don't care about any characters and the ""Memory"" moment which is meant to be emotional comes off as unintentionally hilarious, just like the rest of the movie. I went to see this as I just had to see for myself how bad it was and it was just as terrible as I hoped. I can't fault the movie for being boring as I enjoyed it all the way through despite the songs getting very tiring. There were many children at my screening and I found that very odd as I would not want to subject my child to this film if I was a parent. Seriously, this movie is extremely erotic and not for children. The cats constantly rub against each other, hump the floor and there are instances of them sniffing each others crotches and spreading their legs wide open. Taylor Swift who is in the movie very briefly wears high heels for the sole reason of accentuating her cat legs to make her looks sexy and she uses catnip on the cats which I seriously thought was going to send them all into a frenzy that would result in an orgy. There were many instances like that where I forgot I was watching a PG movie. If the movie doesn't turn children into furries down the line, it is sure to give them nightmares, especially when they see the CGI mice with human faces which will go down in history as one of the scariest creatures created in film. All in all, I can't give this movie anything less than a 5 because it entertained me too much and there were many times when I wanted to burst out laughing. That could be because this mess of a bizarre movie was making me insane but this piece of utter schlock must be seen to be believed and it will go down in history as one of the weirdest big budget productions of all time."
3.0,31 December 2019,"It's just very very bad. It's a poor movie adaptation of a musical.

Imagine a high school doing a play. They decide to put on Cats. They have some hipster young pseudo progressive music teacher who has never taught, choreographed or put a play together before decide to attempt to reimagine Cats. Then it was filmed. This is the end result.

I think they already made a comedy movie about this type of thing being done. It's called Hamlet 2. Watch that instead at least it's funny.

The CGI isn't as bad as some make it out to be. This isn't something like the upcoming Sonic movie though where it can simply be fixed with CGI being redone. That's not the problem here. The general outline of Cats has been changed. The choreography reminds me of the ""Indian Thriller"" Golimar song from the Bollywood movie Donga. It's kinda like Michael Jackson's Thriller except it isn't. Cats is kinda like a Cats except it isn't. It's a bad plodding reimagined version of Cats made by people who have no idea what they are doing. Where is the dancing? Why are cats changed? Why are certain thing arbitrarily added? Good question. I haven't an answer. There isn't any actual reason to change these things but they did.

I'm not sure why anyone would want to see this other than morbid curiosity which is why I saw it.

Take your money. Set it aside.

-If you want to see Cats wait for some local theater to put on a production of Cats, go see that instead. It will almost certainly be better.

-If you want to watch a musical made into a movie go watch Evita that's a better example of how it should be done.

-If you want the comedy aspect of how I think this movie came about watch Hamlet 2.

Do not see this."

1.0,30 December 2019,"Look, I want to be fair, so I won't give the film a 1 out of 10, solely because of technical achievement and that it is a replica of the Broadway show.

But it is nothing more than a CGI version of the Broadway show. Same music, songs, etc. So if you LOVE the Broadway show, you will enjoy this film.

But I have seen the Broadway show, and really didn't care to see the EXACT same show again. If anything, they should have done one of those broadcasts of a live performance of Cats, paid Taylor Swift to participate, and called it a day.

Three minutes in I knew I was in trouble and would be bored to tears, so I intentionally took a nap while my wife and mother suffered through the film.

2.0,24 December 2019,"I went to see Cats with very low expectations but came out wondering what on earth all the fuss was about. Too many reviewers have leapt on the ""If the critics say it's bad,it must be bad"" bandwagon - people do like an excuse to give something a good slammming. It may not have the wow factor that The Greatest Showman had, but Cats is an enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours - just don't think about it too hard! You've got people dressed up as cats, for goodness sake, if you think about it intellectually of course it's going to be weird. But if you think about Star Wars intellectually and critically, you've got sound in space which is physically impossible and light beams emerging from a battery and stopping after 3 feet; if you think about Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you've got people defying the laws of physics because they're super good at martial arts. Cats is a cinematic musical fantasy and that's the mindset with which you need to watch it. What's missing is an engaging storyline to pull you in and carry you along - but that is really the fault of the original stage show. And, to be fair, there are a couple of terrible casting choices - Idris Elba is uncomfortably out of place and obviously can't sing. But the songs and dances, performed essentially as set pieces, have been superbly choreographed and cleverly produced. Visually, it is rich and fantastical with sets that have the feel of the best contemporary stage sets. I am not ashamed to say that I'd go to see it again and I'll probably get the DVD."
10.0,7 January 2020,"If you are reading this review, then you probably already know that ""Cats"" has been widely panned by critical and general audiences since before it was even released. After releasing, some of the cgi was considered so jarring that updates to the film were made and new versions screened after the first couple of weeks in the theaters. Unfortunately, there was no way to erase the movie, and money spent on it, from existence entirely which is what this film really needs.

I can't say this will be along review. I can only describe for so long the strange sights and sounds of ""Cats"" because without the context of seeing the film it is nigh impossible to relate the discomfort, cringe inducing, and baffling moments that barrage you from the moment the film begins.

We open with a cat being tossed into the street inside of a bag and being freed by a group of cats called Jellicle . If you don't know what that means, don't worry. It won't be important and, like many things in this movie, won't be explained or of interest to either the characters in the film or the audience watching it. These Jellicle all sing songs about themselves and how special they are with the hopes of being chosen at the Jellicle Ball to go on to their afterlife/reward/heaven.

Seriously, the whole movie is just these cats singing about how much they like to dance, eat mice, and do magic.

The ways that this film goes off are innumerable from CGI that is jarring, to added one-liners that will have even the punniest jokesters rolling their eyes, and on to unexplained and convenient magical powers but the way that it seems to miss most profoundly, to me, is the entire conception and direction if this mainstay Broadway work.

""Cats,"" the theatrical production, is not loved because of its plot. It is loved because of the unique concept, dancing, and singing. When you take away the actual building of large sets and people acting like they are cat sized with just make-up and leotards you end up diminishing the skill necessary to create such an illusion. The productions works as a stage musical because you can't use cgi, an actor has to be able to leap that way or sing/purr that way with no help from computers. It is impressive. When it is all done with computers, there is no skill to be amazed by. The actor aren't really singing these songs even as they perform difficult dances. The actors themselves aren't really very good singers and only a few numbers actually land well at all.

It seems like a person who had no particular love for the musical form or specifically ""Cats"" got tasked with making it (though I am sure this is not so) and they never really understood what made the play special at all. They thus turned out a film which is only special in its tremendous failure and misconception from the start."

It's been more than thirty years since I walked out on a movie and I considered walking out of this one. I thought my intelligence was being insulted. They just brought the play and put it on a big screen and added animatronics the tails and ears twisting or distracting and the story is just plain stupid. As I say save your money let somebody else rent it when it's on dollar sale.

Also, not entirely sure why James Corden and Rebel Wilson are employed as actors, truly dreadful, especially the former. Also, the American actors didn't help; dreadful. Why employ someone who can't even at best attempt a UK accent, her, that played Rumpleteaser, awful.

Apart from the above negative points, I thought the supporting cast were great, the orchestration was excellent. A couple of dance numbers missing and 1 or 2 new items, but they worked. Some really stand out performances.

I think this film may have been rushed out, I don't recall. It's mainly bad editing, CGI and casting.

I also think, the story is easier to follow here than the stage version, it made more sense. There isn't much of a story to be fair, but this works."

Robbie Fairchild was a great Munkastrap, leading no only Victoria but us as well through the lives, of the Jellicles, and what a mixed bunch they are, naughty Mungojerry and Rumpleteezer, pompous Bustopher Jones, sweet Mistofeles and the amazing flying feet of Skimbleshanks, not to mention Gus and Old Deutaronomy.

In theater this will work because you'll have the gorgeous ballet which will stun you, so you wont miss that there is actually no story.

2.0,26 December 2019,"I saw this movie, knowing perfectly well that it would almost certainly be terrible and that the reviews were awful. I never liked the stage musical because spectacle is not important to me if the plot, lyrics and characters are shallow. I watched this because I like musicals, and it has some good music in it.

I wanted to be neutral going in, and I kind of was - until Rebel Wilson did her thing and just made me cringe... then Corden, who I like, made me cringe, maybe even more (and RW was a tough cringe-act to follow!) I truly think that acting-wise, there wasn't really a non-cringeworthy thing about this movie. But let's be honest, people who like the musical - it's ALWAYS been that way. It's always been complete nonsense, a silly induced 80s nightmare. I still to this day don't know why the musical was so popular. So, we can't blame all the cringe on Hooper.

A few redeeming factors in this. The choreography was pretty good at parts, even if not quite on par with the stage show. I was impressed with Steven McRae's tap-dancing. As a professional musician, I'm inclined to say the singing was maybe a B- at some parts, and middling to mediocre in others. But I liked Francesca Hayward and Robert Fairchild. So... dancing, 7/10, music, 5/10, acting, 2/10.

It's bad, but let's be real. It's never been a goldmine of a show."
5.0,23 December 2019,"I was hoping for so much from the trailer as it appeared the music had been updated from the very obvious classic sound that goes with so many of Lloyd Webber's musicals (Starlight Express) but it hasn't. I came away from the film thinking the same that I did when I saw the musical in the west end for the second time when Nicole PCDs was in it. My thoughts are that the story of Cats is just not that good it was very dry, boring at the start and didn't really get going until they start to audition for the new life. Memory always makes this story because it's a good song and people know that song and a couple others that are good. What I liked about it was Ian Mckellen, having seen his one man show it makes totals sense that he is Gus the Theatre cat he fit the part and it was like him playing his life in that part. The colours of the background were good, the songs were good for Skimbleshanks the Railway cat and the story that went with it. The storytelling in the film was a lot better I actually understood the plot of the story this time round. I did like Idris Elba as Macavity he brought real seedy and thuggishness to the part, i always knew this cat was bad but it comes to life a bit more in this and you get his story more. What I didn't like was some parts were definitely unnecessary, I think they are in the stage show but James Corden and Rebel Wilson were wasted and did not make those parts any better, Jason Derulo, Ray Winstone and Taylor Swift weren't needed either. Also sometimes the songs took a while to get to the real good notes, they didn't seem to take off as well as they do onstage, for example Magical Mr Mistofeles is such a good song really fun but the anxious portrayal almost prevented the song from being good. Memory did hit the note and Jennifer Hudson was a good choice but I was very concerned it was going to be good as it kept being interrupted by another character and your like just let her sing and hit the notes which she did but right up until that note your a bit frustrated - well I was but I love Elaine Page's version a lot. This had such promise as there is a great cast I do think the songs are good in Cats but the story of Cats for me isn't enjoyable and I don't think anything could make that good for me, it needs more excitement at the start for me. What is good is bringing a West End stage show to the screen, musicals are so expensive to see meaning lots of people miss out and I think it's important for people to have the opportunity to see this type of show."
1.0,30 December 2019,"For some inconceivable reason, this film is rated G in Australia, despite its creepy sexual energy throughout the entire runtime. There are several moments where the cgi-enhanced bodysuits become uncannily similar to nudity to the point where it makes you literally cringe. One scene features Rebel Wilson splaying her legs open 90 degrees while scratching her inner thigh. I thought to myself as I was watching that any parents watching with their kids must be having some sort of panic attack, wondering if they walked into the parody instead of the G rated musical.

The story of Cats is fairly straightforward, we follow a gang of cats called the Jellicles as they go through a ceremony to select the next cat to be sent to the 'Heavyside Layer' (sort of like Heaven or Nirvana or something) and be reborn. We are shown this ceremony through the perspective of Victoria, a white cat who is abandoned by her owners at the beginning of the film before being taken in by the Jellicles.

However, just because the plot is straightforward, doesn't mean that its easy to follow. Imagine a path through a wood that is straight, but is covered in brambles and thorns, making navigation still incredibly difficult. That's what watching Cats was like. Many parts of the songs, especially the first song ""Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats"" while sounding good, are almost entirely incomprehensible. I only caught like 50% of what they were saying, as a lot of the voices blurred together or were overwhelmed by the orchestration.

The reason I'm rating it 2/10 instead of 1/10 is that I did like some of the songs. Maybe 3 songs were nice to listen to, including the famous song 'Memory'. It is obvious that with the cast and talent behind the camera that this was something the creators were passionate about, but it needs be remarked that the talent was sorely misplaced. Cats, from what I understand, is not a musical that transitions well from stage to screen. You might be able to make something decent by trimming the fat and making it an animated film that is like 80 minutes long or something, but Tom Hooper tried to give Cats the Les Miserables treatment, by stuffing the cast with High Calibre Actors (many of whom cant sing very well) and giving it an epic scale that also pays homage to the stage production (literally the only reason the art design went this way). But Cats isn't Les Mis. It needed more treatment and a better creative vision that I believe Tom Hooper wasn't prepared to provide. That, and Tom Hooper, director of Les Mis, the King's Speech and The Danish Girl, wasn't the guy to make a high-budget animated film. I don't think he knew anything about what he was doing, and with the apparent issues with the digital effects leading up to release (and afterwards) it definitely shows.

I would be very interested in hearing about the behind the scenes woes that this movie went through, as they would almost certainly be more entertaining than the finished product."
8.0,21 December 2019,"I can see how those who don't like musicals much and especially ALW ones would rip this to shreds. I'm NOT one of those. I thought that the movie was pretty good.....if for no other reason to see wonderful people do CAT things and sing those wonderful songs. I enjoyed every minute if this movie. It's beautifully drawn musically, choreographied, and scenically. The plot was tweaked and made better (yes, it's thin but it works for this play/movie). I thought Frances was impressive as hell and only overshadowed by Dame Judith Dench. And Jennifer Hudson....WOW! Her interpretation of 'Memory' brought me to tears (unexpected). Rebel Wilson and James Corden obviously had fun and, while I'm not a big fan, Taylor Swift was good! Idrid Elba was perfectly cast as was Ian McClellan. Songs were re-arranged, items added (mice, cockroaches..eeww), and, what to me was a nod to 'Phantom', a rising chandelier....a few things that made the movie quite interesting to watch unfold..."
6.0,2 January 2020,"If you are fan of the Musical you might actually enjoy this more than the other reviews might lead you to imagine.

Remember the reason this has little or no plot is that the estate of TS Eliot insisted that the musical (and therefore the movie) stick to the original Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, published in 1939.

So, given that massive limitation, this does a reasonable job of creating a movie version of what is essentially a musical poem.

The set is clearly designed to give a theatrical stage feel, as is the choreography and scenery chewing dramatics.

Yes, of course the CGI is weird. It is there to justify the fact that this is a movie, because real costumes would have simply replicated the stage play.

In summary, given that this exists - it probably shouldn't - then it is what I expected. The songs are not all clearly audible (yes I watched this in a cinema with all the mod cons), there are some very strange dubbing moments too."

1.0,26 December 2019,"It's been so long since there's been a theatrical, big budget disaster of this magnitude, but Cats manages to disappoint, disturb, and confuse at every single turn. As best I can tell, Cats revolves around a young kitten abandoned on the street who meets a variety of other cats before some big ball where one cat is named as the ultimate jellicle cat. This is really all there is to the film and it mostly consists of people you sort of know showing up, mugging for the camera, doing a song and dance, and then never being heard from again. There's also Idris Elba as an evil cat who wants to kill (or just magically transport them to another location?) all the runners up for the big award. Why? No one knows. Are some cats just born bad? Was he abused one too many times? Cats doesn't offer any answers of nuance and almost feels like you're watching a 3 hour movie that's had all the important character development and plot points scissored out, leaving us with a movie that doesn't make a lick of sense.

Pretty much every actor makes a fool of themselves multiple times throughout and you wonder what made them sign on to this mess in the first place. I will give director Tom Hooper one thing - it looks better and less claustrophobic than his Les Miserables with wider shots and a bevvy of colors swirling around the characters in an attempt to mimic the inner city night life. Sadly, visuals aren't enough to keep one's interest in a story that makes no sense and featuring characters who are this one dimensional and flat.

I'm afraid it's not even fun on a campy ""what were they thinking?"" kind of level like The Room or Showgirls."
4.0,26 December 2019,"Good thing I've watched the reviews and know what to expect. So it really helps with much foreseeable disappointments. So I managed to get quite a good experience with this, especially coming to towards the end.

Bad: the skintight were really unnecessary for most of the cats. Many should be better off with longer furs to cover the proper parts. The CG is also overly used with even some parts seen flickering. The facial placement on such character is REALLY weird, even when I'm warned early, The mouse is really the worst.

Good: The better performance comes towards the later parts of the story with better performers. The last even bring me some tears. The story itself finally comes to life when concluding towards the end. Learning about how there can be ""people"" of different characters, represented here as cats."
1.0,18 April 2020,How did any of the cast members actually sit there and think to themselves that it would be a good idea to star in this.
2.0,23 December 2019,"I was excited to see this film given the cast, seeing the stage show and how much I like Tom Hoopers work

It started off ok but I quickly became bored, then found another scene would then catch my interest again, found this was the theme throughout the film. I liked James cordon and rebel Wilson as they added some entertainment and light hearted ness to the film.

Jennifer Hudson's version of memories is amazing and gave me actual goosebumps, Francesca who played Victoria was amazing as well, just a shame her performance will be over looked due to how bad the film is been received.

I have given 5 stars due to the performance of the actors and the choreography, and I am a Tom hooper fan"
1.0,28 June 2020,"This was one hell of a movie to get through. Even getting drunk and watching it with friends was tough.

It falls into the categories of broadway shows that should have stayed where it was created. This version of it felt like a horror movie. Intensely creepy, sometimes horrifying, sometimes intolerable, and all out weird.

The CGI on the faces is particularly atrocious, as everyone agrees. And the close ups don't help at all. While clearly the terrifying cat people don't exist in real life, intense cult like environments, as depicted in this film, do. Being hopped up on drugs, forced to participate in strange rituals and competing in competitions in order to be ascend to a higher plain and come back to a better life (AKA be murdered) is something many cultists have performed over the years.

This was definitely an experience rather than your casual watch. So very, very, VERY bad indeed."

7.0,25 January 2020,Wasn't expecting much after all the awful reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. I love the music and it's based on a stage show so that's what I expected.. there's no major storyline.. other than each cats story. Yes the cgi is weird and even bad at times but it's also very clever how they do it at all. My husband gave up after ten minutes but me and my daughter enjoyed it.

It's difficult to describe the emotions I'm feeling now. It's a mix of pity for the actors involved and shock that something could be so very cringeworthy. This should never have happened. This movie should not have been made. Translating theatre to screen is a fine art that rarely succeeds but this, this monstrosity must be put to sleep. Euthanasia is the only way."

The play is a interminably ponderous, oh so precious, pretentious piece of dross that somehow was elevated to high art making it unfilm able. The only crime that the filmmakers made was agreeing to put this horror to film. They did their best, but virtually NO ONE could succeed in doing so."
5.0,26 December 2019,"Alright, it's like... This isn't a movie. But to be fair it was never suppose to be and putting aside everyone's dislike for the character designs (and not the visual effects, they're fine.), some things just aren't made to cross over all mediums. Apparently a semi plot was created to have a driving focus, which comes in the form of the entirely watchable Francesca Hayward's character. But in movie terms, it's 90% act I, 10% act III. It has maybe two decent musical numbers and whole lot of bland ones (and you know a movie's going wrong when Taylor Swift's solo is one of the good ones). The actors stay relatively committed to the farce and the cinematography and choreography is genuinely good, but I think it comes down to the director, at large. For the most part, it appears Tom Hooper is he's trying. Certain moments have a sheen to them, a certain level of craft. But other's look like they were made by an entirely different person. And even if he did put his heart and soul into this, to try and make it as good as humanly possible (and not for a truck load of money, which would be my guess), this again, sadly is not a movie, was never written as a movie and therefore has no place being called a movie."
10.0,20 November 2020,"Having seen ""Cats"" on Broadway and on tour several times, this live / CGI adaptation is pretty close to the stage play,of course taking liberties given the medium. Well cast, good, subtle gags and an okay interpretation. I would give it a 10, but... the source material is just dated. Personally I would have expected it to come to the screen in this mixed format, and it is done about as good as it can be done.

I think people were panning it just to pan it. I really think it's worth another view."
7.0,18 May 2020,"I don't really know why this film is getting such a bad rep. Once you get past the first song (WARNING: they do say Jellicle Cats quite a bit), it's an enjoyable film. Sure, you don't always know what's happening, bit it's an engaging film. I don't think the animation is too scary, although I wouldn't recommend taking young kids to it. It's actually quite mesmerizing once you get into it, and I think the animation is quite pretty. I understand it isn't for everybody, but I went with four people and three of them loved it. I would say it's worth a watch, especially as I think it's free on Amazon Prime. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone who doesn't like musicals though."

The movie lost 2 stars for being bad but gained 8 for being so much fun! So strange... just great."

1.0,5 February 2020,"I really see this being made for the lovers of the musical, not as a stand alone film. My bet is that the majority of people who rated it 1 star, have never seen the stage show.

You can see what Tom Hooper was trying to do, it just didn't come together very well. Don't expect a story, a plot or it to make any much sense. But if you enjoy dancing, costumes and the soundtrack, then you will get some enjoyment from it. The actors did well with that they had. The CGI is sketchy and artsy, but not without its flaws.

Even as a fan of theatre I had to skip through some bits because it dragged on. Plus I am not a huge fan of the show itself, even originally, although I do see its attraction.

The biggest issue for me is this re-imaging is that there was no emotional connection to it or any of the characters. People call it boring in the other reviews, but why is it boring? Its because it is very difficult to relate to any of the characters, they don't seem sympathetic. There is no emotional investment But that is a part of the stage play as well.

It just needs to viewed as a performance and not a story, and that's where I believe the majority of negative reviews are coming from."
5.0,18 April 2020,"First review I have left. I knew it was bad, but I am just stunned."
10.0,27 December 2019,"My Review Cats - my Rating 8/10

As anyone knows who reads my page I like musicals and have acquired some knowledge of this genre over the years . There have been some woeful Screen adaptations of famous Stage musicals eg A Chorus Line (1985) Man of La Mancha 1972 ,Camelot 1967, A Little Night Music 1977 to name a few. The 2019 Tom Hooper "" Cats""does not deserve the vendetta of bad press by so called Professional Critics who I think don't understand the genre of the film musical at all. I'm taking time over my Review as I want people to see this film ,it will polarise some people . I went with my regular film partner and he didn't care for it.

I on the other hand enjoyed it very much I had read a little of the bollocking this movie is receiving and also a review yesterday from a friend who also knows the musical stage and film genre so I was so pleasantly surprised to be in the minority camp of people who praise this innovative reworking of a stage musical . Cats has already been filmed in 1998 with the original Griizabella Elaine Paige .If you want to see cats filmed in a studio pretty much as it was on stage the 1998 version may appeal more to your tastes .

If you expect to hear the best vocal version of the hit song from Cats ,Memory sung by Jennifer Hudson you won't hear it in this version but her performance as the tired bedraggled and world weary Grizabella is the best acting performance I've seen of anyone in this pivotal role I can understand why her version is so full of pain.

I notice IMBD give the 1998 version a 7.6 Rating and this new version a measly 2.6 ? it's terribly unfair and doesn't give credit to the acting and technical expertise that has gone in to this production. The 1998 version while authentic to the stage production doesn't expand the horizon of the wonderful world of Cats or add anything new the 2019 version does.

Critics can unfortunately ruin a films prospects at the box office I hate the phrase some friends use "" oh I didn't go and see it because it got rotten reviews "" I always say make up your own mind I've seen so many enjoyable movies that the critics have panned and I've seen some very average films that some critics wax lyrically about.

This new version of Cats directed by Tom Hooper ( The Kings Speech, The Danish Girl, Les Miserables) who also was a screenwriter with Lee Hall on this project features some great talent and magical moments . It's a very different setting to the stage production which was basically a big rubbish tip. It pays homage to other screen musicals ,especially Busby Berkeley and Mrs Henderson Presents. Dame Judi Dench was Mrs Henderson and that film was set in The Windmill theatre which also features in this as a set for Cats. The rest of the scenes are in London itself in various locations like Trafalgar Square The Thames and a fabulous production number performed by Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat on a rail bridge to a great London station.

Francesca Hayward a Royal Ballet principle is wonderfully cast as Victoria the elegant timid White Cat who is dumped in the alley where the tribe of Jellicle cats are competing and waiting to be chosen to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new Jellicle life.

The plot is basically just that and it's based on a collection of poems by T.S. Elliott . Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs introduce all the characters like Bombalurina, Macavity, Mr Mistoffelees , the magician played so well by Laurie Davidson. James Corden as Bustopher Jones the fat cat in spats is fun Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots is Rebel Wilson. Idris Elba as Macavity the villain of the piece is also very good in the role.

Terrific choreography very different in parts to the stage production in fact it's the younger less known actors that are the Stars of this film apart from Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Dame Judi I think is wonderful as Old Deuteronomy in fact her final scene in Trafalgar Square moved me to a few tears. Ian McKellen is also wonderful as Gus The Theatre Cat and both these veterans of British theatre add great pathos and class I imagine the rest of the young cast must have felt privileged to be in this film. I especially enjoyed

If I go to see a film adaptation of a musical I want it to be more intimate than the stage version and to transport me and inspire my imagination. I didn't like Tom Hoopers last musical film Les Miserables mainly for live singing if you can call Russell Crowe's voice singing but also because to me it lacked intimacy ,but I must say he has won me over in his latest musical Cats.

Please Ignore the negative critical onslaught on this film adaptation of Cats ,make up your own mind . The estimated cost budget of this musical is USD 95,000,000 you can see every dollar spent in the sets and production numbers .The film is doing very poorly due to bad press and deserves a much better reception I hope for the sake of future musical films it does succeed."

There is no real plot to speak of and the songs are lackluster. The known actors are horrible in this and the unknown ones are just as bad.

How did they not know this was gonna be a bomb? Further the director, who hasnt worked since, should not be allowed to make another movie"
2.0,9 June 2020,"Let me make something clear. My friend and I only went to see this movie purely for the reason of making fun of it. We didn't expect it to be good, but we didn't expect it to be as unbearable as it really is. We walked into the theater to find only two other people in there with us. On a Saturday night. They left after 20 minutes. We tried our best but wound up leaving after about 40 minutes because we felt physically ill watching it. I can't even begin to describe the way this movie made me feel other than sick. The entire thing felt like a horrible fever dream and we just had to get out. I'd rather stare at a wall for 2 hours than watch this movie for even 5 minutes."

3.0,29 September 2021,"""Cats"" is a Comedy - Drama musical in which we watch a tribe of cats (Jellicles) that needs to decide and choose one of them to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and later to return back to a new life.

I did not like this musical because it seemed that was created a bit sloppy since it had many mistakes. A lot of famous actors and actresses play in this musical but the poor direction of Tom Hooper did not succeed on presenting them as they needed to be and they did not reach their potential. In addition to this, the beautiful music made by Andrew Lloyd Webber unfortunately, it could not save this musical. To sum up, I have to say that ""Cats"" is a poor musical and I do not recommend anyone to watch it because I believe that it's a waste of time."
10.0,18 February 2020,"Before I watched this one, I've read a lot of reviews saying that this film's really bad. I didn't believe it, so, I chose to watch it to know whether it's bad like they said.

After I watched the beginning part, I was like what did I just watch? The film is so awful. Not to mention humans in Cat version is so creepy and sort of disgusting, all those singing in no rhythm is so annoying. Maybe I'm not that much into original score or whatever, I could endure the songs used in Frozen 2, but I couldn't endure those songs of this film. Although, I've tried to keep watching to the end, I couldn't continue after 10 minutes. The film's so boring. I was nearly fell asleep. So, finally, I stopped watching it. Because of the fact that I didn't watch it to the end, I don't know how the story goes or what it is all about. The story might be good or whatever, but the presentation and all those cat persons made me stopped watching to the end.

As for conclusion, Cats film is really terrible and I wouldn't watch it if I were you. There are a lot of great or good films out there. Leave this one and go watch the others because this film is totally not worth to give a chance."

I can't quite understand the grumbles about CGI; I was transfixed by the wonderful footwork of the dancers, their feline balletic grace, and the banging soundtrack that kept the momentum going for a FUN 2 hours. The actors who portrayed the individual cats were great in their own ways, which prevents me from choosing a favorite, but I do have to say I enjoyed Sir Ian McKellan and Judi Dench's portrayals immensely. Overall I appreciated the creative effort required to bring this masterpiece to life. I hope others go into it with an open mind ready to form an opinion uninfluenced by those who declare it to be unworthy of acclaim. Thank you to all those involved in this film.

I won't list the reasons because ten thousands other reviewers already have. There are so many films and series in the past two years that I've noted had so much potential but died in execution due in large part to their directors. Those in charge, the EPs - including hall of famers Andrew Lloyd Webber and Steven Spielberg both in their approaching senility 70s, should've stopped this in early production though I'm sure Tom Hooper convinced them it would look great after CG post-processing, and by then it's too late. You either have to cancel release or re-shoot at huge cost, costs which the film no matter how good wasn't going to re-coup since it'd never be a $billion earner."

8.0,4 October 2021,"Cats is AWFUL; it's hysterically (but SUPER ironically) funny from the get-go. The story's non-existent, the characters are shallow but worst of all they don't look like actual cats at all; they look like a science experiment gone horribly wrong. I was virtually in tears of laughter form the first five minutes alone; and that's not a compliment, because this film was supposed to be a character-centric comedy-drama instead of a furry's fever dream on Broadway/West End seemingly 'directed' by Tobe 'The King's Speech' Hooper. What happened!? I was laughing because of the bad graphics and muddled singing; THAT and the clueless direction that doesn't translate from stage musical to movie at all (if it were actually animated it might have had a fighting chance at being good).

Cats is definitely 2019's greatest horror-comedy for all the wrong reasons: its uncanny effects and film-crippling performances from James Corden and Rebel Wilson make this all feel like it was never real; but it was. Universal bankrolled this film AND a campaign to COMPETE AT THE OSCARS!? If this got nominated for Best Picture (which thankfully it didn't) it would have turned the WHOLE ceremony into an immortal joke.

Cats is 2019's ironic classic; it's bound to become a midnight movie favourite in the style of Birdemic rather than The Room (because The Room is actually entertaining with its unawareness and unintentional farce).

0/5 stars (honestly). It's GREAT for an ironic laugh, but it's gonna give you a splitting headache if you don't have alcohol on standby. You've been warned."

2.0,21 December 2019,"LIKES:

The Setting The Design Of Each Cat (though odd) Some Of The Song And Dance Numbers The Pace

DISLIKES:

Limited Story Some Song and Dance Numbers The Fake look sometimes Not utilizing the Cast Well Not Taking The Creative Liberties When They should have Just Limited Over All

The Verdict:

Cats is what you expect from the trailers, a big musical number that is all about dancing and soundtracks and little of anything else. The technology prowess reigns supreme in bringing the world and visuals to life, and many of the new twists to the songs give it a breath of fresh air to liven things up. Yet, this face paced dance flick just really does not deliver on many things outside of the lavish numbers. Rather than taking some liberties to expand the story and use of the characters, the movie sticks a little too close to the traditional roots, leaving it very simple and kind of dull in the grand scheme of things. If you are looking to experience the show for the first time, this could be a decent substitute, but for those in love of the plays or looking for a musical with more sustenance, heart, and coordination, well you should go in with lower expectations. As such, I'm mixed in terms of telling you if worth a theater visit, but for the stage show, effects, and visual numbers the theater will assist, but for everything else, watch this one at home instead. Due to the missed potential this movie could have done, I'll give this film a:

Comedy/Drama/Family: 5.0 Movie Overall: 4.0"
1.0,24 April 2022,I love musicals and I've always loved the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. The sets were gorgeous and the costumes were great. The dancing was fantastic.
1.0,25 December 2019,"I have seen the stage production ""cats' twice before seeing this movie. Once about 25 years ago and once as recent as earlier this year. In both cases, I did not like the show despite normally being fond of musicals. There appears to be no plot and the show seems to be just a series of mostly nonsensical songs about cats. I was so puzzled why it is such a popular musical - the fourth longest running on Braodway, sixth longest running on West End, an international success through it's traveling production, and winning 7 Tony awards including best musical - that I felt I was missing something. My research revealed that there is indeed not much of a plot, but that spectators love the catchy music, the impressive dancing and the remarkable costumes. I also found out that the musical is based on a poetry collection, ""Old Possum's book of Practical Cats"", by TS Eliot and is therefore less about the storyline as it is about the individual poems brought to live in the music.

It is with that backdrop that I went to see the movie, expecting not to like it. It did not help that I have been reading horrible reviews of the movie especially criticizing the lack of a plotline, the humanoid cats and the poor CGI.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. I did not expect much of a plot, but it was much better than in the show as I could better understand the singing, there was some additional dialogue and an additional subplot that added more context and more of a story line. I feel like I now finally understand the show. I actually liked the humanoid cats as I thought it brings out the best of both worlds: the dancing is really good and preserving the human body as much as possible helps to bring that out. On the other hand, adding the fur, the cat ears and the tails adds an extra dimension with a nice blend between the cats that are being portrayed and the human movements. I did also mostly like the CGI as it gave the director more creativity on how to use the environment.

Despite all the negative reviews, I actually really liked the movie and may go see it again. The music and singing is catchy, the dancing and choreography amazing, the acting excellent, especially from some of the less known actors such as Francesca Hayward and Laura Davidson, and the plotline much clearer than in the show. The movie made me appreciate the stage production more.

Some things that did bring the rating down for me include the weak plotline, which seems unavoidable considering the source material, and the sometimes poorly implemented CGI, especially if you pay closer attention to the details. There were so many problems with the CGI that the studio released a new version within the first week of the show having hit the theatre to fix a number of them, something I never heard of being done in the past.

The lyrics of one of the songs in the movie says it well: ""All that I wanted, was to be wanted"".

If anything, it needed more Corden though, not less. See if you can spot the uncredited cameos by Robert Downey Junior and Vin Diesel.

LOL, no I'm just kidding. This was unspeakably horrible."

6.0,5 June 2020,"I've seen a lot of bad movies, but I can say that Cats is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The point that draws attention right away without a doubt is the CGI, which is the worst I have seen in my life, the proportion of cats is wrong, it seems that those involved have never seen a cat in their lives, they are at least 3 times smaller than a normal cat, you can see that some actors tried, however, the script didn't help, and the CGI makes the scenes that were supposed to be dramatic funny, there's practically no character development, the villain doesn't intimidate. As much as it is directed by Tom Hooper, who is a good director, the direction of Cats is very bad, and the film has what is perhaps the worst break of the fourth wall in the history of cinema, I could not see anything positive in the film , even if I tried hard, I couldn't find a good thing in the film."
2.0,28 November 2020,"So even with all the bad reviews, nothing prepared me for how bad this actually is. I'm shocked the high caliber of actors was able to produce such garbage. Like they really would have had to work hard to make it this bad. Please take my advice. Do not doubt the reviews and just STAY AWAY!!"
1.0,23 February 2021,"As much improved as the Tom Hooper film adaptation of Cats is to the stage musical, there is one element that both have in common: the opening number is incredibly rousing and impressive, and the rest of the show falls short. ""Jellicle Cats"" is a toe-tapping number with great dancing, introducing the characters and the environment of the alley cats. It goes on and on, raising the audience's spirits and hopes - and then you hear the rest of the songs.

Cats is basically a feline-version of A Chorus Line, with each cat coming forward with his or her own song and vignette that isn't tied to any other's. There is an underlying story, just as in A Chorus Line: one cat will be chosen to be the Jellicle Cat and sail off in a hot air balloon. No, it's never explained why cats have access to a hot air balloon, nor is it explained what in the world a Jellicle Cat actually is. The songs are forgettable, irritating, and sound as if the performers were ad-libbing their notes. They do not sound like they were written by an accomplished composer who wrote ""Music of the Night"" and ""Beneath a Moonless Sky"". The lyrics, taken from T.S. Eliot's poems, are more confusing than clever. Cats don't break into houses and steal things; they're afraid of confrontation. They also don't try to lure other cats to the ""dark side"" with addictive catnip.

However, the special effects, costumes, makeup, and set designs are off-the-charts fantastic. A simple tap-dance number for the cat who hangs out at the train tracks gets transformed to an exciting traveling adventure. Cats tap on the rail, dance in the compartment, and sing into the beautiful London skyline. The tuxedo cat who performs magic tricks showers the chorus with rose petals and glitter. Tom Hooper did as much as was possible for him to do to improve the show. I don't know why he wanted to bring Cats to the big screen, though, since the songs are the main problem.

Everyone in the cast tried very hard, and it was very cute to see Judi Dench with her puffy, fluffy fur as Old Deuteronomy. Jennifer Hudson was naturally given the show-stopping song, but her performance was very disappointing. Whether it was because she was forced to sing live (remember Les Miserables?) and would have benefited from the relaxed environment of a sound studio, or whether she's just lost her powerful voice from thirteen years ago, or whether she was just too emotionally involved in acting in front of the camera and couldn't sing at the same time (it is actually impossible to cry and sing at the same time), we'll never know. What we do know is she chose to cry during ""Memory"" instead of sing it, and because she was feeling it so intensely, the audience wasn't able to.

Francesca Hayward got a teeny-tiny ""introducing"" credit at the end of the film, but since she was the lead, I don't know why she wasn't marketed and congratulated for her first film performance. Miss Hayward is a ballerina, and while it's breathtaking to watch her talent and form, her beautiful face certainly competes with the rest of her. Her sweet expressions were lovely to watch; it takes a rare actress to communicate for an hour with only her eyes before she even speaks or sings a word. I kept wondering, ""Who is this girl? Is it Taylor Swift? Has she finally grown into her looks?"" Taylor Swift, only appearing for one song, was repeatedly plugged for starring in this movie, and I thought it was because she played the lead role. Francesca was lovely, and I'd love to see more of her work.

DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During Rebel Wilson's number, the camera flips upside down to watch the beetles march, and when the bugs dance on the cake the camera swirls a la Busby Berkeley, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""
1.0,21 December 2019,"I watch, at minimum, 95 movies each month. I've been doing that for the past 10 years. I'm retired, I have the time. Scuse me while I add that up. I have seen my fair share of 3s and 4s and even a few 1s. This production of ""Cats' is nowhere near that category. It never ceases to amaze how armchair critics, and even paid critics, can so casually look at a production that obviously to a lot of work to make and trash it as ""garbage"", ""a disaster"", ""a waste of time"" or any of the other many negative adjectives they use to describe something they themselves have neither the wherewithal, money, or connections, to ever make themselves. I often wonder what they would make if they had the talent to make anything other than negative, non constructive criticisms, of other people's labor and efforts.

Are there bad, awful, movies out there? Yes, Loads of them. But when you see 900+ movies in a single year you come to realize that it is not most of them. A lot a movies are average which does not make them bad. I have seen B movies, (I even call some of them B+ movies) that are as good as and even better than some 'A' movies rated highly here on IMDb.

But getting back to the negative 'Cats' reviews. It seems to me that what we are seeing here with all these 1s and 2s and ""I wish I could give it a 0"", ""now I want to die"", and ""what a waste of time"" ( although what else they had better to do...they never say), are as I described earlier ""armchair critics"" who are merely following the leader. An earlier review by some nameless, but paid critic, said the ""CGI made the movie creepy."" And sure enough you see that same description parroted here several times by people who can compare it to nothing other than the 'Broadway' version for how awful is. Followers following a leader without an original observation.

I'm glad I know better than to base every movie I see on the ratings given by people who expect every movie they see to change their lives. Now granted, Most of the 2s and 3s given here on IMDb are well deserved and I avoid them. A LOT of the 4s are 5s ( in my opinion) are really 5s and 6s and are really good, enjoyable, movies, if you are not only looking for Marvel Blockbusters or big budgets with big named stars. Every movie cannot be a Marvel Studios blockbuster or a Jason Bourne hit and star Anthony Hopkins or Robert De Nero.

This is all my opinion I know. And a lot of you will give 'me' a 1 or 2 for this essay. But there are some of you who will agree with me and like one person said, ""open a beer and enjoy the movie."" Those of you haven't seen 'Cats', give it a break and imagine how You would make it better if you could when you do see it. And keep in mind when the 'Wizard Of Oz' first came out some of the critics trashed that too. I'll bet anyone dollars to donuts in 25-30 years most people will not see 'Cats', as ""cat litter""."

The cast looked like they enjoyed themselves, and I'm glad someone did as it's the strangest musical I've ever seen and as much as you try to like it, it's doesn't happen. I feel sorry for the poor SFX team who must have worked their socks off, for zero return. This would have been way better if they had decided to make an animated version instead and at least it would have been guaranteed a viewing on CBBC. Shame."

The voices were fantastic. I never caught the dancers in a human pose. They were always up on toes and moving. This meant thousands of cuts as they held inhuman positions for a few seconds. FABULOUS. If you couldn't handle the unreality And ""lack of plot"" then go see Sonic the Hedgehog and Trolls which were previewed for a spring. Maybe animation and computer games are more your thing. Don't trash and hate."
5.0,4 June 2020,"After everything I've heard about this movie I expected something really bad.

Yet I was curious and wanted to experience it myself, in the end it still seemed interesting to me. Even if it's bad.

So I went in with the lowest of expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.

It's weird, strange, nonsensical and silly and I understand some does not like that, but to me it seems like exactly what a Cats movie should be.

The movie, to me, does a decent job at doing what it's trying to do. Be a movie based on Cats.

I think many that does not like the movie does not like, or if they haven't seen it, would not like, the original musical.

It definitely has plenty of flaws, but in the end I enjoyed it and I did not expect to.

I think it's more a matter of being very niche than being bad, even though it certainly isn't great either.

So if someone thinks the movie seems interesting but are hesitant to see it, consider giving it a shot, you may be pleasantly surprised, possibly. At the very least I was."

6.0,20 March 2020,"Cats Directed by Tom Hooper. Written by Tom Hooper and Lee Hall

I finally broke down and watched it. One of the most talked about movies for all the wrong reasons. It is an adaptation of a long running award winning Broadway play. It is a musical where the songs don't seem to leave a lasting impression. That's like a comedy with no laughs or a horror film that isn't scary.

I knew what I was getting into. I've seen the reviews. I've seen the trailers. I cringed and I cowered in fear. No time like the quarantine to see what this film had in store. Humanoid cat monsters changing size and weird camera angles and all the lovely shots of the fakest looking food ever caught on camera just coming out of the screen and going directly into my eyeballs.

I have no clue who watched the dailies of this and thought yeah this is going to work like gangbusters. Give me more money. I can make something unique. Unique is the right word for it but I'm not sure it's the right usage of unique they were hoping for.

There was no reason to make the cats CGI. None whatsoever. It was a case of could we do it but should we do it. You could have stuck with makeup and suits. It would have looked better that way. It was something done in The Island of Dr. Moreau. It looked marvelous in that movie. The CGI looks terrifying in this one. The human faces float separate from the bodies. The cats change size. The mice are humanoid. The mice are not just regular humanoids. They're basically played by children. The roaches are humanoid. Why are these things like humans? Not anthropomorphized but real life human versions of these monstrosities.

Cats is a musical so naturally the music is the most important component. Cats has a myriad of meaningless casserole-like songs. Nothing stands out. Nothing at all. I could not tell you one song. I wasn't humming anything. The only reason I know Memories is the cultural impact it has. I know more about Memories from Jersey Girl than the actual musical it comes from. The performers don't stand out either.

I would talk about the story but there isn't. It is a long series of introductions to characters we learn little to nothing about. The characters are essentially cyphers. They are merely vessels to carry some kind of tune. They are scary nightmare fuel singing and dancing. This movie is everything you've heard about and more. No amount of mind altering substances can help with this. It's okay to just let this movie fade from memory.... Memory... memory.

I give this movie an F."

5.0,5 April 2021,"I couldn't agree less with the host of hostile reviewers here!

I watched CATS for the first time today. I'd never seen the musical, and I'd only heard snatches of the poems as references in other works of fiction. I had low expectations (given the harsh reviews), but I found the movie charming. The CGI didn't bother me any more than AVATAR did (which is to say not at all).

Most of the criticism leveled here is really aimed not at the movie, but at the 1981 play and the T. S. Eliot poems. Of course the plot construction of CATS is not normal... The poems are the reason that each scene introduces a different archetypal cat (each one is a different poem about cat personalities), and why there are no character arcs, and only a bare bones overlying narrative structure (that's how the play organized the poems into a ""story"").

It's true some of the numbers ran too long and outstayed their welcome (notably Jelical Cats) but condemning a film simply because it's structure is not like every other movie is truly narrow minded, and leaves no room for variety in artistic expression.

Some of the savage criticism I've read here remind me of the many uncomprehending, brutal reviews 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY got when it premiered.

3.0,10 January 2020,"I decided, on my holiday in sydney, to watch cats as i had heard the reviews and knew how bad it was. but jesus christ, this movie was just bad in every sense of the word.

firstly, there was about five minutes of dialogue in the whole movie (as in, speaking to each other without singing a song). the only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because taylor swift looked hot as a cat, even if she was in the movie for ten minutes max.

secondly, characters in which the movie was advertised for (eg. taylor swift, jason derulo) we're hardly in the movie. the songs were genuinely terrible.

i didn't even understand the plot, not even when the movie was finished. nothing made sense and the movie seemed to drag on for eternity. i'd rather sit down for two hours and watch my fingernails grow than spend a dollar watching this disappointment of a movie."
3.0,6 July 2020,"Tom Hooper has become the Beethoven of cinema. His breakthrough CGI, presenting life-like creatures, is astounding. The script for this film is phenomenal. The cast must be so happy to have played a part in this. Following my fifth time watching this in cinemas, I divorced my wife so that I would have a better chance at getting with Rebel Wilson in her feline form. I also called my best friend, a well-known composer, to tell him that his music is garbage compared to the heavenly essence of Cats. Later that night, he shot my dog - but I'm not bothered because I'd rather have a cat. Meow!"
10.0,7 May 2021,No. The cats are terrifying and gross. Really just no substance no... anything. Just no.
7.0,20 July 2020,"There are several things that make the stage musical so enjoyable. It's got brilliant dance scenes, heart wrenching songs, impressive stage effects, costumes, and makeup. The plot really doesn't matter, and just serves as a devise to hear the songs and see the dances, but repeat viewers can find the relationships between the cats, and work out their histories and roles in the community. The movie decided to not include any of this. The editting during the dance numbers made them feel like a distraction from something else - I was focussed on the backgrounds and the fact that they were dancing, not the actual moves. The songs were turned into pop numbers, losing much of the emotion and making the emotion they did remember to include so over the top it felt insensere. The CGI was horrific and distracting. The jokes didn't work. I wish I could even laugh at it but I spent most of the movie bored out of my mind - please give me back my £4.50"
1.0,16 February 2024,"The film is an excellent adaptation; the dancing is graceful and lithe, the performances vibrant, the visuals excellently rendered (at least after the post-release redo), and several of the songs are iconic for a reason. The problem is that the source material is as shallow as a saucer of milk.

The musical was composed to feature songs about several different kinds of cats while the story and lore is only there to facilitate them. Unfortunately, the story and lore have a nugget of fascination to them. There's potential for an interesting tale here but instead the show wastes it's runtime on showpiece songs that are entirely the focus of inconsequential characters.

There was an oportunity with this film to elaborate on the worldbuilding, develop the important characters and their motives and backstories with some new songs and, in short, adapt the source material rather than mimic it and ultimately it leaves you with a feeling of wasted oportunity and time.

It perfectly achieves what it sets out to do and so It's fine, enjoyable even, as long as you allow it to be what it is - a showcase of songs about the different kinds of cats with a gossamer-thin plot."

It is pointless and the only redeeming value I can see is that it helped the people who worked on it pay their bills. I feel bad for the actors in this movie as for some of them, I believe it to be a low point in their career, sorry Dame Judy.

5.0,24 August 2022,"This movie... I just don't know. Just... no. It's so badly done and written, so confusing, dumb and strange. It got exactly what it deserved and more. Seriously, who thought the designs of cats specific to a naked human physique would be a good idea today? The visuals are at times just too bad, the idea works on stage but NOT on screen, some of the ideas of this world would never work if you think about it, and imagine what a dull, damning experience was it for an unsuspicious Cats fan to go to the theatre and look at all that for ALMOST TWO HOURS. I think that sums it up nicely. It's everything wrong with Hollywood in a gross, absurd and nonsense nutshell. Justice for Judi Dench and Ian McKellen."

1.0,28 December 2019,"I saw cats as a play many years ago and I did not like it. I was confused by it. Didn't understand it's simplistic plot and what all the music & dancing was about.

Now that I understand when sitting down to see the movie what is going on and what to expect I know and can accept that it is just a 1980s musical to sit back relax and enjoy for what it is. Nothing strange, nothing devious, nothing complex, just take in. Yes the CGI takes some getting used to but once you get beyond that and watch the dancing, hear the music (some of the riffs sounded like it came straight from Tron), and listen to the words it is actually rather an refreshing change from most of the crap in the movie theaters today.

So, get yourself in the proper mindset and go see this movie to make up your own mind about it. You may be pleasantly surprised as I was."

And this was simply inferior in every way. I can't think of any redeeming feature except Jennifer Hudson's memory was very passionate. No one except people who know Cats is going to watch it. So all of those who watch it will be disappointed. There is no reason to watch this if you don't know Cats. Or even just to pass the time on a tuesday. You will just be bored.

This film is not a 1, it's at least a 5 and if you imbibe in mind altering substances it might be higher.

But this was next level. This movie is just... bad. When I said they got the classification wrong, I mean this movie has unintentionally turned out to be a horror film. The way the CGI on the cats make them move is just... creepy. And I am used to looking a cats with four paws on the ground, not cats singing and dancing. I highly don't recommend, unless you want to see a movie that will forever change your mind on cats. I can't fully rate this because I would have preferred to watch my beautiful white wall than this. Go ahead and watch it if you are 15+ years old. You will never look at cats the same way !!

It's ridiculous. It's so weird it's almost absurd. But, like, that's Cats. That's what made the stage musical so popular. It's weird and inventive and consuming and transports you into this strange world. That's the point. That being said, I can see how just walking into this movie with no previous knowledge or experience with the musical would be a disturbing experience. If you don't know these characters or understand the basis of what they're doing, it is definitely like some weird acid trip. So to those of you debating on whether or not to watch, I say go for it! But maybe watch a few YouTube videos of the 1998 filmed stage version, or at least read a brief synopsis on Wikipedia. But also be sure to keep in mind that this musical broke boundaries and reinvented musical theatre when it was released. Did many people hate it/fear it? Sure. Is it one of the most popular musicals ever? Yup. Anyway, I found this film to be really enjoyable! I do think that a large extent of my joy was due to the fact that I'm familiar with the stage show, and it was really cool to see how they translated the stage version into a theatrical format. But overall, I found it enjoyable and even moving. But I also want to be clear and say that there were some very, VERY bad parts in this movie. Like, astonishingly awful. In particular, the scenes with Rebel Wilson and James Corden. (What were they thinking....? And the excessive fat jokes... Seriously?) But those ASIDE, i Honestly think that if you're willing to suspend disbelief, this is a perfectly good, entertaining, even MOVING movie. Yes, the CGI takes some getting used to. I eventually did. I thought Jennifer Hudson and Francesca Hayward shone in their roles! I loved the addition of their connection. Really powerful. And Robbie Fairchild KILLED it as Munkustrap. Seriously. He went so hard. I didn't really care for Judi Dench's performance. But I feel like, overall, the cast tried their best! The dancing was really good. When I finished this movie, I wanted to cry. Not really sure why. I don't think I've ever felt such a strange reaction to a movie before. I'm not even sure if this review made any sense but, look. Is it an awful movie? Yes. Is it a good movie? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Am I slightly ashamed of that? Definitely."
10.0,26 February 2024,"If you're expecting a plot, this isn't for you. If you think this musical has a moral to the story, this isn't for you. This musical is literally based explicitly on a book of poems about cats. Wiki describes it best: Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats (1939) is a collection of whimsical light poems by T. S. Eliot about feline psychology and sociology, published by Faber and Faber. It serves as the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1981 musical Cats. The live musical is awesome. It's magical. And at the end, kids can go up and meet the cast. I loved it. This movie was not what I expected. It needed a new director. New costumes. New cast. Big names don't make a movie. Correct casting does. Rebel Wison was my grandson's favorite in the movie. He lived Jennyanydots. Jason's cat reminded me of a stereotypical 70's pimp from Harlem. Horrible? That doesn't give it justice. It's sad. Whoever cast this should care more about who played the role best over the big name. Old Deuterotomy should have big a big old man with a deep voice like James Earl Jones. Not a British woman, even if I do love J. D. I could easily treat this apart but I won't. I loved the original which I watched. I loved the book. This is simply a book of poems put to music. It's not complicated. People are expecting more from it than it is. It's Broadway. Not everything makes sense. I have high hopes for Wicked movie. But I'll probably be disappointed. Fingers crossed it's better than this. For a better depiction, watch the 1998 movie version of Cats."
7.0,23 January 2020,Was it just me or was it not even that bad. If no one else is gonna give it a ten then I might as well
1.0,15 October 2020,"To begin with, the 2.8 out of 10 rating found here on IMDB at the time of this writing is a far greater commentary on how social media has changed the way people communicate, behave, and even think than it is of the film itself. The collected reviews of this movie should not be taken as a literal indictment of the film. Instead, it provides a singularly illuminating illustration of mob mentality in social media. Instead of hosting honest and accurate assessments of the Cats movie, this page has become a showcase for influencer wannabes sharpening their wit in an escalating competition for who can collect the highest number of likes by composing the most sarcastic and most popular 1-star review. Ironically, it seems less about rating a move than it is about people seeking to inflate their own self-esteem rating by berating an easy target.

Now, make no mistake, this movie is truly noteworthy in its capacity to break new ground in the category of awful. It simply doesn't deserve page after page of consistent 1-star reviews as far as the eye can see (or mouse can scroll). In fact, this reviewer might even go so far as to say that the film had moments, literal moments, where I was actually digging the ride. So here are the most significant flaws as this reviewer sees them:

1. Name over Talent - The mistake of believing that using big-name actors for curb appeal instead of appropriately talented performers. This is not intended as a backhanded slight on the talents of such icons as Ian McKellen, Judi Dench and others. Obviously, they are quite talented. Their career accolades are well documented and therefore do not need to be bolstered by an amateur critic. The intended meaning of this comment is to suggest that this movie amounts to a spit in the eye of all the talented singers and dancers that have performed this musical for 40 years.

2. CGI over Talent - Cats, above all other Webber musicals, stands out for its dancing. Sure, the songs are good, and the costumes are stunning, but this production has always been carried by the marvelous movements of its talented performers. The movie version should not need CGI to enhance anything in that regard. People can be amazing on their own.

Again, the very idea that it's better to create a character for Taylor Swift so that you can put her face on a poster instead of hiring real dancers/singers (again, not a slight of Taylor Swift. In fact, her singing here is excellent) is like hiring Audrey Hepburn to play the role Julie Andrews (one of the best movie/stage singers of all time) created in My Fair Lady and then bringing in Marni Nixon (another of the best movie/stage singers of all time) to overdub some of the singing.

3. Backstory and Comic Relief - As is so often the case, movie producers have underestimated the ability of an audience to handle any level of sophistication. The narrative Webber concocted to string together a collection of T.S. Eliot poems has always been a bit thin, but that never mattered. The show was entertainment enough. One can understand the desire to make rewrites when converting a book or play into a movie. The contrivances in this movie would almost have been tolerable if not for the lumbering and tedious performances of the titular comic relief delivered by Rebel Wilson and James Corden. This reviewer is actually surprised there hasn't been more outcry over fat-shaming, but laying that aside, the humor simply wasn't funny and dragged the movie further into the (spoiler) garbage can than it might otherwise have slipped on its own.

4. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella - This was, for me, the biggest disappointment Cats served up. One of the things that kept me going through the 2 sessions it took me to finish this movie on HBO Max was the anticipation of Hudson (one of the best Singer/Actors of the current generation) unleashing her pipes on ""Memory"". Alas, it was not to be. Without insider knowledge, it's hard to know where one should lay the blame for such a travesty. Producer? Director? Hudson herself? Whoever decided it was a good idea to 'act' this song instead of singing it should be blacklisted from the film industry unto several generations. How can anyone make a musical without so much as a basic understanding of the power music wields?! As a teenager when I first saw Cats at the National Theatre in D.C., I barely understood a bit of what was going on, but I understood that song even without knowing the words. Now, in my late 50s, just hearing the instrumental wind up to Memory can bring tears to my eyes. Imagine the anticipation of knowing that before this calamitous spectacle was over, there would be a chance to here Jennifer Hudson breath new life into this classic!

Imagine the devastation of hearing her cry, wheeze, whisper, and sob through every line!

Far be it from this reviewer to accuse an Academy Award winning actress of overacting, but the truth of the matter is that acting at all during the performance of this composition exceeds the boundaries of necessity and plunges headlong into the realm of crimes against art. Webber managed to capture every conceivable nuance of despair and heartbreak that might be associated with the character of Grizabella in the form of music and lyrics alone. By contrast, the movie Cats drowns the emotional impact of this song in a performance that evokes images of Carol Burnette doing a 5 minute death scene in one of her classic movie parodies.

To sum up: I find it extremely difficult to bestow a 1-star rating to a movie in which so many talented people obviously worked so hard. There have surely been many movies far worse than this one over the years.

But, yeah, it was pretty bad."
1.0,18 May 2020,
1.0,28 January 2023,"Even a mere three years after its release, it seems difficult to watch this movie for the first time with earnest detachment. Its reputation far precedes it as one of the worst box office bombs in recent memory and a target of merciless mockery and bafflement; in good humor, even its stars have made some unfriendly remarks in the time since. Combine one of the most bizarre of all plots among Broadway musicals (let us hope 'Starlight Express' never gets the Hollywood treatment) with character designs that were deemed unfeasible, in adaptation, for full-body costumes, but which in digital post-production immediately raise the specter of the ""uncanny valley,"" and this surely faced an uphill climb even before cameras started rolling. Factor in immediate and severe reactions from critics and audiences alike, and the one saving grace for a new potential viewer might be either total adoration of Andrew Lloyd Webber's piece for the stage, or near-total ignorance of it. For my part I readily admit that all I really know of 'Cats' is the almost ubiquitous song ""Memories,"" and a one-time reading of the plot synopsis that I found very curious. Sitting for this feature with low expectations but insubstantial foreknowledge, I tried to be as open-minded and objective as I could while watching.

I found myself pausing after the very first song, before even ten minutes had elapsed. I paused because I immediately understood what one friend had told me, which is that watching will make me feel like I'm on drugs. I paused because I immediately understood what I had been told by folks who, by a certain set of circumstances, had found themselves seeing the stage musical not once but multiple times, and walking away remarking that they didn't care for the music. I paused because in less than ten minutes I was bewildered, laughing hysterically in bafflement, confounded by the utmost assault on my senses, by the panoply of bombastic outlandishness that so readily greeted me. Very, very few have been those films to which I've had such a response. In less than ten minutes the impression has been cemented that in one way or another will last for almost the entirety of nearly two full hours: It's not that this is without value, but that value is overwhelmed by a combination of poor choices and nightmarish, flummoxing surrealism so extreme that the very question of quality, ""good"" or ""bad"" - let alone that value - is shuttled to the smallest, furthest corner of a vast room that bursts at the seams with kaleidoscopic, cacophonous inanity.

That value, to wit, includes the choreography (also applying in some measure to the ""training"" the actors supposedly underwent in the movement and behavior of felines), the stunts, and the singing skills of the cast, and to a lesser degree, their acting. Though they feed directly into the unswerving outrageousness of the perplexing spectacle, on a fundamental level I also appreciate the contributions of those contributing to the production design and art direction, and to the extent that it applies, the costume design and makeup work. I'll even go so far as to say that I appreciate, on a fundamental level, the work of the animators and effects artists, whose work was for better or worse essential to this rendition of 'Cats' as we see it. Of course, to consider the work of those animators and effects artists also rather demands one seek some knowledge of what was going on behind the scenes. It's on record, for example, that quickly after this was first released in theaters, the studio replaced theaters' existing version with a new one in which glaring errors in the CGI had been corrected. Yet it seems to me that this rather goes hand in hand with the profound, unremitting, inhuman pressure Tom Hooper accordingly put on the post-production artists to complete their work on an unimaginable time table. That this was apparently the same animation collective that had previously suffered the crunch of correcting the appearance of the title character in 'Sonic the hedgehog' that, having been dictated by producers in the first place, was swiftly met with enormous backlash - well, I don't personally place any blame on MPC Vancouver for this, either. If a world-famous sculptor is commissioned to chisel a slab of granite into a used litterbox, well, that's just what their work will represent. If that sculptor is made to in any way rush that work, the result will suffer. And so we have the visual presentation of this picture.

On the other hand: as someone who has never seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage work, and has minimal knowledge of it, I don't know how much of this 2019 movie is a direct reflection of the Broadway musical, versus how much is invention of adaptation by filmmaker Hooper and writing partner Lee Hall. What I do know is that these anthropomorphized cats (...and mice, and cockroaches) are peculiarly sexualized, not just in that the female characters are represented with human breasts but also in how characters, scenes, and some dialogue is written. Then there are those gags that are so condescendingly simple, and childish, that even a child would surely find them insulting, such as when Bustopher Jones lands on an object in such a way that his crotch impacts the surface. Both the sexualization and the more insipid gags are made worse by the design of the characters, an odd smashup of the believably real (as though whole physical costumes were used) and the dubiously fabricated (pure CGI) - with the unwelcome Uncanny Valley unquestionably being the final product.

It must be noted, furthermore, that whatever fun may be derived from the initial befuddlement does not last, and isn't ultimately the predominant tone. In contrast with, say, the introduction of Jennyanydots, spotlights given to other characters (Old Deuterotomy, Gus, or Grizabella) are more somber in nature. I'm pleased that some numbers and story beats actually do come off very well. Among other examples, never would I have assumed any such thing from 'Cats,' but ""Beautiful ghosts"" hits surprisingly hard; Bombalurina's big appearance, singing ""Macavity: The mystery cat"" is more of a mixed bag, but still is pretty swell overall; ""Mr. Mistoffelees"" is unexpectedly smart and heartfelt. However, whatever the mood at any given time, still it stands that many sequences range from well done but unremarkable (""Have you seen any other musical, ever? Cool, you've seen this."") to questionable and straining credulity - some sequences may boast both these flavors within their few minutes - to possibly unconvincing (including the finale, and even the reprise of ""Beautiful ghosts""). Moreover, the pacing is inconsistent, alternately lagging, rushing, or patchy, and this applies to the plot development, editing, and direction. Some choices of direction and cinematography come off as needless, questionable embellishment. And for all this, what heart and weight some elements of the tale should carry is more than not just rendered inert.

One could easily speak at still greater length of every little facet of this production, for there is so very, very much to take in over these two hours. I'll say this: I don't actually think 'Cats' is nearly as bad as its reputation portends. There are tidbits throughout that are actually kind of brilliant. The problem is that there's so much more that inspires major skepticism, other parts that don't make much of an impression at all, and some plain weakness. There's nothing inherently wrong with a picture swinging from bombast, to humor, to thrills, to sincerity, and back again; this does not do so believably. The feature is a sadly mixed bag in almost every way, a result stemming as much from Webber's original show as from the guidance of Hooper, Hall, and the producers, and other creative minds involved. No matter how well it's done in fits and starts, I find it difficult at any time to say that I downright ""like"" it, and I easily grasp why other viewers have reacted to the title with such denigration. There are, I assure you, far worse things one could watch; I've seen the bottom of the barrel, and this is nowhere near it. Still, this is probably the worst thing that some cast members have ever appeared in; sorry, Dame Judi Dench, and Sir Ian McKellen; sorry about your feature film debut, Francesca Hayward. And it's genuinely hard to conjure a situation in which I'd recommend this, for the viewing experience is so weird, and all over the map, such that I don't know who'd really enjoy it. Maybe 'Cats' is best reserved for those receptive to all the wide, wild, left-field possibilities of what cinema has to offer, and let's just leave it at that."
1.0,10 May 2020,I don't know how to review this. I loved the dancing the music was awfully sung. The costumes weren't bad hello they are cats... I wonder if They put better actors/singers in it if it would of made it better... I did find it amusing but could of been a lot better
5.0,12 September 2021,"I'm an avid IMBb user, reading reviews, watching trailers, always growing my watchlist, rating everything I see ... but this is the first time I've felt I needed to write at least a short review myself. Not necessarily because of the movie itself, but because of all the talk around it.

Let's be clear: this is not a good movie. It struggles in telling the tiny bit of story there is to tell. It's nonsensical in the way that's only enjoyable while intoxicated, if even then. It's so full of spectacle that it loses its effect, because once something's over we're already jumped by the next bit. There's a pun or a fourth-wall-break-like joke too many to keep any cinematic immersion up. Then, there's a lot of choices in for example how to do the CGI, how actors should act cat-like, etc., that just don't work. It all becomes a silly, all at once overwhelming and underwhelming, shallow, and to a large part boring movie experience.

But is it the worst movie ever made? No. It's just a musical movie that went too far in being a musical for people to accept it as a movie. That's my problem with ALL musical movies; they are rarely good movie experiences, but could be enjoyed as musicals on screen. Personally, I feel that in some ways this one works better than many other musical movies in that it goes so far in being an over-the-top musical, with technology allowing it to be more than a stage production ever could in terms of creative vision, that it actually warrants the kind of unnatural, quirky theatrics that otherwise make me cringe too hard to enjoy musical movies at all.

So, rather than just nodding along with ""Wth did I just watch 1/10"", a fair way to review this movie would probably be to recognise that it went all-out in being exactly the kind of musical mess it was intended to be all along, and that it made for a poor movie experience. Worst of all time? Not by far. Recommended? Definitely not."
5.0,22 December 2019,
1.0,15 January 2020,"Cats is a film I really wasn't looking forward to seeing. One reason is the immense negative reception around it. The second one is that I'm not a big fan of musicals as a whole outside of animated films. The only one I recall truly liking is Sweeney Todd. It's just not a genre that appeals to me too much. I'm especially not a fan of musicals like this where every line of dialog is sung. Though, I'll say it's more tolerable here than it was in Les Miserable. So, is this movie as bad as everyone says? In my opinion, no. At the same time, I can't say it's a great movie either.

There's not much substance to the film other than the musical numbers, revolving around the most bare bones of a story. The film is about our main cat getting tossed onto the streets and is taken in by this band of stray cats immediately after. All these cats are competing in this really vague competition where the winner gets to ascend to this higher realm. It's not very well explained. Other than that it's just our character moving from one set piece to the next, and one musical number to the nest.

On that note, the music is good. I can't compare it to the original play because I've never seen it performed. All the actors do a fine job in acting and singing, at least for me. There's some great talent in this film. The dance choreography was fine too. For me every song was fine, except the final number. The entire ending to this film is lame and unnecessary. The song is stupid, and you also have Judy Dench's character giving this speech to the audience on how to treat your cat; breaking the fourth wall it's awful.

By far, the best thing about this film is the look, mainly the set pieces. I especially love the look of the city with how dark and misty it is. It gives the film a great dark and mysterious atmosphere to it.

I wasn't as bothered by the way the film looked, mainly the characters, like most people were. Though there was one musical number involving mice and bugs, which are humanoid like the cats, which made me uncomfortable. I know if I were a kid watching this I would've been really uncomfortable. I think this should've maybe been Pg-13 rather than PG.

Ultimately, I think the creators made the wrong decision of how to approach this material. This would've been better as a straight up animated picture. Then people would've felt far less unnerved watching it. In the play you had people in cat costumes because it was a play. This is a movie with $100 million budget behind it. They could've done literally anything, but instead just tried to recreate the play as is with bigger effects and set pieces.

They should've made this a 3D, or better yet, a 2D animated film. This film would've been right at home back in the 90s when 2D animation was still prominent. There's a film from that time called Cats Don't Dance. This should've been made like that. I know Stephen Spielberg was going to make this an animated film out of this, but that fell through. That probably would've been better.

Also the main villain played Macavity played by Idris Alba was really lame. Throughout this entire movie he's built-up as this crazy villain. He even has a song dedicated to hyping him up. Not only are his motivations unclear, but he's foiled super easily.

Overall, Cats is an example that not all plays can be translated to film, at least not in the way they did it. The music and set pieces are good, and everyone gives a good performance. However, there's no real plot, the villain is weak, and the ending is lame. Again, this would've been better appreciated if this had just been an animated film."
2.0,25 May 2020,"Is CATS a good movie? Hmm... no. But if the question instead asked if CATS is a good piece of entertainment, my answer would be ""yes."" Cats isn't a movie that works as a standard three act play. There is no arguing around this. Standard movie structure does not work here. Cats is more of a spectacle, in the sense of being a performance that is a mixed cocktail of expression and visuals that are quite impressive and surprisingly organic in flow, but not following a proper plot exactly. Cats does have a loose story attached to it, but it isn't really a story proper. It's sort of like what someone might come up with if they took a nursery rhyme about cats and visually interpreted it into a movie. So having a plot that works is not really the point of the show. Contextually it works together well enough, but its story structure is whimsical, or perhaps figurative(?). If you go to see this movie with the expectation that all must fit into a the three act template, this will not work for you, which seems to be why Cats is being hailed as an unholy terror by thousands of internet experts idiotically falling over each other to come up with new way to proclaim this movie's failure.... But I actually think Cats is quite good, for the type of theater creation that it clearly is, so you should go into this with that type of presentation in mine, which is not many movie goers kind of thing. Even Disney musical fans might find Cats to be too light on plot, even though the visual creativity and choreography is often stellar.

Most of the scenes are whimsical and light, which makes the big dramatic scene feel a little top heavy. Most of of the show is cute and pretty, but ""light"" entertainment. Still, it does this specific job well. I would think kids under the age of four would really love this.

One thing I am actually annoyed with as far as the haters go, is how everyone keeps blathering about how terrible the CGI is, and this really irks me, because there is SO much bad CGI out there, and this is so far from being bad CGI that it just seems like people are dumb when they try to point this out. I'm not saying it doesn't look mesmerizingly strange to see people as cats, but if it wasn't for all the boo-hoo I had read about what a CGI abomination this supposedly is, I honestly would have thought all the actors was dressed in exceptionally good costumes. That is the truth. The roles in Cats are far from complex, but everyone plays them well. In fact, even though the bulk of her character is only displayed through facial expression and movement, I adored every minute of Jessica Hayward's performance. She was exactly what the role should be, and basically so was everyone else. I thought Taylor Swift seemed more than just a little bit superfluous, but she didn't undermine the movie in any way.

To end off here, I can't help but wonder if somebody important did not want Cats to happen, as a movie specifically. Either that, or maybe somebody just really has it out for Tom Hooper, because while I can understand Cats getting bad reviews for not have the consistency established as a ""good movie story"", it is also so far from being the monstrosity declared by every Tom, Dick and Harry. The cries of debauchery have been so outlandish that it has set off my spider-sense conspiracy warning... Cats just isn't what it is being panned as by critics. ""Bad movie""? Ok, fine. It is too fluid and abstract for many. ""Worst movie ever made""? Nope, not even close. Not even anything in this or any other parallel universes of bad movies. My suggestion: go see it with your 11 year old daughter, and this will help clarify the particularly rare and peculiar fun that Cats really is.

(BTW, If you want to know what the worst movie ever made is, it was a musical called The Apple, and it came out in 1980. Just be warned.)"
10.0,17 January 2020,"I watched Cats to understand the criticism around it. The play has been successful for so many years and I don't understand why the feeling about the movie is so negative. One criticism was that the cats' appearance is strange because you can see the human interpreting the cat... Well, that was true about the play too, wasn't it? The other criticism is that the story is weak. If so, that's also true about the play, right? In my opinion, the musical part could be more interesting (Andrew LLoyd Weber has written more interesting songs), but I did enjoy very much the way the cats interacted among themselves (very similar to actual cats), I liked the way their ears moved (also very similar to actual cats), and I heard an interview where the director said he wanted them to maintain their human appearance so that we could identify with them. All in all, I felt as if I was watching a play, and that was not a bad feeling at all."
7.0,3 July 2020,"Wow, just wow.

Quite possibly the worse film selection for our regular Friday film night with the kids.. 30minutes in and me and the son have abandoned it. There is a debate now between the girls as to who can withstand the torture the longest.

Avoid!!"
1.0,3 April 2020,"Quality cast. Best part of film was seeing big names like Idris Elba, Jason Derulo & Ray Winstone pop up. James corden was quite funny.

DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED"
1.0,21 April 2021,"This movie is literally the worst thing I've ever seen. I'm torn between feeling pity for the actors involved and disgust that they would willingly participate in this nonsense. It's not even so bad it's good, it's just bad. Really, really bad."
1.0,28 November 2020,"Having seen the actual stage production and growing up listening to the music, I knew what I was in for. However, while most of the singing and dancing is beautiful, some of it was pretty awful. Star power does not necessarily make for great singing. And as much as a love Jennifer Hudson, the snot dripping from her nose during nearly all of her numbers was a bit off putting. All in all, it was OK..."
1.0,28 January 2020,"Well, yeah the cgi wasnt perfect and the cats with human faces were just weird to begin with. But I have watched worse. In more recent and better classified movies. Deeper in the movie, it became acceptable. Almost normal. There were some good choreography and singing. It was different. In a all new level.

It's not a 2/10 movie, but in my opinion more of an 5/10. Hudson sounded unbelievable, her acting was amazing. Swift's cameo was fresh. And Wilson and Corden were themselves literally but it just kinda make everything glued back together.

Of course, everybody always jumps to attack what's not so expected right now, and the cats got they bullseye."
1.0,12 October 2020,"Okay, let's be clear. This movie was awful and I am a fan of musicals. It was not as awful as I expected though and I suspect a lot of people who hated it never saw the play Cats. Let's be clear. The play was vastly superior, but both were about people in cat costumes singing songs. The songs were fine. Nothing wrong with the songs (except Rebel Wilson). Admittedly, I played video games on my phone while watching this. This may be overly generous, but I think the director was trying to do something artsy and just flat failed. I suspect I would have given it one more store if I had fast forwarded through Rebel Wilson's scenes. Some things can't be unseen."

On the other hand , 2019 was a crazy year, COVID crazyness... Also reminds me that the first time people watched swan lake, they also didn't like it, and now it is classic... I was raised on movies like that, and we were going to ballets musicals like that for kids. And we weren't scared. So maybe I have a different perspective..."
8.0,9 August 2021,"I don't get the hate, if you loved the musical and enjoy the songs it is worth a watch.

2.0,30 November 2020,"It's definitely not the worst movie of all time, as many people claim. However, I can appreciate the sentiment. It has zero charm, except the song Memory. I know the stage musical was an unsurpassed hit, and watching this you feel that it would indeed be a good stage play. However, as a movie it's a wreck.

Upon the terrible early reviews, the director claimed he was rushed for a quick release, especially in the fx department, and later released an edited version. Honestly, the special effects are the least of the problems with this. I won't even go into the acting, the pacing, the lack of plot or story etc. My main problem is, why make this movie? Who actually thought anyone would want to see this? Honestly, why? It's not funny or entertaining, or remotely interesting. You could just stand on a street corner and look ahead for an hour, you're likely to see more interesting stuff than this movie. And that's not a smart aleck comment, that's the sad truth.

I said I won't even go into the acting, the pacing, the lack of plot or story, but I will go into the photography. Not only is this a terrible movie, but it also ""looks"" terrible. The lighting and the sets are the worst I've seen in a long time. It looks like an 80's MTV music video set, and a very cheap one at that.

A very weak effort overall, with a lot of money and talent wasted. It makes you wonder about the people in Hollywood, not only those who come up with these ideas, but also about those who approve them."
4.0,17 February 2020,"The film deserves a 5, it wasn't terrible and it wasn't amazing! Yes the CGI wasn't great at times however I had fun watching this film. Loved the music and would definitely watch it again."
1.0,8 June 2020,"I finally watched Cats after being pre-biased for months to expect a massive failure. As I watched Cats, I kept asking myself, ""So where are the bad parts?"" After the movie I had to ask was this movie really that bad and could not really point to any mistakes justifying under a 4/9 so it received a 5/9. I believe the problem is Cats by nature is a silly concept and based on poetry. Add on to that music, singing, dancing, and many characters popping in and out of the plot and it is befuddling. I had the good fortune to see it on DVD with captions so I was able to replay scenes until they made sense and then move forward. As for the actors and scenery, compared to other Broadway/film made over the decades, they did pretty good as expected so that was not the problem. Again it comes down to the concept being silly and if you try too hard to overthink it; you will end up not liking this film. On the other hand, if I had been prepared with a better grasp of the plot and the characters, I would have given Cats a 6/9, because there are some good/evil metaphysical bits going on in the background that would likely show that Cats is not so silly. But I watched it once and found it was a fair musical undeserving of being slammed so hard by the reviews."
3.0,25 July 2021,"The only question I have is why in the hell this amazing star studded extremely talented cast did this movie, WHY???????? Even the great Judi dench couldn't bring anything to that film, the costumes are downright scary yet it's not a horror film. It's a film you have to see it's like watching a train wreck or accident you cant help but look!!"

1.0,29 December 2019,"I think of you have seen the stage play, which is really just a collection of poems and songs put together, then you are far more likely to like this. If you have not seen the stage show it must be baffling, as there is no attempt to make the story into a film.

Even given this, there are some pretty disappointing performances. Given the greatness of some of the songs and some of the singers there was a recipe for an amazing soundtrack but sadly it fell well short of that.

It is worth a watch if you understand it is just a collection of songs and some dancing but sadly don't expect the blockbuster it was meant to be."
10.0,5 January 2020,This movie was beautifully made. Excellent singing and dancing. The sets were phenomenal. I was entranced through the film. I loved it. A movie I can watch several times over.
6.0,19 May 2022,I must be one of very few who actually loved this film despite the awful reviews! It seems the majority of those who hated it have never actually seen the original musical. If they had they'd know to expect awful mis-rhyming and lyrics because that's all part of the charm. I think it still has the magical feel of a Andrew Lloyd Webber theatre production which I think was maybe the point? It's not amazing but still fun to watch and sing along with :-)
1.0,25 January 2021,"I don't know how exactly, but I'm pretty sure, with the timing of its release, this ""movie"" is at the root of all this mess we're in with COVID right now."
4.0,27 January 2020,"Cat's is funny at times though mostly boring. The camera angles constantly change, thereby creating a feeling of confusion with the viewer. There are too many fragments edited into one scene, making all other experiences of the songs stand out as quite incapable to be loved or even appreciated. Big names are used to sell this celluloid crap, but if you have a bit of self value you simply leave the room long as this is on."
5.0,1 February 2021,Incredibly boring. Bad storytelling. Bad CGI. Uninteresting dialogue and set pieces. Terrible direction. Terrible writing. Music was fine. Baffling choices on every front.

5.0,10 April 2020,"Cats (1.5 out of 5 stars).

Cats is a musical fantasy movie based on a play which i never saw. I am curious if the play is way better adapted than how the movie is. Where to start. The opening sequence was good. It had a beautiful musical score. And it falls from there. The musical numbers are boring and forgettable. The plot is thin or barely expressed the story. The direction tries to be colorful with the production and visual effects of the actors as cats. But it looks cheesy. I did had trouble recognizing some of the actors. Except for the obvious ones. This is one musical film that runs too long and uses up its welcome of trying to enjoy it. It is just one musica sequence after another and gets very boring fast.

Overall, Cats is one of the worst films this year. The plot is thin. The cast is forgettable. The visual effects seems cheesy and incompleted. The musical sequences is boring. And the direction seems lost through a variety of musical set pieces with no substance."

6.0,21 December 2019,I saw it on Broadway and also the touring show. I love this musical and thought the performances were good. I truly don't care about the fur not being a costume- the music is what carries the show. There were some really slow sections which is why I didn't give it full stars but those are my least favorite songs anyway. I can understand why some people won't like it but I enjoyed it.
1.0,11 April 2020,This is so bad that you just have to watch. My kids and I laughed through the whole thing.
1.0,21 May 2020,"I like musicals, I really do, but ""Cats"" is not a musical, it's a ""dancecal"". If you are watching a musical you expect the play to be focused on the singing, and obviously there is some dancing (or not) involved, but ""Cats"" is just a bunch of bad cgi cats doing ballet moves and it happens to be singing, or more accurate, repiting the ""jellco"" word waaaaaay too much. If you swap ""jelico"" with ""smurf"", and paint the cats in blue, you get a smurfs dancing crew."

1.0,13 May 2020,
2.0,16 November 2020,"I have nothing against Cats. But it doesn't work as a musical movie. It's a theatre production. The story isn't even important. Cats has always been about the dance numbers. And the dance numbers didn't disappoint in this, I'll say that. Actually those were probably the best parts: the professional dancers, the non ""famous"" people did better than the Big names. The CGI was just atrocious and honestly ridiculous. Idris Elba's Macavity was the worst look wise. Broadway make up was fantastic! This movie could have gone amazing in the costume department! The CGI just wasn't necessary! Memory was disappointing... it's a melodic song and Hudson cuts it up into too many pauses, and makes it overly dramatic, more than the song already is. She acts it instead of singing it, same that Anne Hathaway did in Les Mis. Of the famous names Taylor Swift was actually the best, Jason Derulo I couldn't understand. He needs to articulate better. Rum Tum Tugger is a difficult song sure, but I've heard better. The famous names were simply unnecessary, they didn't add anything special. You're better off watching the Broadway filmed production."

The score was always good, and may be an acquired taste, this is no different. The cast were always dressed as cats in odd suits, this is a cgi'd version. I was entertained, not bored and have seen many worse this year... Hellboy, MIB International and Crawl for example. Don't be swayed by trolls, if you're a Lloyd Webber fan, you'll be pleasantly surprised."

What is rebel Wilson doing? Is that the guy from taxi-Ing celebs, puking a hairball over Ian McKellen? Why? What is happening? Please end it! I don't want to watch TV ever again. I am sad.

1.0,22 December 2020,What can I say that hasn't already been said here....... 1 star..... and that's kind.... I won't waste my time with 1000 reasons I turned this off in the first 15min
2.0,6 November 2020,"I'll admit. When I first saw the trailer, I was actually pretty intrigued. Am I a weird guy? Maybe. Was I weirdly turned on by some of the cat people when I watched the trailer? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. Plus, the orchestral iterations of two of the major themes from the musical were kind of amazing sounding. I decided I'd watch it in theaters. I thought, ""Maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised by what I see, considering how strange it looks.""

But something else happened.

Within 2 minutes, I immediately knew this was going to be one of the worst films I'd ever seen in my life. It was so off. So awkward. So strange that the cats no longer appeared attractive to me anymore. And did they have the songs redone to be more orchestral? Nope. They actually kept all the songs sounding like the same 80s songs they had always been. Sythesizers and all. The CGI? Unfinished. There were even portions of animation that weren't completely rendered that were allowed into the final cut. When they danced, there were multiple times I literally watched as their feet didn't connect with the ground below them correctly, indicating the set they were on wasn't actually there. There were parts where you could tell the faces of the actors that were rotoscoped onto the CG-motion-captured bodies of themselves sometimes slightly *moved out of place*. I've told all these things to the people I've known who asked me how it was, and they generally responded around the lines of, ""Ah. Dang. Well, I'll definitely not see it then."" And I always responded:

""No. You have to see it.""

The reason you have to see it is because it's so inherently bad that it's actually a marvel, like watching ""The Room"", or ""Troll 2"". It's an experience that everyone needs. But I strongly recommend you watch it with friends and/or family. You'll laugh. You'll cry (at how awkwardly bad it is). You'll be amazed at how the cinematography and lighting are actually phenomenal, but unfortunately lighting a film that just... doesn't deserve it. ...or maybe it does. Maybe that's what makes this film so fascinating; it's like if director David Fincher and cinematographer Simon Duggan joined forces to shoot a 4 year old running around with action figures and talking about how Play-Doh tastes.

It must be seen at least one time. It's truly a film to be remembered. I mean, who knows. Maybe it'll go on to become a cult classic for just how bad it is. But again: must be watched with other people. If you watch it alone, you'll just feel weird the whole time. If you watch it with friends though, you'll all feel weird.

Together."
1.0,26 December 2020,"Curiosity got the better of me and had to see it for myself and yes, it was as bad as the hype suggested it's like watching a rubbish snapchat filter the CGI is so bad, I don't think its a spoiler saying its as painful as piles. 1 star now seems generous."
8.0,19 December 2021,"I didn't see this in the theater because of the horrible reviews. It was my loss.

If you are an Andrew Lloyd Webber fan you will love this. I've seen every incarnation, 2x on the stage, and probably 5 films of the stage production.

My biggest criticism has always been not being able to hear the lyrics by T S Elliot. In this film, you understand every word.

Costuming on the stage is softened by sheer distance from the audience. People complained costumes were freakish in this film. Once you get used to them and with an open mind, they can be quite beautiful.

Francesca Hayward is an astonishing dancer, and Jennifer Hudson, Judy Debt (sp), and Ian McClellan put in fabulous performances. Strange that they had such bottom billings. Cats takes its place alongside Phantom, Evita and the rest. You will be happy iyou gave it a try."
7.0,29 December 2019,"Cats definitely doesn't deserve the panning it received, yes there are flaws but let's face it, if you visit the cinema expecting anything less than humans dressed as cats, singing and dancing, what do you expect? The storyline is ridiculous as is the concept but allow yourself some escapism and enjoy the unbeatable songs and dance routines. Pros, Jennifer Hudson absolutely nails Memory, Francesca Hayward has the most beautiful cat face and exquisite dancing, Jason Derulo is a fun rum tum tugger and James Corden and Rebel Wilson provide something light hearted humour. Cons: CGI is very obvious at some points in particular the opening scene, skimble shanks and the closing scene, some songs are sang in the wrong key and the bass and amplification of some songs don't pronounce it in the best way. Taylor Swift doesn't appear natural dancing as a cat (I know this is a ridiculous sentence even as I write it) but she appears awkward dancing, shoulders too high and stiff, the stupid shoes don't help. Judi Dench's casting is also pretty bizarre, Old Deuteronomy usually played by a man, fair enough if she had an amazing voice but seems pretty pointless otherwise."

5.0,26 December 2020,"What could've been an amazing film has been turned into a horror story of dreadful CGI, out of proportion to their surroundings 'cats' and in some instances the murdering (Mungojerrie & Rumpelteaser anyone?) of what is a fantastic soundtrack. Why on earth they didn't stick to the original stage costume design and makeup & go for this CGI monstrosity is anyone's guess. My 10 year old loves the 1998 version and has a children's version of TS Eliot's poems on which Cats is based but he refused to watch this film based on the trailer alone. Says it all really!"

9.0,8 January 2020,"This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. So your probably wondering why I gave it 10 stars. No I am not a bot, and I was not paid. I just really enjoyed it! It's so bad! The CGI is terrifying! There are other creepy animals in it too. There is snot coming out of Jennifer Hudson's nose the whole time she's singing! Rebel Wilson is rolling around on the ground. Judy Dench looks evil, and has a monologue that never ends. It's over all one gigantic mess. And there is really weird dances involving the cats tails! The movie is just so cringeworthy.

But with it all put together it's AMAZING! I couldn't stop watching. It's entertaining! And when I say it's the second coming of Rocky, I mean I could see it being a cult classic. Because, at least for me when I saw it, the entirety of the audience was clapping, laughing, singing, and yelling at the screen from the beginning to the end of the movie. It was SO much fun! I gave it a standing ovation, I loved it so much! I would totally go see it again!

I normally do not write reviews, but I wash just blown away with what I saw. And remember ""Cats are not Dogs""!"
7.0,28 December 2019,After reading countess reviews about how awful it was I still spent the money on a movie ticket to see what the outrage was about. Now after watching it I felt compelled to write a review. It's not nearly as bad most reviews have made out. Now I'm certainly not going to tell you it's a great movie but it does have some positives. First and foremost it's a musical and it plays like a theatrical performance rather than a movie. It's quirky and odd in parts and feels disorganized and amateurish in others. However if you can make it through the first half of the movie then your treated some great performances and musical numbers towards the end.
3.0,13 May 2020,"It is official. This movie has surpassed ""The Room"" as the worst movie ever made. I did not think that was possible. I am in absolute awe. This is a truly frightening fact. When I saw the trailer I knew it was a contender. Sorry Tommy your reign of 16 years has ended."

Cons: It felt like the only characters remotely connected were Victoria and Mr. Mistofolees. All the other ""cats"" felt disjointed. I understand the complaint about the way the cats were CGId, but it didn't take away from the film. The biggest let down was needing to over-explain the plot and using Rebel Wilson and James Corden as ""comedic"" relief. Because they were not comedic in the least. Both their songs turning disturbing and gross real quick. I just wish the producers/directors of this film would've done better for such beautiful music."

I disagree with most ""critics"" and generally pretty forgiving if a movie tries to be good, but good lord this movie ignored every instinct, every spirit or soul this story has to tell. Everything could've been bearable, but this director is tone deaf artistically. The music and voice direction is soo bad. The characters looked so awful. The soundtrack was COMPLETELY SOULLESS. What the Hell? How could this movie make it so far into production without anyone saying anything? F'ing travesty and not worth my time. Les miserables was a fluke. Director probably got lucky then.

7.0,25 December 2019,"I cannot quite fathom why people hate this movie. It is peculiar in its special mix of stage artificiality and movie tricks, the story makes as much (little) sense, as in the stage show, the look is unusual and not everything works, but we were entertained. Btw, our group included real fans of the musical able in principle to sing along the main tunes."
2.0,4 August 2020,"When I went to go watch the movie, just to see what all the fuss was about, I can honestly say that I have never had such an experience watching a movie before, and probably never will again. Normally, the cinema is quiet, aside from the rustling of chip bags, or crunching of popcorn, but In the event of Cats, everyone was talking, laughing and opening commenting on the movie as it was showing, this didn't take away from the film, as well. you cant take anything away from 0, but i thought it interesting, and it stands as one of the very few movies where upon the end, a round of applause was given, not to the movie makers, but to ourselves, for making it through the movie, without walking out, or trying to choke ourselves out with popcorn."
2.0,16 April 2020,This was weird and boring! None of the movie made sense! We watched it all and couldn't figure out why we did that. It's awful! Taylor Swift actually looks amazing tho!

I just know something I had once is now missing. Maybe it's any hope that the entertainment industry isn't first gen Nephilim back from Sheol. I saw the play in '98 Chicago. I didn't care for it. But I thought I'd try again in film format. Well, there went $50 on the drinks needed to flush the experience down the sewer properly."
5.0,16 January 2021,"Regardless of how you feel about the original piece of musical theatre, for which I have no strong feelings toward, the songs and set-pieces don't damn this movie so much as the visual choices. I think the point that we are currently in as far as CGI goes is that the technology has advanced to the point where it's the most sensible, spectacular choice, but not far enough to surpass the threshold of the uncanny valley. And this movie is really, really uncanny. With every scene, the creeping impulse that makes you scream ""WHY?"" is compounded with every visual, every proportional disruption, every lapse in CGI artistry. If you were stand in packed auditorium, and everyone were to start yelling, an effect that overloads your senses, at some point you would revert to a fight-or-flight impulse, and that is what this movie did to me. Despite being at home, I had the urge to claw through my chair's plastic armrest through the film. I couldn't process so much chaos into meaning.

The shame is that this movie could have been saved through retreating from the impulse of virtual effects, back to a more acceptable visual of actors dressed in cat costumes. The movie might be mediocre, but there's no quality assessment that can be processed beyond the visual terror of cats with human faces, human hands, human feet, and human clothes. Horrifying."

It was entertaining, the music was brilliant as was the dancing, what were these reviewers wanting a stage show on film! I wasn't keen on on the stage show, but this version was much better. It was well made and very clever how they did it when you watch the bonus extras."
2.0,13 February 2020,"The sets were beautiful and fitted quite perfectly into the film, most of the actors did a good job in not just terms of dancing and singing but also in terms of acting, the story was not to simple and not to complicated and the people who say there isn't a story probably doesn't even know what a story is, the story is that there is a ball that certain cats can compete in and the winner gets a new life and than there is a cat that isn't allowed to compete because he isn't like all the other cats so he tries to cheat his way into winning the competition by kidnapping the cats that were competing. The music was great, some of the characters were actually quite likeable and had a backstory and the only real reasons why people are calling this film terrible is because they attention spam didn't last, the cats doesn't look that great and that it's popular to hate on it."
1.0,26 December 2019,"It wasn't the best movie of the year but it wasn't the worst of the decade either. If you've seen the stage version you might agree that both are fairly slow in pace. Jason Derulo was fun to watch. Rebel Wilson was goofy as expected. James Corden played a comic relief so he wasn't epic but was entertaining. Speaking of epic, however, Ian McKellan earned that description with his cameo appearance. Taylor Swift was ok but Catherine Zeta-Jones woulda been better.

I wish they had a 3D version but since they don't, I recommend seeing it but waiting for a home version. I also recommend seeing the live version if you ever get the chance."

By the way this is isn't the worse movie of all time. I have seen the worse movie of all time and it is called, ""The Ganzfeld Experiment.""

I was surprise Judi Dench and Ian McKellen were dragged into this film. They should really fire their agents.

The only good thing about were the musical performances by Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift.

I read it was originally intended to be animated and should have stayed the course. It could have been another ""Aristocrats"" or at least a second cousin version of ""Gay Purr-ee""(1962)"
1.0,19 April 2020,"Turning a musical into a movie isn't easy, but when it's done right it can capture the essence of the original in a way that can't be conveyed on stage. Unfortunately, this Cats movie is a musical crammed into a movie with all of its life drained in the process.

The easy critique of Cats is that it looks ghastly, and it certainly does. But it goes beyond the unsettling human-like cat animation. Everything is caked in so much CGI that all the dancing and movement of the movie feels dampened. The colors are all washed out and the cats don't stand out from the bleak settings they inhabit. Sometimes I don't even know where I'm supposed to be looking because there's nothing dynamic.

The awkwardness of the artificial fur coating hampers any funny or touching moment - it's like there's a hairball stuck to any sentiment in the movie. That's not to say there's much to feel... the characters are just props to eek out the songs one by one until the checklist is done. There's certainly no real story, which you can attribute to the original musical but isn't helped at all by the film. From the moment it starts you are tossed into this bizarre-looking and exceedingly unpleasant world of which there is really nothing redeeming.

On top of the yucky visuals and flat characters, the camerawork is stubbornly rigid. You never feel pulled into the flow of dances or emotions - it feels more like a camera is set up to film a freak show for reality TV. It's almost as is the director is conscious of what a mess is taking place, but they're reporting on it rather than trying to evolve it.

In my opinion, Cats is just as bad as the reviews say. But it's not just because of the initial shock of the way they've chosen to render the cats. Even if you give it your best try, it's difficult to watch this movie and find something to like."
1.0,2 December 2020,"Within the first 5 minutes I turned it off. It looked horrible, creepy and all. No one asked for this movie. Should've left it where it belongs... on Broadway. I can't believe while making this no one said we should stop, this is stupid"
1.0,22 November 2020,"Maybe worse than that, it could be described as the worst big budget Hollywood production to date; for the estimated budget of 95,000,000 dollars, this offers the audience absolutely nothing other than unreasonable and unwanted horror.

The CGI, for just being a year old, is shockingly awful. I remember for a decade now I have been teaching and speaking about how CGI and overuse of bluescreen is to be the death of cinema; and here we are. Not only is trash like this created by a team of completely clueless people who are unqualified; the production company wanted it like this. How can that be? Even Disney are remaking all their classics and turning them into CGI bluescreen pieces of trash that not only cost a fortune, but also strip out all the meaning and storytelling that the classics offered.

Now then, this movie in particular is gross to look at. The cats look strange and creepy, the motion capture isn't quite right and the bodies sometimes feel detached from the heads. A team of performers and some decent costumes and makeup could go a long way, like as we have seen in some amazing productions lately. But we get some gaudy CGI that looks like some cheap knock off of what could be done 15 years ago with Pixar's 'Toy Story'.

The plot is garbage, the acting is so poor. The music is awful, and none of the cast can sing. I can say that much, prepare your ears as well as your eyes.

Lastly, this movie moves at the pace of mud, or at least as a viewer it feels like it drags on for 4 hours; yet only being 1 hour and 45 odd minutes.

1/10 everyone in hollywood has lost their minds."

I watched this in an empty theater and had to scream at one point just to allow myself to remember that there were things outside of this movie. I write this review as I watch it for the second time with some friends. I can feel it ripping my soul away.

1.0,24 December 2019,"I was always optimistic about watching Cats and, despite the horrendous debut of the trailer and the months of hatred people poured in to the film without seeing it, I am very glad that I took the time to watch it. As a fan of the stage production, the plot (which some ignorant people seem to think is non-existent?) was already apparent to me which I honestly do believe is a big factor of why I enjoyed the film as much as I did. It seems that a lot of people are going in to this film without knowing anything about it which, of course, is going to mean that they will have trouble getting to grips with what is put in front of them. However, the film does well to portray the story to anyone willing to take it in, which I presume a lot of audiences haven't been prepared to do which is a huge shame. The casting, albeit including the ever-underwhelming James Corden, were fantastic; Dame Judi Dench was phenomenal, Sir Ian McKellen played Gus superbly and what a turn for Francesca Hayward who was simply stunning as Victoria, leading us, through the evening of wonder with the Jellicle cats. Victoria is supposed to represent us, the viewer, just as this strange and wonderful world is completely new to us, it is also completely ew to her and I really just wish that people were more open to embracing this world than being so abrasive instead. I watched this film with two friends who had no idea about what they were about to watch. At the start, they seemed to be put off and were making little jokes about how ""bad"" the CGI was and how they didn't know what was happening but then they allowed themselves to get lost in to the film and ultimately enjoyed it. Something that I believe everyone could do, if they really give this film a chance. Cats will become a cult-classic that will go down in history, not as the worst musical ever made, but as the most misunderstood film ever made. Please don't let the negative reviews taint your viewing of this film. Don't let the over critical critics, the same ones that told us that Ad Astra and Crawl were some of the best films of 2019, dictate to you what is a ""bad film"". Make your own choice, see this super imaginative, totally out-there film while you can."

I still found it enjoyable despite its many downsides."

2.0,22 December 2019,"I thought the actors and singing did a good job of capturing the characters and performing the songs from the original musical. One of the too complaints has been about the CGI however, in my opinion, it would be very difficult to carry off a movie like this using real costumes (like in the musical) and I don't know what they would have done without a CGI background (which I thought was incredibly well crafted and contained a lot of detail) Overall, I think people have judged this movie too harshly. I felt it had a fantastic atmosphere that you hope for with any musical of this calibre and that the costume animators did the very best they could to create something appropriate for the silver screen."
3.0,24 December 2019,"This movie is not nearly as bad as the reviews I've read say. Yes, the feet were weird, they should've left the feet alone. Other than that I loved it.

It was more tolerable because of the set design and makeup. That is lost in the film version. And the size ratio between the set and the ""cats"" was annoyingly off. For instance, the mice were the size of flies around the cats, but the cats looked like mice beside a stove.

Anyway, I did not like Phantom when I saw the stage production because I had no idea what was going on. However, I LOVE the movie and now appreciate the stage version. I watched this movie thinking it would change my mind about CATS. Nope, I still think it could only be enjoyed high."
1.0,23 December 2019,One of the best films I have ever seen. Never have I loved a movie so much. All the actors were astounding they did Oscar worthy performances. The CGI was by far the best part. In conclusion this movie is a masterpiece and in my opinion should be nominated for best picture

4.0,13 June 2020,"Let me first say I've never seen the play and I believe that might be the key to enjoying this movie. With that said, I did not enjoy this movie. I'm not sure if my expectations were too high or if I just wasn't aware of how nonsensical it was going to be. I was looking forward to watching it for a couple reasons: one of them being Idris Elba and the other being the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber. However, I kept putting it off because I am one of those rare people who finds Taylor Swift absolutely loathsome! I don't understand how she still has a career because she isn't that great of an actress and her vocals aren't much better but I digress. This movie started off weird with a song that didn't make much sense and then went downhill from there. I thought it would be cute to see humans dressed up as and playing cats but it actually turned out to be quite creepy and unsettling. I grasped the main plot point of the movie was a cat would be chosen to be ""reborn"" into a better life but after 30 minutes or so not much more information was given about it other than why some cats thought they deserved it. I'm not sure if the movie got any better after the first 30 minutes because I shut it off. I am not the kind of person to turn off a movie without trying to make it all the way through or at least halfway but I just could not do it. If you've seen the play, then I believe there is a good chance you'll enjoy the movie. If you haven't, then I would say don't even bother with trying to watch this."

Cats has always been a borderline surreal fever dream that takes people out of their comfort zone. People who resent that probably aren't fans of the original work either. If you enjoyed the theatre production, trust me that this film does it justice.

They took large risks, and it was everything I wanted to be. Alien, saturated, and impressionist. If you can appreciate art, you'll appreciate this."
1.0,3 August 2021,"A lot of people said this movie was terrible, correctly. They were dead on about this movie and how bad it was. But also Cats is faintly super sexual, because the Broadway musical was SUPER sexual, like it was built into the play that fit men and women in skin tight leotards would cavort and strut and gyrate for like however long the musical was and now also the movie. Whatever Cats is supposed to be about, whatever that half right meaning might be, also Cats is about sex- specifically the sex the performers had after each showing of Cats! On Broadway! Cats! See it for the first time, again!"
1.0,9 November 2020,"I don't like to use the word flawed when talking about movies, but sometimes it's unavoidable. Cats is deeply, deeply flawed. It's the sort of flawed that makes the movie's mere existence a flabbergasting paradox, leaving one with questions about the layers and layers Tom Hooper had to work through to get the $95 million to produce and release such a broken, ill-conceived piece of cinema. He convinced studio executives, producers, production designers, and visual effects supervisors that his idea was a good one, and it was bad from the start.

Musical theater is, let's face it, a niche medium. The biggest show last year, The Great White Way, was attended by 350,000 people total throughout the year. By comparison, roughly 100,000,000 people saw Avengers Endgame in theaters in 2019. On top of that, musical theater is a vastly different medium from cinema. What can work as spectacle in a closed theater won't necessarily work as spectacle on a movie screen. I can imagine the effect a live performance of Cats would have on the musical theater lovers of the world. The sights and sounds of people dressed up as cats running up and down the aisle and swinging around in front of them is probably rather enticing. I don't really think it would work on me personally, but I sort of get it.

That doesn't mean that it will translate to cinema where we've been inundated with spectacular sights for decades. People looking like cats and singing showtunes is mundane when compared to the worlds of Pandora or Middle-Earth. There's no spectacle here in comparison to what we're used to. That's really just looking at the idea generically, though. In practical reality, Tom Hooper took the exact wrong approach to the movie's visual effects.

The stories of the visual artists working 90 hour weeks and sleeping under their desks to finish the complete film's special effects in just four months are on the IMDb trivia page, and the quick work is exceedingly evident on screen. There's almost never a single shot where the movement of the cats doesn't look janky in some way. Arms move wrong. Whenever the cats dance, they seem to jump between frames. There are even copious moments where heads seem disconnected from bodies. Even the musical numbers, in particular the dancing, feels too smooth and then too jerky at the same time, invalidating what must have been very good work by the performers with a bad layer of digital paint that's impossible to unsee. Every character on screen for the entire one-hundred minute runtime falls firmly in the Uncanny Valley and never escapes it. Every minute of this movie feels wrong just looking at it, and that's the biggest source of audiences' problems with the film. Someone, at some point, should have made Hooper use practical costumes and makeup.

Here's the thing, though, the story underneath, even if they had fixed the special effects, is pretty much non-existent. It's spectacle designed for musical theater, and all it is amounts to a series of songs of different cats singing about themselves in a row. There's no real story, and the enjoyment factor of the audience entirely hinges on their desire to hear music. It reminded me of Francis Ford Coppola's Cotton Club where the point was the recreation of the physical space and the music that went with it. There was a story, but it was unconvincing and unimportant. Coppola was only interested in the music. Cats is similar, except that's the source material. It's a revue. There's no real story to be had. It's almost just a series of music videos.

The little story that is there amounts to a cat being dumped in an alley in London and meeting a weird society of cats on the Jelical night where one gets chosen to be sent into the sky and reborn into a new life. The main character, Victoria, wanders through the society, listening to each one sing about themselves before moving on to the next. In the midst of this is Macavity, a bad cat that is trying to cheat his way into being chosen (why? I dunno...these aren't characters in any real sense of the word). Eventually, he kidnaps Deuteronomy, the one who makes the choice, and Victoria has to convince the magical cat to make Deuteronomy reappear before introducing Grizabella and getting her chosen...It's nonsense. Grizabella has the number ""Memory"" that everyone remembers, but because Grizabella isn't really a character, instead just a single character trait that requires a soulful singing of a single song. I can fully see a certain segment of the population weeping bitterly at the soulful rendition, but narratively Grizabella is a non-entity, so her emotional impact is limited.

This movie should never have been made. I could imagine it working as a fully animated film with cats that look like, you know, cats (like Spielberg originally tried to do when he had a hand drawn animated division decades ago, hence Amblin being a production company on the film). The story is theatrical and bare, so having it exist in this weird middle space between CGI spectacle, theatrical reproduction, and cinema disaster does it no favors. It takes an idea that should have never made it to the big screen and completely undermines it even more. This is ""Springtime for Hitler"" made for real. A movie so bad that the tax man won't look too closely at the books. I will say, though, that Jennifer Hudson does give a soulful performance as Grizabella."
4.0,10 August 2020,"1. No discernible storyline. This is the main issue. In particular, there was no noticeable three-act structure - so it felt like they were just singing and dancing for no reason, on a loop. So irritating. It also quickly became boring.

2. Lack of clarity. For example, it was frustrating how they kept singing about ""Jellicle Cats"", but it was never made clear what that was. (Although admittedly, I turned it off halfway before finding out). I feel that more spoken dialogue could have possibly helped to alleviate this issue. And hence, I don't think that Cats is the type of show that works as a movie.

3. Visuals needed work. It quickly became apparent that they look weird (half human & half animal). And a lot of their movement looked unnatural or wrong e.g. they kinda look naked; and whenever they jumped around (which they did a lot) the cgi was always off.

To conclude...

It's a shame because some dance segments were good & there are a lot of talented people. It had potential, but it fell flat. It's not in the 'so bad it's good' category. It's just bad."

2.0,21 December 2019,The movie could have been incredible. Although I did enjoy many of the songs and dances it lacked a distinctive plot and so the motivation to enjoy just wasn't there. I'd definitely recommend it to those who are fans of the original and like musicals. If there was more dialogue and an obvious storyline it could have been a lot better.
10.0,11 January 2021,"This movie is quite humiliating for all involved. Ian McKellen, Judi Dench, Idris Elba especially, such high calibre actors reduced to absolute crap. I was surprised to see such a low rating of 2.3/10, surely it can't be that bad.... it is. There is no rhythm, storyline worth following. It reminds me of a monkey smashing symbols together at random intervals. The acting, singing, dancing and music all combine to give a feeling of cringe and absurdity. This is sure to go down as one of the worst films ever made."
6.0,20 November 2020,"I had heard that the movie version of the mega-Broadway hit musical CATS was a ""total trainwreck"" with bizarre performances and CGI that was incomplete and/or incompetently done making these CATS look more like FREAKS, so I was looking forward to a ""so bad it's good"" experience at the film. But, instead of being horrified or bemused, I felt another emotion while watching this...

BOREDOM.

I've never been a real fan of the Broadway production - I witnessed the original cast back in the early 1980's and had a follow-up viewing of the show on Broadway in the mid-to-late '90's when 2 people I know were in the cast and both times I enjoyed the music (for the most part) and the dancing was SUPERB, but I was left disappointed by the characters and the plot (or lack thereof) of this show.

And...that's the biggest problem with the film version of CATS, Director Tom Hooper (LES MISERABLES) decided to focus this film ON the characters and the performances - headlined by such stalwarts as Dame Judy Dench, Sir Ian McKellen, Idris, Elba, Ray Winstone, Jennifer Hudson, James Cordon and Rebel Wilson - and ignore the spectacle of the musical numbers and, most heinously, ignoring the dancing aspect of this musical. This approach, quite frankly, just did not work.

Now...add onto this questionable CGI (I'm being kind), a languid pace (I'm being kind) and performers who were miscast (I'm looking at you Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Ray Winstone and...if I'm being honest...Ian McKellan and Judy Dench), and don't get me started on Jason Derullo's RumTum Tugger and Taylor Swift's Bumbalurna (really?) - they were just plain awful. Derullo, especially, turned a fun, energizing driving character into a boring embodiment of all that is wrong with this film (okay...Rebel Wilson was worse, but still....) the only players in this film that kept my attention were stage performers like Robbie Fairchild (Munkustrap) and Francesca Hayward (Victoria) and they were sidelined for the most part by the bigger names and had their dance numbers eliminated and/or truncated.

I wish they would have gone for the campy ""so bad, it's good"" style of filmmaking - it, at least, would have kept my interest, but the movie as it is, did not. I was happy when the ""Jellicle Cat"" was selected at the end - I knew this experience would be over soon.

All of our cats have individual personalities with names mostly derived from historic British sources.

Great costuming; good CGI (wiggly ears/tail); exceptional range of dance skills (great choreography). Nuances such as the building neon signs, ""Pipurr"", ""Milk Bar"". Song lyrics, despite the catty restrictions, were creative. Characters accurately displayed a blend of human & cat behaviors.

I don't have to do that again but instead I want to point out that this movie makes me think of what the word bad really means. Sure this is bad, but it's also something else. I get the same feeling from watching this as I get from watching Troll 2 and Birdemic: this has been created by a twisted mind. It's not bad in the traditional way but bad in the sense of a piece of filth created by someone not mentally well.

Another thing that strike me is that the awful cats look like demons out of a crappy c-movie. They just look and move like shadows in the background of horror movies. Once you see that you can't stop thinking about it. Its very disturbing.

From time to time the stupidity and awfulness in this movies makes you almost hypnotized. In some bizarre way it makes you feel numb and in chock, unable to move out of your chair to switch it off.

This is not something to watch for people who are not used to very, very, very bad movies. It's a film that could make you permantly damaged if you are a person that use to see normal and decent movies.

(Do not do what one person did: take a bunch of mushrooms, see the movie, and have a really bad experience. I suspect they would have gotten the same reaction seeing ""The Wizard of Oz"" in that condition.)

The biggest complaint about it is ""OMG, cats with human faces, that's weird!"" Now admittedly, I have spent a lot of time in places where people wear cat ears and tails. But I found the effect more ""realistic"", if I can stretch the word that far, than the traditional people in cat suits and cat makeup.

So what are some of the other criticisms I've read? And I'll forewarn you, I think most of them are bogus.

""OMG, they changed the beloved choreography!"" Yeah, they did. They were freed from the boundaries of a physical stage, so they could expand dance numbers beyond its limitations. And of course, with CGI there really aren't any limitations.

""OMG, they added a new musical number!"" Yeah, they did that too. So what? Do some research on the history of musicals. Productions change with the time, the location, and the medium. Songs and dances get dropped, new songs and dances get added. When ""Show Boat"" was revived on Broadway about 10 years ago, they looked back and picked all the best numbers from previous productions.

""OMG, there's no real story, it's just a bunch of disconnected songs."" Have you read the book? Have you seen it on stage? That's what it is... cats telling their stories.

""OMG, they added some dialog and some bits about Macavity!"" Are you the same one who was just complaining that there was no plot? Some people are never satisfied.

""OMG, they had scenes with the cats in a house and they were cat-sized!"" Did you think the previous productions were about giant human-sized cats? Remember the part above about what can be done with CGI? They could put cats in a house, so they did, and they did something completely insane and made them cat-sized.

""OMG, they -"" Give it a break already! You people torpedoed a really good movie with your baseless complaints.

Now back to The Big Problem. Is the CGI perfect? No, because they rushed production so they could get the movie out in time to qualify for the Oscars. Is it a good movie? I think so. I think it's a great musical, and it's an incredible technical accomplishment.

I hope they take the time to do a final cut and clean up any CGI problems. I hope with time people realize what a good movie it really is so that it can take its place with the other great movie adaptations of stage musicals."

6.0,26 January 2022,"Cats (2019)-

Never mind ""Memory"", I'd rather forget it.

I didn't really rate the story when I appeared in an am-dram performance of Cats on stage and this film has done little to improve upon that opinion. I didn't have high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. I've always thought that it was an odd choice to take a selection of T. S. Eliot poems and turn them in to a musical in the first place and it really is quite dated, especially the musical score and composition, which should definitely have been improved upon. Some of the songs are positively bizarre.

And all of that is before it was made in to this abomination of a film.

What I did like was the clarity that was added to the story. If I hadn't been told the narrative before I performed in it, I would have had no clue what was going on, but in this case, they have added a couple of lines here and there to make it clearer and emphasised things within the songs to explain what each cat was trying to say, which made the story more understandable. It's just disappointing that it made no difference.

Personally I thought that the actors from the stage did the better job delivering the characters, which is only to be expected, as they have been doing it longer, but I was really unimpressed by Rebel Wilson and ""JAY-SON DA-RULO!"". She obviously couldn't be bothered to learn the tap dance for her character and his diction was terrible, although he wasn't the only one.

Mister Mistoffelees was actually quite adorably portrayed by the stage actor, Laurie Davidson and I liked what they did with his character and personality.

I also appreciated the use of Victoria to tie it all together, although I don't think that her additional song was necessary and it jarred with the rest of the score.

Even Taylor Swift and Idris Elba gave very basic performances, it wasn't worth paying for their star status.

Ian McKellen, of course, was superb and a shining light in this otherwise awful production. It was as if he had been born to play the part. If the rest of the film had been like that, they might have been on to a winner.

I was however highly disappointed with my main Dame Judi. She is such a superb actor and yet terribly miscast in her role of Deuteronomy.

One can only imagine how embarrassed these two amazing actors are to be associated with such poop since it's release.

Jennifer Hudson was nowhere near as good as the Grizabella in our amateur production and it was the first time a tear didn't come to my eyes when hearing the song Memory. Ever!

I'm also not sure why Ray Winstone was cast to be Growltiger? Was his part cut down or was it supposed to be that short? He could have been good if he'd had the chance to sing Billy McCaw. The Pirate's song was actually one of the more interesting in the show and yet they seemed to have only used a very small sample from it. Another waste of a talented actor.

James Corden was a surprise for me though, I have lately found it annoying to see his smug face everywhere and yet cast in the role of Bustopher Jones, he pulled it off well and the few one liners that he and Rebel exchanged added a touch of humour that was needed. I'm not sure the character suits his Weight Watchers goals though.

The CGI was terrible, as if they had loaded all of their faces in to the ""Elf Yourself"" app and because of that and the awful editing the dances were blurry and ruined. I don't understand why they didn't just wear costumes like they do on stage, perhaps more realistic ones though. They rely too much on computers when making films today and, certainly in this case, it's really not necessary.

In general the photography and editing was bad and it's hard to believe that this film was made by the same man that brought us 'Les Miserables' (2012).

Even the musical episode of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' was superior to this travesty.

On a positive note, I did like the signage with names that were appropriate to cats and the background and props were quite fun if a tad 'Borrowers'.

I also had to laugh that the film has a severe rating for Sex and Nudity on IMDB. I mean I realise that the cats aren't wearing many clothes, but I don't think that really counts.

They took something bad and made it worse.

249.55/1000."
1.0,25 March 2021,"Having finally gotten round to watching this, I'm a bit disappointed. I was expecting a horror show and hilarity, but in the end it's really... just Cats.

Ok, the cgi is a bit weird at first, but really not THAT bad after ten minutes or so. I wonder if the people rating this so low are really just realising that Cats is simply not a very interesting musical. It's a series of song and dance routines based on a collection of poems with only the merest hint of a plot holding it together. This sort of thing goes down better in a theatre because the live nature covers up some of the cracks, but those same cracks are highlighted by a movie: Cats is simply a bit dull with a handful of decent songs a d always has been.

My only real criticism of the film is the decision to change Old Deuteronomy from a male to female character. You can't do that without affecting the songs (s)he sings and I didn't think they sounded right in a female voice, the words just didn't carry the weight of a bass voice."
2.0,23 July 2024,"I watched this with 3 other people. 3 out of 4 ended up sobbing. This is a monstrosity of a film.

Whoever worked on character design should be tortured in the form of watching Cats (2019) over and over again.

The songs could not be differentiated from each other. I could literally not follow the plot because the songs were so incredibly boring. How do you manage to mess up the most important part of a musical.

None of us were rooting for the main character or the love interests. They're all bland and add nothing to the plot. They made the main character so incredibly plain that I cannot remember her name, and I mean that sincerely. Near the end of the movie, I even asked who the white cat was because I forgot she was the main character.

I would like to reiterate my hatred for the character design and acting. Me and my friends physically recoiled during some of the interactions between characters because they were so unsettling. The way they tried to recreate feline behaviors made me feel nauseous. For a moment I seriously wondered if I was tripping balls.

In conclusion, I would rather be thrown into a pit of feral cats than ever lay my eyes on this film again."
2.0,21 December 2019,My new favorite musical. Excellent choreography. Excellent singing. Beautiful actors and acting.
5.0,18 March 2020,"Oddly enough, I went in expecting to hate this film and myself for even bothering to watch this film. I came out on the other side angry at the mob mentality that has destroyed this films reputation.

First of all, the bad. Yes the CG at times can be a bit discomforting but not with the Cats (mostly) just the weird cockroaches and mice. Otherwise the film creates a very interesting feel with the human/cat look.

Next is the changes from the Stage to the film. Not at all bad. Though sometimes you may forget, you are watching a film and not a stage performance. Changes had to be made and the ones that were made did not harm the story in any way.

Finally the main point here. The music and performances were great. The people who are lambasting the choreography and singing ability of these actors are obviously not watching the same movie I am. The music is great. The choreography is fantastic. Get over it.

Mob mentality rules in modern culture and because of that we may not get to see something quite as interesting as this again. So to all of you who half way payed attention to this film because of the way it looks, go home."
1.0,3 July 2020,"What can I say about Cats that hasn't already been said countless times. It feels like a demented fever dream riddled with creepy, human-like cats that sing for 2 hrs straight. Yes, there's no normal dialogue since it's a basic musical propped up by a major Hollywood budget. The actors in this seem tired and clearly are phoning it in for a paycheck. There's no plot, just annoying singing about each cat's surface level character trait. Don't bother watching this movie unless you're on a long roadtrip in the car with a friend like I did."
2.0,3 August 2023,"Bro what, I did not understand one thing that was going on throughout this entire movie. Just cause you have big stars in a movie doesn't mean that it will be good. This is a perfectly amazing example of it. Taylor Swift's 4 minute song was the only reason I watched it and I want that time back. Also I was so confused, were they human sized cats doing this or were they cat sized cats doing stuff but standing upright like humans??? I honestly have no clue at all. Taylor, I love you so much but what was this. She probably saw the ""Cats"" and hopped right on board without looking at a script (I love cats so much so I would have probably done the same). If you want to do anything at all like fold some dishes, walk your fish, teach Cleopatra how to play video games, do that first before you watch this movie. Love you though Taylor."
2.0,28 May 2020,"'Cats' by Andrew Lloyd Webber isn't my favorite musical because, while it is visually brilliant and beautifully sung, the story is very light and minimal and the style is very dated. Nevertheless, the show was the longest-running musical from the early 1980's until the late 90's and started the long trend of family-friendly mega-blockbusters on Broadway. Based on a collection of poems by T.S. Eliot, 'Cats' the musical introduces one Jellicle cat, it sings a dynamic number and gets cast aside among the ensemble, rinse and repeat, like fashion models on the runway. As for Cats the movie, Tom Hooper gives an already incoherent narrative a plot so the movie would seem real to the cinematic eye. Victoria the White Cat (Francesca Hayward), who has no dialogue and one dance number in the show, is the main character who goes through a journey, I guess, but barely does anything to earn her Jellicle trophy. Macavity (Idris Elba) has more screen time than the episodic show as the antagonist who kidnaps other Jellicle cats: Asparagus (Ian McKellan), Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), Bustopher Jones (James Corden), and Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench). Lastly, Hooper feeds the script with terrible cat puns on par with the ones from Catwoman and suggests an even worse adlib job from Corden and Wilson. The only redeeming value in Cats the movie is the song soundtrack, performed by giants like Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift. Even ballerina Miss Hayward produces a beautiful innocent voice in her feature debut to incorporate with her dancing talents. Beyond that, I'll forgive the hideous humanoid cat special effects, but with the story mixed into an already plotless musical, Cats was a complete mess. (1 ½ Scary CGI Jellicles out of 5)"
1.0,4 April 2022,"No, this is not a positive review. The movie is painful to watch, but I can forget it easily enough. It's not as psychologically damaging as, say, Pink Flamingos (seriously, don't watch it...there are some things you can't unsee). Cats is just a horrible attempt at a musical. I couldn't make it through ten minutes before I sensed my brain cells were commiting suicide at an alarming rate and I had to turn it off. Watch it on a dare, but only if there's money involved."
10.0,26 October 2020,"Kitty Litter. I don't mean the quality Name-Brand Kitty Litter that does a good job of absorbing odors. I mean the cheap, off-brand Kitty Litter. The kind that you buy to save a dollar or two then regret because it allows the smell to permeate your house."
7.0,31 May 2021,"My synopsis - the cats are weird and the milk bar needs to shut down so they stop breeding.

1.0,7 June 2020,"When this film was so critically lambasted, disparaged and pulled apart last year, I knew I had to see it, where as I otherwise wouldn't have. It's logical. The more the critics and public at large denounce a vehicle, the more you are intrigued to see for yourself. Free promotion in advance. Of course the movie isn't anywhere near as bad as has been proclaimed.I am by no means an adequate judge and never having been a theatre goer as it stands. I enjoyed it and don't feel a bit guilty about it to boot. It was exuberant, connective, entertaining and good-natured. I never saw Cats in its theatrical incarnation, I was merely made aware of its gigantic presence and the phenomenon as the years rolled by and by. I dont think it was a particularly intricate or groundbreaking invention, more so I think it just struck a note with everyone and obviously had it's own brand of feline originality. The stage production must however, have been something of amazingly brilliant proportions, if the film adaptation I just saw shamed it so badly. A musical is something that has the ability to carry you away for a time, to muster one's stale imagination with the whimsy of song and dance and escapism.Its not Godard or Bresson or Eisenstein for God's sake, just let it be what it set out to be, a musical. In my humble opinion I had no qualms with the CGI, the costumes, the performances, the settings or anything else but then again I loved and was enraptured when I saw Lucille Ball in 'Mame' some odd 44 years ago. Maybe I just appreciate the effort, the craft and the love that went and goes into the making of one of the medium's trickiest genres. 'Godspell' ,'Darling Lili', 'Dr Doolittle' - keep bringing them, even up against the tirade of ignorant, narcissistic public and critical perception. The show must go on."

7.0,30 April 2022,"Yes, atrocious on many levels. But, consider the material. The musical ""Cats"" is a sad disaster of a musical, which became insanely popular, albeit amongst the tourists.

I would have loved it if they lost all the costumes, and ALL THE GGI crap, for crap's sake! Just let the actors play the parts as themselves. No costumes. Just let us imagine! Maybe some dancing by those that can dance.

There were a few really good performances in this. Laurie Davidson was sweet and easy to believe, even in a ridiculous part.

Ian and Judi were great in Ian's stage piece. She should have refused to do all he BS toward the end, but ah, well. . .

Robbie Fairchild made any scene he was in worth watching. Great nuanced singing, giving us great line in the music. Easy to like and believe. Hope he has a great career!"
1.0,5 June 2020,"The movie is bad, period. I gave two stars out of 10 because I actually appreciated locations and the cinematography was actually pretty decent. CGI is awful, which is inexplicable, considering the 95 million dollars budget. How can you obtain such horrible result?

Cast is composed by some of the most important actors that defined the modern cinema era such as Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, and famous singers like Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo. Even with these premises Universal still managed to hit the rock bottom. It seems like that they did it on purpose, there is no other valid explanation. I have to admit that I never watched the original play on theater, so I approached this movie having no idea what the original story is about, but in the end I could not understand the plot,because it is so confusing. You are wondering what is happening on screen. I had to go to Wikipedia and read the plot, this is the first time that something like this happens to me. And I have watched many movies through years.

Nothing can save this film, absolutely NOTHING, I am sorry for such a talented cast, completely waste their potential in a film like this, actors that made the history of cinema, involved in this... thing."
1.0,13 April 2020,"No matter how bad the evaluation is, it is famous. I want to see how ugly it is, too. After watching it, I have to say, don't look at this as a movie, just listen to the music, all right. The biggest gimmick has become the most hasty passer-by in the film. It is hard to say that it has no intention, but the film is really not so good."
3.0,18 October 2020,"Let's face it, not everybody likes Cats the musical. And I understand that Cats fans were expecting it to be an exact replica of the of the play.

5.0,5 January 2020,Really don't understand why this film has such bad reviews. Have just been to an afternoon screening and thoroughly enjoyed it. Have seen the show so don't know if that makes a difference. But definitely worse ways to spend a couple of hours on a winter afternoon
4.0,7 May 2020,"I like modern version only if they are able to achieve something better or different twist. what I do not like is special effect especially when you can see it is so fake compare of what you can do nowadays with special effects. The movie is like whole thing is fake only the faces are real (hopefully). also the sizing of the cat size and not match (cats are way too small). The acting is good but that is it most of it, could be more catchy, make it real Hollywood or stick it more with the authenticity. Missing so much in this movie even the singing is not that good. Pitty could be so much more..."
2.0,20 November 2020,"I was in CATS and what we did was use our dancing and acting skills to take an audience on a journey. The combination of amazing choreography, make up and costume made it feel real. No CGI, No Ears that moved, No robotic tails, no weird body posture. The show ran for 7,485 performances. Why did they think they needed to change it? A show that ran for 18 years on Broadway does not need much of a rewrite or a reimagining. The audiences knew we were not Cats we were actors portraying Cats this movie has morphed your worst nightmare of a Stephen King Cat into an overdone mess. This movie should come with a warning ""You will never get this 110 minutes of your life back""."

1.0,7 January 2020,"I've read lots of reviews of people saying that this is such a bad movie, but that's not true! Don't believe it. I'm happy I ignored them and went to see it for myself to decide..

It was such a joy!! Throughout the whole film I was smiling. I never liked the stage version and I'm a huge musical freak, so I had no idea what to expect and had my doubts about going to see this one. I now finally understand the story, thanks to this movie, and appreciate the music much more!!! The colors and sets were breathtaking, the music sounded like heaven, and the actors were brilliant. Love that they casted new actors too. The CGI really wasn't bad. People need to stop complaining and realize that these cats are magical cats. They aren't the cats we keep as pets. They are 'Jellicle Cats' and do not have to look like regular cats. Have people lost their imagination?? They didn't frighten me at all, as some people said. Amazing what they can do nowadays, especially with the fur and cat ears. Don't go watch it if Musicals aren't your thing. This is a 'Musical, Musical'.

Conclusion, just go see it for yourself. Everyone has its own taste. It's obviously fine if you don't like it, but this movie certainly doesn't deserve so many bad reviews and money loss. I've seen far worse movies than this. I suggest before seeing it, to look for the story online and use your imagination while watching it ;) Enjoy this beautiful dream!"
4.0,2 January 2020,"This movie is not nearly as bad as the reviews claim. The performances, especially not the ""big"" names are really good-smart move to cast actual dancers. Jennifer Hudson nails Memory. James Corden and Rebel Wilson provide welcome comic relief. Jason DeRulo can sing and dance. Wasn't thrilled with the look of Iris Elba as Macavity- he seemed too thin and the eyes were distracting. The dance sequences are well done and if anything, the movie emphasizes an actual storyline. My criticism lies with the direction and the CGI- they don't look like cats. The stage production had better makeup and costumes. They also moved more like cats in the stage production. The movie just doesn't capture the magic of the stage production."
1.0,6 December 2020,"Ok for full disclosure, so even though I enjoy some of the music I am not a fan of cats. I was very curious about the movie with an amazing cast including Judi Dench, Taylor swift, rebel Wilson, Ian McClellan, janes cordon qand especially Idris Elba. Unfortunately I found it boring and almost unwatchable. It was super creepy and bizarre. The CGI was at best weird and at worst deeply disturbing . The vocals were decent but frankly not as good as you'd expect from the likes of the star studded cast. I did not enjoy it overall overall."
2.0,28 January 2024,"The musical ""Cats"" is a remarkable and immersive journey into a magical world filled with captivating music, stunning choreography, and beautiful costumes. The story of the Jellicles and their yearly ceremony to ascend to the Heaviside Layer is truly enchanting, and the decision-making process involves careful consideration of each cat's character, personality, and deeds. As a lover of theater, I highly recommend ""Cats"" to anyone seeking uplifting entertainment. The musical's opening number sets the tone for the rest of the show, taking the audience on an emotional roller coaster that leaves them feeling inspired and uplifted. The movie adaptation is visually stunning, with an all-star cast bringing the story to life in a way that is both captivating and heartwarming. Overall, ""Cats"" is a one-of-a-kind experience that I believe will enrich anyone's love for the theater."

Songs, story, setting, cgi, acting, script, plot, makeup, camerawork, costumes etc. Its absolutely tasteless.

This is a truly weird version, and a lot of the cast have blatantly been included just for their name (and younger audience appeal) than their actual talent.

Use your time more wisely ... just watch the 1998 filmed stage version with Elaine Paige and John Partridge."

3.0,31 May 2021,"Cats (2019) is a film that's been poorly received since it came out, and I thought I should watch it because it might be ""so bad it's good"". Let's start off with the positives. Onto the negatives, the cinematography here is just headache inducing. Basically for the very small moments in between the music performances the cinematography switches to this extremely shaky handheld camera and like maybe they were going for the perspective of the cats but it just comes off as completely unnecessary. The CGI here is just awful, and these human cat hybrids taking up most of the screen just make things worse. To be honest, the movie could have some style with the use of color and some of the cinematography if it wasn't for the fact the subjects of the frame were these ""cats"" that did not blend in very well with their background. Moving on to the plots and characters... man there's really not much to talk about. This film just had so very little plot for an almost 2 hour runtime. There are these extremely long musical scenes that 99% of the time actually do nothing at all to advance the plot and then there are literally 2 minutes in between where all the cats do the weird crawling thing and our protagonist moves to a new area. Speaking of the protagonist, we basically know nothing at all about her until halfway through the film. The characters are all almost nonexistent, and I could've cared less if they were all killed by the exterminator. I was just so bored throughout the film because I cared about nothing that was happening, and even if I did the musical parts drag on for way too long and would basically ruin the whole thing anyway.

Don't let the fact Cats has so little plot make you think ""oh so it's something artsy"". Artsy films like 2001 have a lot of possible themes that you can project onto them, and the plot there is clearly goes deeper into your subconscious to create a thoughtful experience. Cats does not do this. Cats has no themes besides don't abuse your animals. Besides, at least with films like 2001 and Blade Runner everything is done really well, in Cats nothing is done that well.

I guess the music is fine but this film is almost entirely song and dance. The only thing that made this slightly tolerable was my brother sitting next to me laughing and making fun of the movie, but after he ditched me to go on the computer I was just disappointed. I can't think of any intentional comedy that lands. I won't bother getting into the whole thing about the fact our main character literally just arrived and somehow magically knew the moves for all the very complex and intricate dances. Overall, Cats had... a little going for it? Not really, the potential for good style doesn't matter because it was all ruined anyway. Cats gets a 1/10."
9.0,6 April 2020,"In my opinion, this movie was a disaster. A hugely successful and popular Broadway musical that didn't translate well into a movie musical.

I was bored. so I decided to watch this movie despite the low reviews in IMDB. Sure enough, majority rules. This movie is terrible.

It took me a while to finish the entire movie, as I frequently stopped watching it due to boredom. But eventually, after a few days I did finish it. But sadly it didn't improve my thoughts on the movie. But it gave me a good laugh. Not because the movie was funny, rather I laughed at how silly it was.

I have to admire the person who pitched the idea to the studio execs and got it approved for production. Then convinced all the A-Grade actors, singers, & artists to join the cast for the movie. This person is one heck of a sales person.

So unless you're a huge fan, and I mean a HUGE fan of the Broadway musical, there are better ways to waste 110 minutes of your life. Like watch clouds float across the sky."
7.0,9 November 2021,"Nothing like the London musical version from years ago. They could have make better casting choices, if they wanted me to take this seriously.

The special effects ruined it partially. But some of the cast just can't sing, especially musical numbers."

1.0,20 December 2019,Francesca Hayward's 'Victoria' takes centre stage in this remarkable portrayal of the original West End production of Cats. The score compliments the original 'Webber' magic and stays true to the stage show. Judy Dench's portrayal of 'Old Deuteronomy' worked incredibly well considering the original was a male role whilst Jennifer Hudson's 'Grizabella' doesn't fail to give you goosebumps at the end of the film. Rebel Wilson ( Jennyanydots ) and James Corden ( Bustopher Jones ) seemed to play themselves very well and a nice little touch from Ray Winstone ( Growltiger ) gets typecast and the cap fits very well. A very well made sentiment to the original stage show that those who have seen the West End show will understand totally. If you have never seen or heard the score then the film might not sit well with the viewer. Anthropomorphism at its absolute finest. I loved it

2.0,5 August 2020,"I couldn't even watch 2 minutes of this movie, & I can't take back the time i let my eyes burn looking at the worst movie ever made!!"
5.0,3 February 2020,"I'm probably going to say something that has been already said, the original Andrew Lloyd Webber musical CATS is very flawed. I for example see it more as an interpretive ballet rather than a real musical like Sweeney Todd or Wicked. There was room for improvement and any filmmaker could've used the source material as a foundation for a much better musical movie. But that's not what happened.

As far as I can tell, Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't have any type of producer credit on this film. But man... the lack of adaptation has his fingerprints all over it. This film is just the stage show on a movie set with big name actors. It's the same issue that plagued the Phantom of the Opera film adaptation. Screenwriters Lee Hall and Tom Hooper didn't seem to try hard enough to make this musical work on the big screen. It seems like Webber and Director Tom Hopper seem to think that since the stage version won 7 Tony's, it will also win 7 Oscars if it's just the same musical with a few changes.

There's at least 3 or 4 songs you could cut from this movie and have it not change a thing in the film but they're kept in because... shut up. Ian McKellen for instance has this solo as Gus the Theater Cat. It seems to last an eternity even though in reality it's only 4 minutes long. Seriously, why didn't they cut this? There are two fat cats played by Rebel Wilson and James Corden but... why? Does this movie really need two overweight comic relief characters? Webber really needs to figure out what the word ""Adaptation"" means.

And yet... this is probably one of the funniest embarrassments of cinema I have ever seen in my entire life. CATS is destined to become a So Bad it's Good cult classic just life The Room, From Justin To Kelly, Mommie Dearest and yes... Showgirls. The bad English accents coming from the American cast members,the crazy musical numbers and horrific dialogue are only some of the most hilarious things you'll find in this hairball of a film."
1.0,15 April 2020,I went to see the play and loved it them I watch movie and ended up fast forwarding through it. It was so bad that I wished I had rented Trolls World Tour instead. Rating a one star is being generous and because Idris Elba is one of my favs.
1.0,18 November 2020,"?tune into the last 15 minutes to hear Jennifer Hudson sing ""Memory"". It is an exquisite song (God only knows what it's doing in this movie?). But it is a beautiful heartfelt song. Just skip them rest of the film, it's filler. Judy Dench is lovely, Ian mcmellan is wwasted. That girl singer, Swift something is there for one song, and obviously has never seen a cat in person before. Just wasted air space. The Broadway musical was definitely better, but the audience was somewhat involved. Kept you watching. Still one of Lloyd Webbers worst nusicals. Save your money, not worth $1.00."
10.0,9 December 2021,In the lead up to Halloween I wanted something really frightful. Something that would haunt my dreams for weeks to come. Found it. Regretted it. Now the songs and Rebel Wilson will forever be in my head. I love musicals but this was just a big fat hairball needing to be coughed out.
6.0,3 December 2020,"This movie made me... uneasy.

The character design is awful. The human faces on unrealistic cat bodies with CGI fur is deeply unnerving to the point where I wanted to look away. The way the cats move looks awkward and almost creepy, because they don't look like cats nor hold their bodies as a cat would, but they attempt to interact with the environment like a cat. It's a confused mess visually, even beyond the design of the characters. The scale is bizarre. Sometimes the cats are the size of a small child and sometimes they're five inches tall. I didn't like the visual effects or sets or basically anything else about it. The long dancing sequences were boring and looked bad. Also, the mice and roaches were unbearable to even look at.

Almost every character is absolutely insufferable. I thoroughly disliked the entire main cast and I hated how some of the cats were portrayed, especially Jennyanydots and Bustopher Jones. A lot of the performances lacked the necessary energy to make them enjoyable. Comparing it to the musical version makes the movie seem so.... dull. Despite the comedy factor of the creepy design, this is a boring movie. I actually fast-forwarded through parts of it because I was so uninterested. None of the jokes are funny and the dialogue is kind of baffling.

Finally, the songs sound bad. This is a major sin for a musical movie. The singing performances are poor, which is unfortunate because there are a lot of talented people involved. I thought most of their voices didn't fit the songs they were given and most were hard to listen to. The sound mixing is awful and literally every single song sounds much worse than in the stage version. It feels rushed and probably never should have been made, to be honest.

Giving it a 2/10 because I suppose it could be worse."
3.0,6 December 2020,"I don't normally write reviews but I feel I need to write one now, for posterity - perhaps as a warning to future generations. This....'film'....should be avoided at all costs. I watched it with my wife and children and the four of us spent the first five minutes shouting, 'Oh my God! WHAT!?' before the children started looking at their phones to distract them from the hideous mess that was assaulting our eyeballs. I, dear reader, persevered, despite every fiber of my body telling me otherwise. I only gave this a rating of two because there were brief elements of so-bad-it's-good (ripping the heads off tapdancing cockroaches with human heads, was one shining example). This film made no sense whatsoever and if I hear the word 'jellicle' ever again, extreme violence will ensue."
1.0,28 December 2019,Seen reviews of people who probably didn't watched the trailers. This is a movie of Cats played by actors in costumes same as the stageshow. If you like dance and singing as in the musical you will love the show. And if you are afraid of seeing Cats with human faces just watch the trailer first and decide for yourself.
4.0,11 February 2020,"I watched this movie with my partner and we both quite enjoyed it. My partner had never seen the stage adaption but I have and I thought they did a really good job with what they had.

I honestly don't get the negative reviews but if you dissect them closely you will see that the majority of negative reviewers have either A. Never seen cats the stage adaption B. Don't like the costumes C. Claim there is no plot (which suggests they haven't seen the stage adaption) or D. Explain nothing of what they disliked again suggesting they either haven't seen the stage adaption or are just highly confused individuals that find it hard to comprehend that a musical movie about cats will include dancing and singing cats.

Now I'll admit this movie could have been a lot better. I didn't care that much for one of the new added musical numbers and was slightly disappointed by Jason Derulos' performance as Rum Tum Tugger, who I felt missed a lot of that oomph and va va voom the original Tugger had. His vocals were fine but lacked sass and depth. I did enjoy his rendition but feel that the character of Rum Tum Tugger is so central in the original that I wanted to feel that connection to the character and I just didn't get his cheekiness and arrogance as I did with the stage show and nor did he play as much as a part in the movie as I'd have liked but still a good attempt from Jason whom I usually love.

Jennifer Hudson is outstanding as always and sings all her parts with emotion and poise.

Judy Dench did well as the gentle Deuteronomy and I loved Victoria as we see a lot more of her and learn of her background which brings the story alive in a way that you don't get to see on stage.

James Corden was terrific but his number could have been edited slightly. Comic gold but just dragged ever so slightly.

I personally preferred the choreographed routines from the stage adaption as I felt the lack of within the movie meant that sometimes, dance scenes looked a bit less polished and chaotic but I get they did the best with what they had.

They left a song out that I feel should have stayed in and replaced the new unnecessary Thames song. That was lost on me.

Idris Elba as Macavity was menacing and creepy but if i'm honest I don't feel they made him creepy enough. It started off well but then towards they end he looses that IT factor but that was due to the script.

Mr Mistoffelees was very good and quite a central character and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Victoria however his main musical number lacked mystery and I didn't like that he sang his own song unlike in the stage adaption but that is just me.

I loved the visuals and graphics, especially at the beginning. If you've seen this on stage, you'll know what I mean. I finally got what the whole cat in bag thing was all about thanks to the movie and it was nice having a tangible backstory which helped in understanding Victoria and her introduction the cats as well Grizabella etc.

Overall this was an enjoyable movie for anyone who doesn't take life too seriously, likes a bit of humour and nostalgia and has seen cats the stage musical. If you haven't seen this on stage then you're unlikely to truly 'get it' though can still enjoy the watch if you have an open mind and are fond of unusual and beautiful art. That is all this movie is. It's art, nothing more nothing less and it isn't trying to be what it isn't but rather just adapting from stage to screen which isn't always easy.

So guys cut some slack where it's due and get your jellicle on.. or not... those of us with a sense of humour will still be singing along with it ;)"

3.0,14 August 2020,"I'm currently in the hospital and decided to watch a free movie. Big mistake. Pretty sure this movie took years off my lifespan. Never seen anything so awful and I seek bad films. Almost asked for a cyanide pill wheh I couldn't reach the remote. On a serious note, with that budget my dog could have genetically engineered singing and dancing cats more entertaining. The songs were soul crushing. How many times can you fit Jellicle in a freaking minute? I was looking so hard for a plot I think I just imagined my own. Why close up on terrible CGI.? Why?? They all look like they put their heads in a slice of bread, shrieked their lines then created the CGI and set AROUND IT - with the worst resources ever. The main cat had this dumb bewildered look on her face the whole time I wanted to smack off like...get a clue. Vocal talent was where? If anyone wants to join me for a Class Action against this film let me know. I'll be sending them my medical bill."
5.0,2 April 2020,"I have seen the theatre production of Cats and can say it was fantastic.

This adaptation however falls far short.

I was expecting what I saw and heard in the theatre, a well put together cast who could act and SING in TUNE.

I didn't get that at ALL. What I got was ONE singer, TWO True Actors and a bunch who couldn't act/sing even if you sent them to Julie Andrews for training.

Thank you Jennifer Hudson, Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen for doing what you could with this mediocre script.

This movie was an insult to all lovers of the theatre production.

The Director needs to learn to stop altering scrpits of theatre productions and actually keep to it 100% with ZERO changes."
1.0,23 March 2020,"Cats wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. The songs were catchy, the visuals weren't awful ... it was weird, fun and silly.

8.0,16 February 2021,"I like the songs & music from Cats, don't get me wrong, but the Film is not really my cup of tea & the effects were ugly. No wonder Cats hardly won any Awards. No BAFTAs, no Oscars, not even a Golden Globe."

2.0,18 July 2020,"Terrible movie. Truly. So why did I give it 4 stars? Well, I can't exactly pin down why it was horrible. The movie did have a few impressive aspects like the star, and, of course Taylor Swift was right on par... the movie actually had a lot of talent. It had some good choreography... of course, a couple good songs, well sung. These various aspects just didn't meld, I think. What could of been brilliant ended up feeling like sitting in a waiting room for the dentist... it just dragged on and on, and I just could wait for the whole ""trip"" to be over; sore gums and all."
1.0,27 December 2019,"A beautiful production of the show. Through the magic of movie making the story behind the musical was made much more poignant and clear. The characters were more lovable as we experienced their expressions so much more clearly than on stage. I have to give special praise to the portrayals of Grizabella, Mr. Mistopholes, Gus, and Victoria who brought joy, tears, and inspiration to the audience. It's been sad to hear of the poor reviews others have given (many without even having seen it) and I can only imagine that they expected this to be something other than the musical which it is. I hope those that read this will go see it with an open mind and an expectation to see a film rendition of a treasured Broadway and London West End musical."
1.0,25 December 2019,"Ok as an avid lover of the musical and watcher of the VHS London cast throughout my childhood I was ecstatic when I heard it was being made into a feature film! Then I saw the trailer and like everyone else my dreams were crushed. Next the reviews rolled in for the movie by critics and viewers and 2.6 out of 10 stars speaks for itself. I prepared for the absolute worst.

And here's the thing...did it miss the mark by a landslide? Absolutely. Are there a million ways it failed to fulfill an iota of it's maximum potential? 100%. But when all is said and done, I sat in that theater with the right crew of people who were willing to go along with the ride, and...I really REALLY enjoyed it! I just took it for what it was and was able to forgive the shortcomings in favor of experiencing the magic of a new envisioning of characters whom i have loved for decades!

So my advice: if you love the musical and can muster a whimsical ""to heck with expectations"" attitude, see this music on the big screen and just enjoy the ride! It really did leave so much to be desired...but to heck with that! I enjoyed it anyway!"
1.0,30 January 2020,"So Cats... Well its based off the neatly 40 yr old musical of huge success which was based on a book of poems about cats by T.S.Eliot.

The songs and story are similar to the show with the odd change. The stage show follows a 50s jazz theme with balads inbetween.

I guess the problem here is for a modern cinematic production it is a little bit dated, They could have updated the score a little whole keeping the lyrics and the familiriaty with the poems.

The dance numbers were quite bland and static , almost solo pieces rather than great musical ensembles.

Visually the CGI cats were fine, maybe strange but similar to the stage show, The backdrops were bland mainly blurry and everything had this sickly pink tinge to it regardless of night day or lighting.

The story, as is the stage show quite bland yet somehow it gets more bland, more meandering and less interesting here, on top of that the performances seem vague and distant and there is little character connection or actor connection ( did everyone perform solo on green screen ?? )

So while this wasn't a great adaptation it wasn't totally awful...... IF you enjoy musicals or a fan of Cats. ( Not Dogs )

If your not a musical fan then I can't see there being enough within this film to peak your interests."
4.0,4 July 2021,"This movie isn't good or bad... it's pretty mixed.

Negatives include the VERY strange CGI (obviously), and a few singing issues (a lot of cast members aren't that good at singing, which is a huge negative for a theatre kid). Judi Dench completely butchers the final number. The last song is supposed to be a belted operatic performance, but instead she ""speak songs"" the entire thing.

However, for positives we have the fact that the music itself is incredible. As an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, it's sure to be good; there's a reason why the stage version is so popular. The second plus is ALW wrote a new song for this movie called ""Beautiful Ghosts"", and it's BEAUTIFUL... ALW definitely still has his amazing composing skills. And last, and definitely the biggest positive, is Jennifer Hudson. She SHINES and CARRIES this movie. Every time she sings, she steals the show. This movie is worth watching just for her performance."

6.0,25 June 2020,"I'm a theatre and dance fan, and have seen the live stage musical. Cats has always been a big show and dance about different kind of cats with a hint of a storyline about getting to the Heavyside Layer. So yeah, not really much plot so wasn't expecting that but the movie actually created a plot or two. The stage musical is not the best ever, but it's fun with great ""cat"" dance choreography and some truly great songs. Lots of comments have been made about the whole cat CGI thing, but really - it's HUMANs playing CATs! They could have probably made a whole bunch of cat CGIs dancing with just the actors voicing them if they wanted to. Have you even seen the Cats costumes on the stage musical? The movie ""costume"" is an upgraded version! I enjoyed the big song and dance numbers in the movie. You can tell that most of the cast are professional dancers and I thought all the ""lesser"" names (probably big ones on stage) did a really good job and were the highlights. I probably enjoyed them the most. Don't really like Taylor Swift's interpretation of Macavity - which annoyed me, as it's one of my favourite song in the stage musical, but it's alright. Probably better with an earthier jazzy singer. The new song is okay, nothing special like Memory. I truly hate any scenes with Rebel Wilson or James Corden. The added ""bits"" to make them ""funny"" just made me cringe. So if you delete their scenes, it's an okay movie. Probably give the stage musical a 6, and the movie a 3.5. Kudos to the dancers though."
1.0,9 April 2020,The movie is average and okay. Not that amazing. It should be more good.
1.0,24 December 2019,"This is a movie that doesn't deserve the slating it's gotten from critics. Go see it, remember it's not disney. It's not ""hollywood"" it's not American. It's British and proud. The real star is Frankie Hayward from the Royal Ballet. With Steven Macrae(Royal Ballet) Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellan, all the Americans had to up their game and Jennifer Hudson knocked it out of the park. This was a movie that had me singing the Magical Mr Mistoffelles and Memory, crying when Jennifer cried and laughing with Francesca. Ignore the critics - be a Jellicle Cat!"
3.0,22 December 2019,"I really don't understand all the hate. We all know the story is thin, and that most of the music is forgettable, but I quite enjoyed watching this movie. The make-up was Imho excellent done, the characters perfect in place, the music catchier than expected. Jennifer Hudson and James Corden were casted perfectly. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, and I also saw people leaving, but all-in-all I had a great night. So if you like musicals and want to watch something different, give this a chance,"
2.0,11 November 2020,"What actually just happened???? This could really go down in history as the worst musical adaptation ever made. I LOVE musicals and have performed in many. Cats has always been one of my favorites. This was a total embarrassment. The singing, dancing, acting, sets, camera angles, costumes, and music--all miserably bad. I was so excited to see a modern take on one of my favorites. A cartoon version would have been better. I thought Cat in the Hat would be the worst cat movie of all time. We have a new winner!! The only saving grace is that I signed on to write a review and got to read all the hilarious comments :-) This is PROOF that we all can agree no matter what race, color, age, or sexual orientation. My faith in humanity is restored!!"
2.0,30 December 2020,Not much more to add other than it's awful. Christ! Also wtf is a Jellicle cat...
5.0,6 November 2020,"I watched it for the music, dancing, and because everyone said it so horrid (including those in it). I didn't care about the CGI (which is creepy at times...wished they'd worn ballet slippers instead of bare feet). I have never seen it on stage. I saw the TV version of the stage version. It bored me to tears. This one actually kept my interest and helped me understand what the plot of the original was. Was it favorite movie, no, but I'd probably watch it again.

Jennifer Hudson was absolutely wonderful!"
1.0,18 February 2020,"The worst part of the film is when the actors/actresses cheer, instead of cheering, they meow. The meows made my ears bleed. It's horrible. The VFX are god awful. The actors are uncanny valley human - cat hybrids. When they rub each other, scratch themselves etc, I felt incredibly uncomfortable. The ears and tails constantly twitching are incredibly distracting in 'emotional' moments of the film. The backgrounds and other scenery that's more than 6 feet from any actor descends into jpeg level quality, and most of the backgrounds look like they came from a PS2 game. I didn't know scenery and props could be uncanny valley but I have now seen otherwise. If anybody asks me if I've tried LSD, I will simply reply that I have watched the Cats Movie The backdrops are full of flashy neon billboards, all of which are terrible cat puns with the exception of proudly unaltered ""B O V R I L"" The few jokes that are there are mostly slapstick. Seeing tiny cgi mouse demons scream in fear and pain as they're thrown across the room did force a small smile out of me. James Corden is James Corden. One of James Corden's lines is ""This isn't going to work, is it?"" Which seems more like he was talking to the director. Acting wasn't that bad and the plot was about as non existent as the original.

As somebody who liked the original musical, the film added little to it besides uncanny valley and took away a lot of the charm. I'd advise people to instead look to the 1998 (I think) recording of the musical. The 2019 version is that but with wacky visuals and James Corden humour."
3.0,12 March 2022,"Cat is the worst movie forever!

That time wasn't a good time for giving them my praise. Unfortunately, they couldn't save the film as well as other cast which I consider perfect as well. I'm not sure what exactly disappointed me whether it was an incoherent plot, strange lines or... how bad it was shot? I literally started feeling dizzy while watching it at the cinema and had to leave it in the middle of the show."

1.0,5 February 2021,"Look the movie on its own is terrible but if you have a good group of friends and maybe a couple of drinks, it can actually be pretty enjoyable. There are some funny moments, the songs are bangers that'll get stuck in your head and it can bring you together with how much you'll be making fun of it."
1.0,21 December 2019,This adaption makes the storyline much easier to understand. It also adds in modern humor and a possible budding relationship between Victoria and Mr Mistoffelees? The music is incredible and I would definitely watch it again.
1.0,23 December 2019,"I absolutely love this musical in the first place and the movie is just that. I can understand why some people can see it as ""cringey"" because human actors are playing literal cats and acting out what cats would do and interact as. The cgi takes a little getting used to but once you get used to it it's totally fine. Rebel Wilson is hilarious, Taylor Swift actually wasn't too bad, James Corden is a great Bustopher Jones, Jennifer Hudson is amazing, and (as a dancer myself) the dancing is great with all the talented dancers alongside Robbie Fairchild and Francesca Hayward! All the same songs even-though some changed tune or tempo and a new song (for Victoria) which was pretty good. The little extra scenes made people who don't know the musical understand the overall plot. It's a written for Broadway show turned into a movie and I think they did a pretty good job. Go see it if you love the musical!"

4.0,4 May 2020,"I won't give less than 4 stars because yes, the CGI is awful, I couldn't really follow the story, but the actors were good at acting (as much as I could see of them, anyway) and at singing. I think that this could have somehow been better if the final product just showed them singing the songs in the dotted suit and in front of a green screen."
1.0,26 December 2020,"Young cat Victoria (Hayward) is abandoned and joins the jellicle cats on the one night of the year when Deuteronomy (Dench) decides which cat will go the the heavyside layer to be reborn.

Hard to understand quite why this was so strongly lambasted by everyone on its release. Cats is a song and dance review held together by a very thin plot ie each character does a number as their nomination for getting the prize of going to the heavyside layer - that's it. It is not a typical musical and this is how it was when first launched at the theatre in London in 1981. If you want a classical 'musical' - avoid, but anyone who saw the stage show will recognise this.

However, in bringing this tightly knitted, almost claustrophobic show to the big screen, mistakes have been made. There is an attempt to try and create a story to explain what's going on and to broaden that 'story' which doesn't work plus there are some seriously bad musical numbers eg those with Rebel Wilson and James Corden plus Alba just isn't right for Macavity. Dench is lovely and has the gravitas and acting chops for Deuteronomy, but a singing voice would be nice, but both she and McKellan emerge with dignity intact.

Overall then better than everyone is saying with the most wonderful sets and some good set pieces, but not remotely near the spectacular, moving experience it should have been."
3.0,2 April 2021,"HBO is free, at the condo, we're visiting. I ADORE James Cordon (Gavin & Stacey, is the funniest show I've ever seen) & wanted to see it, just for his performance.

10.0,30 March 2020,"Cats is not actually a bad movie. It is well made and well acted. The real problem is that there is no story here. A bunch of cats running around town singing is not a story, even if one of them eventually wins a competition. Also, the CGI hid the characterization that many of the actors were bringing to their roles. The professional dancers were still able to emote using body language, and that was good. But I went into this expecting a terrible movie, and just got a boring one. That was disappointing. A lot of people clearly don't know what a bad movie really is."
6.0,5 February 2022,"I saw this the day it came out in theatres and wanted to kill myself the second the ended. I am a huge fan of the stage version and I would sell a limb to be in a production but the film was so terrible! At the time, I wanted Cats to have more recognition and this wasn't the way i wanted it to be! If you wanna make a film version of an already established thing, make a person who loves and knows the show well direct it! I'm so glad Andrew Lloyd Webber hated it! It's an abomination of a film! They miscast actors, they butchered all the songs and the whole film just lost the charm the musical had (except for Skimbleshanks) and the ones who actually enjoyed this terrible movie deserve to to bullied!"
1.0,28 May 2020,"I loved this play when it opened in London and took everyone I knew to it in New York on Broadway, as well, even though it lost a bit by not being staged in the round as it was in London.

The music and to some degree the dancing are enjoyable in this movie but the lack of costumes and stage makeup is unforgivable and unfortunately, unforgettable. The cats look more like monkeys. The heads are undersized and the tails are rarely feline. Did anyone involved in the movie ever look at a cat or a picture of a cat? Maybe even a drawing of a cat?

In the theatre every actor literally became a cat and always stayed a cat whether moving or still. They had the right sized head with ears in the right place and they had paws, four of them!

All the actors I have seen being interviewed about their performance in this movie has been suitably embarrassed. I'm not sure why they didn't all sue to have their faces digitally removed like their bodies. Please try again....maybe as a cartoon next time, couldn't be any worse."
1.0,21 December 2019,"Loved it. I also loved the musical. If you hate/don't understand the musical, this isn't going to magically change your mind. CATS is supposed to be a dance spectacle. It is what it is. It's supposed to be weird because it's about people playing cats with a very loose plot. Now the movie gives us a more complete plot without rearranging the musical, which I thought was nice for the most part. YES THE CGI CAT HAIR IS WEIRD AND IF YOU HATE IT SO MUCH SO THAT IT RUINS THE MOVIE FOR YOU DONT SEE IT. ITS WEIRD OH WELL. But after awhile you just get used to how they are ""dressed."" Overall the movie was fun and really well done. It's exactly what you expect. It's CATS the movie musical. The more you hate it, the more it gives power to the jellicle cats to go to the heavyside layer. Thank you."
4.0,4 February 2020,A great way to experience psychedelia without taking an illegal substance. The experience: 8/10 (in a bad kind of good fever dream way) The movie: 2/10.
3.0,6 January 2022,"I think this film is actually showing a cat's perspective of what it feels like when they take catnip. I certainly felt like I had taken some while watching it.

Genuinely, some of the songs are fun but a bit long, but all of the visual aspects are just horrifying. And why are all the cats so lusty? They keep making uncomfortably intimate eye contact with each other...

I was also surprised to see some people praising the dancing, as I thought it was really not good at all. In the musical, even though the type of dancing was really not my style, I could see that they were doing a good job at what they were going for. Here though, it felt quite amateurish.

That said, despite being pretty terrible, I can't say I didn't have fun watching it. There's certainly some entertainment value here, even just from the sheer weirdness of it all."
5.0,31 January 2021,"I wanted to watch this movie with an open mind knowing its reputation, but honestly. The visuals are worse than I thought. I'm afraid I might get nightmares. Please.. Make me forget!"
1.0,18 August 2023,"This is a film I have kinda been wanting to see so I finally broke down and bought the DVD; It's now scratched off my list of 'to see' films. I won't throw it in the litter box but it's not a film I'd completely watch again.

There are some great acting & singing here from Ian McKellen, Dame Judith Dench, Taylor Swift, Idris Elba and Jason Derulo - all give outstanding performances.

My real beef with the film was the story. I've never seen Cats at the theater or on DVD before and didn't know much about it really but I feel they wasted an opportunity to create an awesome story of our feline friends. The script goes in the litter box.

Anyway, I have to give stars for the actors/singers, costumes and set designs - not so much the story.

4/10."
3.0,9 May 2020,"Apart from scary human faces with whiskers over cat bodies and meaningless close ups just like in LES MIS as hooper tries to prove they sing love, what a bad orchestration it was. All the beautiful notes and playful tunes are lost to a more ""today's"" beats. Wondered if Webber were ok with that?"
4.0,14 October 2020,Full disclosure i was playing online poker while watching this. I saw the play on Broadway so i knew what i was in for. What was missing? The booming voices!

7.0,22 October 2020,"I wanted to see this, I'm not going to lie. When I heard about it forever ago I expected it to be good.. and then I saw the trailer, and it looked not great. I ended up not seeing it in the theaters but instead the other night I watched it on HBO Max for free and it was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. A fantastic cast that I continued to think to myself ""WHY would you do this movie?"", they look nothing like cats and they don't even try to act like cats. It's just all around terrible. I was not able to finish the movie. I was able to hang on to see Taylor Swift, and then we all shut it off. Horrible movie. I also want to say that the special effects and everything was just terrible. Tom Hooper did a terrible job and this movie was a disaster."
5.0,19 January 2020,"My girlfriend is a fan of the stage show and really wanted to see this film. I did not, but went with her nonetheless. I've heard numerous bad reviews and so I was bracing myself while keeping an open mind.

Guess what people? Filmmaking is an art, and films don't always fit in your narrow definition of the term. Yeah, the plot isn't as deep as an episode of Sherlock, but hey, it's a story about cats. They dared to use technology to produce something that wasn't pressed from the cookie-cutter; Good! Of course it comes across a little weird, but if you give it a chance, it'll draw you in.

Francesca Hayward is perfectly cast as the initially timid Victoria, and Jennifer Hudson, unsurprisingly, gives an emotional and powerful singing performance.

Some excellent performances. The acting is superb, the singing and dancing are wonderful, the cgi is top notch. Very imaginative and firmly rooted in a fantasised version of the world we live in.

No film is perfect, nor will it be everyone's cup of tea, but why condemn so harshly and ruin the impressions of others, and the efforts of artists working towards a unified vision? I am shocked by the seemingly endless vitriol cast onto this film. I guess I prefer cats to people in many ways; people take pleasure in being hateful."

4.0,7 April 2024,"I knew this was going to be a bad film going, and after avoiding it for over 4 years and finally watching it, I can confirm that my fears were right. This is undoubtedly one of worst movies ever made. It's also one of only a few films I've had the dishonor of giving a 1/10 rating, something I don't like doing because there aren't many films that deserve this score from me. As a film, it pretty much fails on every level. It's almost irredeemably bad and also painful to watch. The people who worked on this must have known it was going to be bad and it amazes me that this film even managed to see the light of day.

Let me break down why its one of the worst movies ever: The humanoid designs of the cats are creepy, which is the most obvious problem with this film. They all look like Mike Myers as Cat In the Hat but this time around it uses some uncanny CGI. Its not just the cats, but there are also mice and cockroaches in the film that also look just as awkward and disturbing even though they get far less screentime. This makes the film unintentionally scary. Another thing I'd like to point out is that there are basically no humans shown in the film. This isn't really a criticism but it makes the city the movie takes place in feel unbelievably empty and devoid of any life. Second, the movie has literally no plot. I couldn't figure out exactly what was going on since the cats just move from place to place and sing random songs. Speaking of which, 99% of the dialogue is singing. There's a new song every 5 minutes and none of the songs make any sense (the iconic ""Memory"" might be an exception to this). They keep mentioning Jellicle Cats throughout the film and I have no idea what it even means. Apparently, they have to perform some sort of ritual on one of their own to keep up the spirits of the cats. Yeah, everything is extremely confusing. There are also a lot of big names cast in this film like James Corden, Ian McKellen, Jason Derulo, and Jennifer Hudson. These are talented people, but their performances in this film are awful. The best appearance was the Taylor Swift cat who was only in the film for like 2 minutes, which only adds insult to injury. I don't know why any of these celebrities agreed to be part of this, maybe it was for the money. There are several attempts at humor and they just come off as gross and unfunny, like the James Corden cat farting and some jokes about fat shaming. There are also many plot holes, like how the Idris Elba cat captures the old female leader of the cats without any explanation and its unclear what happens to the Jennifer Hudson cat after the ritual at the end of the film. Like I said, very confusing.

In conclusion, Cats really is one of the worst films ever made. Some people say it's so bad its good but I disagree with that. Its not for the faint of heart and I would only recommend it if you're genuinely curious to how bad it is. If there's anything good I can say about this movie, its that some of the instrumentals are not too bad but they don't save it from the abysmal disaster that it is."

2.0,18 June 2023,"Adapting a theatre play to cinema is not something mechanical, as both arts are very different. Doing that is ever harder when there is not a traditional narrative structure in the play. That is precisely the case of the musical show. The outcome was weird, boring, repetitious. The idea of mixing live action actors with CGI had a strange effect with which I never became fully accostumed to. Aestethics is also excessively kitsch, not balancing with other exaggerated traits, such as overacting. Not everything is bad, for sure: cute Francesca Hayward has a very good performance (acting, dancing and singing), Jennifer Hudson sings beautifully and melancholically ""Memory"", the moves immitating cats are nice, and some segments in the ending, such as Mr. Mistoffelees's spells and the ""Jellicle Choice"", are much better than the precedent ones. Anyway, the movie is bad, what is surprising for a filmmaker such as Tom Hopper, who previously directed several good films: The Damned United, The King's Speech, Les Misérables, and The Danish Girl, just to mention the ones I have watched. What a waste of having Judi Dench and Ian McKellen in the casting! There is a serious problem in the script here; it is hard to believe that the writer, Lee Hall, is the same of Bily Elliot. All gags are quite bad, unfunny, silly. Rebel Wilson is particularly annoying. There is not a cinematic narrative that can connect the musical presentation of the vrious characters in a reasonable pace. By the way, I know this is a problem that appeared already in the stage show and that was not in T. S. Eliot's poems, but only female cats have three-coloured fur."

6.0,23 April 2020,"Y'all, at first I thought people were just being mean and over exaggerating... but this film is sincerely bad. The CGI is bad. Rebel Wilson's character gets some of the worst scenes ever created. Some songs go on FURever!! I had to.

The reason I gave it a 2, however, Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory brought actual emotion to the screen."
3.0,26 December 2019,"The story and songs we know and love. The only downfall is the cgi in places, but that is something you can look by.

1.0,1 June 2021,"They should make a boring musical about magical, singing dogs so the whole 'cats vs. Dogs' thing is more even. If you're wandering whether you should watch this musical adaptation, there's one word you'll need to take with you: Don't!

Despite its talented cast, Cats is honestly a really creepy and strange musical for families. What makes this film strange and creepy is the magic, as well as the actual human-cat-singers themselves. They're totally unfunny and the whole story is overlong. Actually, the film is overlong; there is no story at all. And even if there was a story, it would be ruined and unrecognised thanks to the constantly boring singing. So don't go home and get angry at your cat because of some really bad musical.

But that's only if you own a cat. If you're a cat-lover, please don't feel like you need or have to watch this film to prove your love for cats. Cats is just a bunch of kitty-dressed humans doing boring dances and singing songs that'll most likely bring you right away from the screen, so don't pay for this movie without a single part of your mind telling you that you won't be shaken up after the first 10 minutes.

Without a story, Cats is completely pointless. The whole film is horrendously boring and is a perfect way to waste your money.

3.0,3 August 2021,"Some parts where watchable and I mean if you just forward to the parts where J Hudson sings, it's even enjoyable.

But a movie that makes I Elba look like a very bad actor sure proves to have done many things very wrong :("
5.0,7 May 2021,"In 1939 T. S. Eliot wrote a collection of poetry called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Nearly 50 years later in 1981 Andrew Lloyd Webber managed to tie this whimsical anthology together with a thin and questionable plot combined with some of the best music and costumes Broadway had ever seen. Now 38 years later, that musical is getting a film adaption that tries even harder to force a plot into existence and look as pretty as possible; at the expense of all else. A goal, that if they had succeeded, may have even been enough to save the film. Reality is rarely so kind, however.

While no one can deny that director Tom Hooper was able to obtain some serious talent, pulling in Hollywood heavyweights like Judi Dench, Ian McKellen and Idris Elba, the script that Hooper and Lee Hall wrote for the film gives the actors so little to work with that even they end up looking like bad parodies of themselves. Combined with what was done to the iconic music of the play, shortened run times, absent pieces, invented inserts, and arbitrary cutaways, even the musical giants dragged into this mess, such as Jason Derulo, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, and Rebel Wilson were made a mockery of. My own personal thoughts about Taylor swift aside, I can respect the song written for this production, (Beautiful ghosts) as an exceptional song, but its inclusion doesn't make up for what was removed.

All these factors together with the (rightfully) controversial aesthetic of the film. Mean that while this film clearly had a budget that could make any non-Disney producer nervous. It doesn't end up with anything that actually looks good. It's striking certainly, but in the way a defaced print of the Mona Lisa is striking. It draws your attention and makes you look closer in order to work out exactly what the situation is, but it doesn't make you happy to see it and it certainly doesn't inspire a second viewing.

To give credit where it is due thou, Cats does possess one saving grace that may yet secure its place in pop culture as something other than a burning train wreck. The dancing. As anyone who has seen In the Heights or Hamilton can tell you, Andy Blankenbuehler is one hell of a choreographer. With classically trained Ballet stars such as Francesca Hayward, Steven McRae, Robert Fairchild and Eric Underwood working alongside new-age dancers such as Les Twins and others. Blankenbuehler makes use of all their unique skills and puts them all on display one after the other. If nothing else, this film stands a wonderful showcase of dance styles and techniques.

Alas, Cats is not a dance theatre performance, it is a live-action adaption. Here we reach the sliding scale of success vs relevancy. As a performance showcase, it is quite good. As a musical film, it is alright. As a theatrical film debuting alongside Star Wars, it is bland and forgettable at best. As an adaption of Andrew Lloyd Webbers Broadway masterpiece, it is an insult and worthy of a public apology to all those unfortunate fans unlucky enough to have bought tickets."

5.0,30 January 2021,...but I didn't. I gave it a two because all the actors were very enthusiastic.
4.0,3 November 2020,"I rarely review television shows or movies, but I felt compelled to speak out against this abomination of my favorite musical of all time. I cannot tell you just how horrible this movie was, at least for me. I knew there would be elements from the Broadway musical, that simply cannot translate to the screen. The intimacy and the relationship between the Cats and the audience is sadly missing. I was a HUGE fan of the Broadway musical so much so that I went to see it 8 times. It's such a wonderful experience, I just kept taking new friends to see it. The only thing I can say is that it was magical for me and my friends.

The stage version was very simplistic. The stage and the seating was setup as an old tire, from a junkyard, the audience was one half of the tire and the stage the other half. As the musical progresses, the cats go out into the audience, they are playful, affectionate, prowled and stalk the audience members, while the rest of the cats are performing on stage. They would rub their head on your leg sometimes they would roll over for a belly rub. Eight times it was never the same, they each did something different every time we went. The audience becomes part of the play and that is what draws you in.

When I went to see it for the first time, one of the cats rubbed it's head against my leg, your so engrossed by what is happening on the stage, that when it rubbed my leg I jumped a foot in the air. That seems to be what happens to a lot of people. Two cats started fighting, another time it hissed at me. Another time it wanted me to rub its head. I had heard that they had to study cat movements for about 6 weeks before joining the company.

Number one, the film musical is way over produced, the backdrops looks like a soundstage. The musical NEVER left the junkyard, they didn't go wandering around London. They had beat up old cars and the cats would climb through the windows and pop out of the trunk. The props in this movie are kind of tacky. The glamour cat, Grizabella, we got very lucky to see one of Betty Buckley's last performances, we all got goosepimples from her performance of that famous song. She will always be Grizabella to me. We saw it with Elaine Paige too. Grizabella is in the first number ""Jellico Cats"" in the Broadway version and she's not even there in the movie version. I like Jennifer Hudson, but I don't like her version of Memories, her voice is too big for that role of an older vulnerable cat, as she remembers how much she was once loved and then discarded.

I found Taylor Swift, James Corden and Rebel Wilson a distraction. They hyped up Taylor Swift, who is in the movie less than 5 or 10 minutes. Another thing that bothers me is cats don't have brown eyes. None of the cats in the stage musical had brown eyes. I was NOT impressed by Taylor Swift dancing or singing ability; she has a pop voice NOT a Broadway musical voice. I actually find her a bit annoying. Same with Rebel Wilson. There personalities are just too big.

Sometimes it's better to leave these things well enough alone. Hollywood should have NEVER made this movie, they removed what was so special and magical from the stage versions. Sometimes it's appropriate to just say no. I hear they'll be making Wicked into a movie and they will probably destroy that musical as well, what ""star"" will be singing and mangling the song Gravity (another showstopper). Please don't ruin that musical Hollywood. Hollywood once again, ruined something that was so special and magical. They should be ashamed of themselves. The audience it's part of the stage musical, in the movie your just an observer. What the hell were they thinking? I would give this movie a zero, but it won't let you do that, so I will give it 1 OUT of 10."
1.0,27 April 2020,Because of the comic relief of Sir Ian McKellen as Gus...the regalness of Dame Judi Dench and the excellent rendition of Memories by the talented Jennifer Hudson.

I was confused at first but I recognized the poem, the play is the poem , now I get it. There were some beautiful moments for sure; . Overall, the premise , the story and specifically the music, are outstanding. The songs oddly familiar and quite catchy , really quite lovely . Jennifer Hudson was exceptional, she legitimized the whole production and galvanized my interest . I am a Sci fi fan and so cgi isn't critical to a good movie but this took real time to get used to, a bit 'uncanny 'but maybe it's meant to be ? The whole show was dancing yet I was a bit thrown by the caliber of the numbers . Maybe it was made to look too easy or to feel accessible ? Some of the choices were too pg for this to be a children's movie , had it been meant specifically for kids ' like broadway for kids ' the experience would have been more understandable.

I am checking back in to report that I STILL have the some of the songs running through my mind"

1.0,11 May 2020,"""Oscillating between a cat's immanent quadruped gait and its human player's biped posture, from the word go, CATS betrays the misalignment of its content's anthropomorphism and its cast's zoomorphism, which becomes perniciously distracting for audience to emphasize with the uncanny creatures on the screen, unlike in a live theater, where performers' spontaneity and virtuosity can keep viewers riveting and suspending any disbelief, here, this fancifully concocted, pre-recorded commodity with every feline impersonator slinking, leaping and dancing in perfect synchrony, belting out in perfect pitch, has a much harder time to win its fans of a different medium.""

6.0,6 November 2020,"Oh boy, if ever there was a movie that I had to watch because everyone said how bad it was, Cats is it. Nothing could be as awful, as wretched, as eye assaultingly bad as Cats is made out to be, could it? Short answer: No. Don't get me wrong, this is a bad movie, but I don't get the rage people seem to harbor toward it. It's weird, awkward, clunky and makes zero sense and doesn't try to and is filled with CGI that is at best very, very odd and at worst bile-inducing. That describes most of Michael Bay's filmography and people still flock in droves to his disasters without all this raucous about them.

Let me say it, I didn't think the CGI was all that bad for the majority of this film. The problem I have is that when you try to make real people look like realistic CGI anthromorphic cats and have them try to imitate catlike gestures things get really weird, really fast. That's pretty much this movie though, we're dumped into this world with no real explanation for anything, there's a lot of gibberish spoken that means nothing to anyone and we're off to the races with song after song after song along with a litany of cameos and big names donning the whiskers. At no point do I care in the slightest bit about any of it, possible because at no point do they bother to explain any of it using English.

That's the biggest problem though, to me. It's not the CGI or the story or any of that. It's seeing all these exceptional actors being put in these ridiculous facades and made to do absurd and disgraceful things. Sir Ian Mckellen should not have anything to do with this, nor should Dame Judi Dench or Idris Elba. This is a black mark on at least two legendary careers and one with a great deal of promise still.

The music is fine, a couple of songs have some weight to them but they're all undercut by that recurring theme of I DON'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THIS! Try to blackmail me emotionally all you want with the swelling tones and beautiful voices but if I'm not the least bit invested in these things then you might as well belt out.a ballad to soggy bread because I just don't care.

That's the story of Cats. I just don't care. A week from now I'll have forgotten most of what I'd seen and simply remember this was bad and not bother with it again. There's no great anger or emotional connection because there was nothing to connect to. I turned it on, 110 minutes later it was over and that was that. Barely a flick of the needle, nary a twitch of the gauge. It was, then it wasn't.

Don't watch this though. Movies should illicit some sort of reaction beyond indifference. Go find something that'll bring some joy, something that'll make you think or something that'll upset you, I have some of my favorite movie conversations about movies that really annoyed me. There's no conversation here, I'll finish typing and it will leave my memory banks and-"
2.0,19 April 2020,I went in with a 10 and dropped down fairly quickly. Maybe it would have worked better as an animation.

3.0,6 January 2020,"I was taken aback by all of the negative reviews of this movie, but have been eagerly anticipating its release, and I was certainly not disappointed. I could see how those who are not familiar with the stage play may critique the lack of a plot, but I actually felt that the movie was much improved in this area. I found myself understanding and seeing underlying themes in a way never fully realized in the stage version. I loved the new song by Taylor Swift and the role that Victoria played in the narrative as a whole. The casting was almost spot on, and I found myself brought to tears at the emotional climax. Of particular note, the fantastic performances by Judy Dench, Francesca Hayward, Robert Fairchild, Laurie Davidson, and Jennifer Hudson really stood out to me. The characters felt as if they had so much more depth, particularly the dramatically different portrayal of Mr. Mistoffolees. The choreography and staging were beautiful. I cannot wait to go back to the theatre to see this again and will defimitely be adding this to my DVD collection."

The songs were terrible, the film didn't make any sense, the cats looked traumatizing and it was almost like the creator of this just said I want"" CATS"" and used amazing actors and actresses for a bad film, To conclude, it was just a terrible film, Listen to the reviews and don't watch it it will be a waste of your time and money. Amazing actresses/actors talent gone to waste because of this film.

Appalling."
3.0,2 January 2022,I don't think this movie needs many words for its review. Only the word EWW would service. This movie would have been ok if it were an animated feature or the cast actually had costumes like the stage show.
1.0,25 December 2019,I have no desire to live after watching this. I've wasted 1.5hr of my life.
9.0,6 February 2021,It could have been a really nice movie if the talented cast had just gotten good costumes.
6.0,26 March 2020,I did not understand whether it was 1 hour 50 minutes movie or music clip. And I was able to last half an hour. I had a lot of hopes and completely disappointed unfortunately.
3.0,21 January 2024,"Expensive adaptation of a lousy show. ""They move like cats,"" and once you get past that there's nothing left for you in this movie. Don't blame it on the big-name celebrities, they did their jobs. The creators did an awful job: bad book, poor lyrics, boring music (except for two tunes). It was true on Broadway/West End and it's true on film.

Andrew Lloyd Webber enjoyed a phase during which he could do no wrong. Every piece of crap he tossed out was received like a gift from heaven, Cats included.

The sets were lush and Cats was beautifully filmed. And I would watch Judi Dench take trash out to her bins because I think she's so wonderful."
1.0,19 May 2020,"I cannot repeat that enough. Cats the theatre production is amazing! Please do not ruin a magical show forever by watching this strange mess.

I am not a musical fan to be honest BUT I do absolutely love the theatre version. It is super cool, both the set and the performers fill you with awe throughout! Songs are CATchy! A truly wonderful experience that I decided to happily relive when my local Playhouse put it up again a few years after seeing it the first time. It is that good!

Then this film came out and I was quite excited. But this is not anything like the theatre. It is not even a little bit good. It is not even bad. It is beyond disturbing. What even are they? They are strangely human and not feline enough to feel like cats - but nor human enough to feel like people in costumes. Cats with weird peoples' faces and bodies but covered in fur and added pointy ears. If it sounds sort of fun - it is not! Yuck! Odd. Creepy. Not haha creepy. Just really wrong!

I tried to watch the whole thing. I really did. Between feeling a tad sickened and really confused, I managed to somehow push through. Until they murdered 'Memory'! That's when the hurt and disgust got to much to handle. I had enough and turned off this godforsaken mess. Please listen to the reviews. Don't put yourself through this catastrophe!"
1.0,30 December 2019,"I was apprehensive before going to see this, as a massive fan of the stage musical, but it did not disappoint! From the incredible dancing (interesting to see a previous reviewer claim that Francesca Hayward in the role of Victoria could neither dance nor sing - interesting, as she is a principal with the Royal Ballet - pretty good for someone who 'can't dance'!) to the outstanding vocals throughout. My only complaint was I saw it in the cinema, so I couldn't join in with singing and dancing!"
2.0,17 October 2020,"Wow just wow. Maybe the haters are die hard cats (play) fans, but it's nowhere as bad as some lead. First off never saw play, can't wait to though. And second I think this movie/play was more along lines of Disney than Broadway. I enjoyed that childhood charm. I didn't need Broadway, but I throughly enjoyed singing to songs myself or wife never heard of!! I really enjoyed that, and I think Andrew Lloyd Weber and guy who wrote the original poems back in the 30s would really appreciate that!

Judge for yourself and sing along while you do."
1.0,16 January 2022,"This bizarre film begins with an act of cruelty so unnecessary and shocking I am sure it alienated many viewers who might have been more indulgent toward this adaptation. If anyone wonders whether this film could possibly be as bad as everyone says--YES, it can, and it indeed is. From the obvious CGI in the opening dance number (reminded me of what the musical version of ""Avatar"" might look like), to some inexplicable casting, it's just horrible. Even if you watch the film for free, you will end up paying."
10.0,31 January 2022,"I saw cats on stage, i tolerated it. Some things were not meant to be made into a movie. This was one. Idris is impressive as always and Taylor Swift sang a good McCavity cat. Aside, it was just terrible."
6.0,9 November 2020,"Once you get over their creepy faces and non-existent storyline, it's kinda fun to watch. But I saw the stage show as a small child and was entranced, so I'm mostly in it for the nostalgia."
10.0,27 May 2020,This has put me off getting a cat. I have made the controversial move from cats to dogs. This is dreadful. I didn't even need to watch this year's Razzies to know this would get the most.
6.0,2 October 2020,"As a musical film the concept is fine, and the CG is great, but everybodies performance was on the floor. Everyone was acting tough or pretty, and panicky non-stop. Not breathing properly.

Ian McKellen and Taylor Swift were the two main performances which made the movie a pleasure to watch. Rebel Wilson and Judi Dench's needed polish. Skip everything else."

8.0,27 April 2022,"The only good thing to come out of this epic failure was a live stream How Did This Get Made episode early on during covid. The only reason to watch this is to prep for the HDTGM where they rip it to shreds, even then I'm not sure it was worth it."
6.0,25 December 2019,"You can clearly see from the first minute how much work the dancers and actors put in this movie. That's why I think it's unfair to review it as bas as most people do because the CGI is strange and unusual - which is strange and scary in some places. But this should not affect your opinion on the performance itself. All dancers are super professional and the songs are beautiful. Cats is a classic and it's very difficult to adapt any theatre peace and put it on the big screens. There were some failings from the part of the director and team of visual effects but the performers were great. Please go, see the movie and judge it yourself."
10.0,1 January 2020,"Right I'm going exppress my own opinions and not just follow everyone else.In my opinion there is nothing wrong with cats other then scale in some scenes. The music on was bang on with a coupe of extras Scores added. I believe cats has been given a bad wrap For no justified reason. Storyline makes a good transition between stage and screen. CGI Unless your going to go full animated or use real cats it's always going to look strange humans playing cats! But so what. How can people review a film if don't watch the whole film? The Scale between the cats and furnitures can be better. So watch this film if you like musicals if you don't ,don't."

10.0,25 January 2021,
7.0,8 January 2024,"I do not understand those pining for the stage production. I saw CATS in London and hated it. I watched this film out of morbid curiosity and it's better; the story (such as it is) is better presented, and the close-ups help. Still, most of this film was tedious. Despite impressive set pieces, costumes and CGI, most of the music sucks and the constant over-the-top dance numbers don't help. Most of the first half feels like watching a bunch of celebrities frolicking at a furry meet (yuck!). It may be Andrew Lloyd Webber, but this is no Phantom of the Opera. However, there are redeeming factors.

Ballerina Francesca Hayward is a delight. She is arguably the star (she plays recently abandoned Victoria, who is shy but curious). The other cats explain things to her, so the camera mostly follows her around. She is easy on the eyes (even in costume).

Jennifer Hudson is fantastic as Grizabella, the washed-up loner cat no one likes (except for innocent ingenue Victoria). I'm a sappy guy, and Grizabella's sad, forlorn look was extremely moving. But when she sings Memory, it's a tear-jerker (and available on YT).

Taylor Swift (as Bombalurina) has a great number. Her stage presence is impressive, even when compared to Judi Dench and Ian McKellen (who were both good).

The second half of the film is by far the best. There are themes of kindness, love, hope, and charity, and one starts wondering about allegorical intent. If you are too jaded to see this, well, that's unfortunate.

This is a zero-star film concept, but I give it bonus stars for Hayward, Hudson, and Swift. That's three (3) stars total. ""Normal"", non-sappy people should probably avoid this."

10.0,1 April 2020,Cats is not a MUST WATCHABLE movie. But it is a best in musical feast. Just average movie. Don't hear negative reviews.
7.0,12 October 2020,"I loved the theatrical production. The energy, dancing and music. No plot, pure imagination. Cats has the same problem as the movie adaptation of Les Miz. Trying to make a sensible plot from musicals that are primarily song (Les Miz) and dance (Cats). Trying to bring in big names who can't sing or dance and give them screen time at the expense of what has made these great musicals. In Cats the excessive use of close ups takes away the magic of the dance ensemble. Jennifer Hudson was a highlight but her screen time was too brief. Next time just film the Broadway production."
9.0,11 October 2020,"In 1998 they brought the one-and-only (and it SHOULD have been) ""Cats"" to film. Look it up, watch it and hopefully you'll get this version out of your head. The only thing worse than the singing was the acting. Even Judi Dench couldn't redeem this version. If I hadn't seen it myself I would never have believed it possible to take a great show with great music by a great composer and a previously made great video and destroy it all so completely."
6.0,27 December 2019,"Opinions are like buttholes, everyone's got one. But man alive, I think Cats has gotten a raw deal! My daughter (15) and myself (44) went last night and LOVED it! And I mean LOVED it. Visually stunning and a beautiful interpretation is definitely achieved. My daughter is very passionate about Cats, it's her favorite. We've seen it a couple times now (off Broadway) and she was in awe. She claims that the average person will never get it and I think she's right. All I can say, is that it's great and we would see it again. Amazing performances by all!"
10.0,6 May 2020,"The movie ""Cats"" is a clever adaptation of a complex idea that our view of animal species reflects our own complexity. The characteristics historically assigned to cats are here given back to us as a story that successfully reminds us of the commonality behind the diversity of individual human experiences. There are different aspects of this commonality portrayed but the main moment of our unification is the oldest idea of hope and the yearning for new chances.

Having watched the movie after reading and rereading a bunch of negative reviews I've come to the conclusion that the movie is being hated unjustly. Most of the user reviews online are hardly articulate focusing on irrelevant things, giving short emotional outbursts or just trying to be funny because its fun to ride the negative review hype train. Practically no argumentation is given on why the movie is as awful as those users would have us believe.

Reviews by established critics are not that bad but fall into the nostalgia rabbit hole or judge this movie by the place it has in the directors career. Others focus on the quality of the CGI which is good in as much that it never becomes a problem (only perhaps for those who need an angle to write their payed for negative reviews). Some again think that their cynicism will explain to them what is happening in the movie and because of it fail to address the content in a meaningful way. I agree with reviews saying that dancing choreographies could be more interesting and I agree that they do sometimes confuse the viewer who is trying to relate them to the story, but these are isolated moments and not an overall problem. Most reviews, I think, fall short in understanding the movie at all and the point it tries to convey.

When I have first seen the trailer the very weirdness of the human-cats is what actually caused some amazement in me. It felt like a strangeness I had to see or explore. Returning to my first paragraph, it think now that it was a strangeness that was clearly showing me that there is some unique familiarity which the movie beckoned me to understand. This understanding it definitively delivered.

Finally, I think the critics have been uncritical and have facilitated an elitism of genre and medium which was then unsuccessfully parroted by anyone who thinks an internet connection entitles him to have a relevant opinion. Mine, of course, also falls into that category but at least I'm not a parrot - yes, it could be that I'm a cat :)"
7.0,29 March 2020,Two stars purely for Jennifer Hudson singing memory. Enough has been written about how awful everything else about this movie is. So will just leave it there.
8.0,20 March 2021,"As a life-long fan of the Webber musical I was actually quite excited at the announcement of the movie. If anything, it made me appreciate the musical even more. People in tight suits with whiskers painted on their face will forever be more convincing than this furry nightmare. Also...Judi Dench can't sing. Love her, but whoever chose to cast her in a musical should be fired. Along with anyone else who allowed this movie onto screens."
7.0,21 November 2020,"First, the good. ""Memory"" is one of the finest Broadway song and Jennifer Hudson is a great singer. The railway Cat song is actually really good and I even like the Taylor Swift song. Robbie Fairchild and Francesca Hayward are good.

Some scene are ok, Ian McKellen was kinda funny in a weird way.

Cats as a musical is all about great singing and great dancing. The story is a total non sense. It's tough to make a movie about a story with no story. We could see with the better part that this movie could be an even a good musical.

BUT.... terrible choices were made. Nothing is in scale, the CGI are terrible, WTF Rebel Wilson, James Corden, nobody seems to be in the same movie (Jennifer Hudson was in try hard Oscars bait movie, while Rebel Wilson was in a gross comedy with CGI cockroaches), the movie should end like 15 minutes earlier, nothing make sense."

8.0,20 January 2021,"I can describe how bad is this movie, give 2 stars for vocal."
7.0,18 March 2020,"I'm going to start with the good so It's not a full post about negative. First off the art direction was visually striking and almost beautiful if you ignore the cats. Ian McKellen acting was a work of art like usual and it helps that he didn't move like the other cats. The Skimbleshanks tap dancing was also a fun watch.

Now on to the negative as there was a lot. First off I don't understand the direction they took with the character design. They went so deep into the cat side that it looked weird. I actually didn't mind the old style or maybe more human. There was also a problem with their movements and dance as it felt sexual and there were times I almost thought some characters were going to kiss or something. I was honestly hoping for a good change as they could have updated the music to add more verity. I could easily imagine some of those songs in a rock, indie, or whatever than the same music that feels very 80's.

I also hate that they even decided to add Rebel Wilson to the cast. Whenever I see her in any movie she feels like the same girl with disgusting humor and this is no different. There were also a lot of characters that didn't even sing well. I guess they would rather get big names than good characters for the part."
8.0,25 November 2020,"This latest screen adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical was widely panned by both critics and viewers (currently 2.8/10 on IMDb). I read some of the reviews and here are my thoughts:

1. If you're not a fan of musicals, you'll hate it. 2. If you're looking for a plot, there isn't one and you'll hate it. 3. If you've been a fan of Cats in the past - whether from watching it on stage or the music itself - you'll probably like this. Otherwise, you won't. 4. If you expect that humans can perfectly act out cats' mannerisms to anyone's satisfaction, you'll be sorely disappointed. 5. If you're looking for melodious tracks, you'll hate this. There is only one memorable tune in the original: Memory. I personally didn't like Jennifer Hudson's version here. I preferred Francesca Hayward's part in the two reprises. All other songs in the original pretty much have very little melody and are therefore forgettable. But they wrote a few new songs in this remake and one, 'Beautiful Ghosts,' is enough reason for you to watch this. Both Hayward and Taylor Swift sing it and both versions are good. If you don't plan to watch the film, at least listen to that song. I liked it enough to add to my music library.

CASTING, ACTING They cast a powerhouse of performers - Ian McKellen, Jennifer Hudson, Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo, Judi Dench, Idris Elba, James Corden, Rebel Wilson. Everyone did a good job acting out their roles. The singing is top notch.

CGI, EFFECTS I disagree with critics who panned the visual effects. I thought the visuals made for high production values. What they did right: they kept the actors' eyes so human emotion matched the feelings they were exuding from the lyrics. Compare this with the new Lion King where the animation barely conveyed any emotion from the scenes.

Did I like the movie? No. I could only give it 3/10 because I'm not a fan to begin with. Even though I like Webber's The Phantom of the Opera and Jesus Christ Superstar (his best I think), I'm just not a fan of Cats.

To summarize, watch this only if you liked Cats in the past. Otherwise, stay away."
7.0,15 November 2020,
10.0,10 February 2020,"While the Broadway show of Cats is dismissed by many as trifling, it does manage to have a semblance of a point: a community of characters, young and old, with its cliques and its cruelties, ceremoniously assert their identities and practice celebrating their differences in an audition for salvation. In the end, the cat who has suffered the most is chosen, and they unite in their communal identity, as cats.

This movie kicks off its misunderstanding of this simple idea from its first character piece. In the stage show, Jennyanydots defies cat-ly expectations with her industriousness and motherly compassion for mice and beetles. In the movie, the character tortures and randomly eats her charges, and is otherwise undifferentiated from other selfish preening cats. Instead of a community of outcasts and misfits that come together, the cats in the movie are mostly unpleasant vandals unmoved by these stories. Even the slight and sappy tale of Grizabella, the only real arc in the original, is robbed of meaning and feels more random than compassionate. The final invocation to the audience is played directly to the camera in close up (!) and makes no effort to show the group as having matured from, or even having participated in, a communal ritual.

I had hoped to at least enjoy Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography. Instead, the hyperactive and intrusive camera and visual effects demote the movement from its own emotional language to just another visual effect. The music is fully present, but that was never the show's strongest suit.

I'm sorry Cats: The Movie is unable to properly introduce new audiences to the quirky and wholesome source material. See the stage show instead. It still tours, and it still brings down houses."
7.0,18 April 2021,"While watching the film version, I couldn't help but wonder why this play went on to become such a theatrical phenomenon worldwide. I have to admit that during the live production I saw in Toronto many years ago I fell asleep. It has an off-beat story, it has actors pretending to be cats, and only one famous song emerged from it. Nonetheless, the musical's success led to the inevitable 2019 film version.

The film on the other hand did not enjoy any of the raves heaped on the theatrical version. And this time audiences stayed away in droves. So what is so horrible about the movie and why is it so notoriously bad?

Let me start by mentioning that, for me, the movie has some wonderful musical segments with terrific choreography, visual effects and energy. The production design is top notch. The director generally knows where to put the camera and the editing is excellent rather than simply frenetic. The actors for the most part all seem committed and game and give it their all. The dancing is crisp and wonderfully executed, and there are a lot of sight gags and humorous moments. And count me in as one of those who watched this film to the end. So far so good, right?

Sadly, pretty much all of the singing is dreadful. Rebel Wilson is particularly screechy even though she has one of the best production numbers. Francesca Hayward plays the young female lead and while she is pretty and an excellent dancer, her singing during her big number is painfully tinny. I didn't mind the switching from talking to singing, and credit to the actors/singers who enunciated clearly. Rare for a musical, the performers were intelligible and I was able to enjoy the lyrics. But the vocal quality so often was just plain bad. Jennifer Hudson is completely awful in the movie and her scenes are excruciating to watch. Her characterization of Grizabella is melodramatic and bizarre, and her singing is amateur and wretched if not totally flat. She absolutely tortures the play's most famous song ""Memories"", and made me think that no-one will be buying this film's soundtrack. Taylor Swift indeed was in this production but lucky for her she had a very small role and very short screen time towards the end of the film. Just enough of course, to add to the pile of mistakes the movie had become by that point. For some very strange reason she did her cat with a British accent which was jarring, and her dancing and smirking for the camera did not portend any notion of a future acting career.

I didn't have a huge problem with the costumes and makeup. After watching many years of Star Trek, I think we've all become accustomed to seeing actors in humanoid costumes. But there was still plenty that was off-putting. The characters were supposed to be cats, not humanoid cats, yet they were acting more human than cats. Even when they were supposed to be rubbing up against each other as cats do the actors suddenly got tentative as if not to breach another's personal space. And the way they moved around in groups and in shots of them jumping on things, I often thought they looked and moved more like monkeys than cats! But that being the said, watching Ian McKellen lapping at a giant pool of liquid was just plain wrong. Many of the actors wore clothes over their cat costumes yet sometimes we saw them without clothes which I think was a big mistake. That juxtaposition was especially awkward towards the end of the film when Idris Elba as Macavity did his big musical number 'naked' . The creepy visual could not be ignored and will be hard to erase from memory.

Some scenes went on way too long and the storyline weak. Most damaging, the dramatic portion of the film was centered on Grizabella which only drew further attention to Jennifer Hudson's awkward and amateurish performance. By the time she sails away to Heaviside or whatever it's supposed to be, this viewer was glad to see the credits roll.

Turning this play into a feature film was not going to be easy. But we did see a level of creativity and artistic energy up on the screen as well as some really good performers. Judi Dench brought some grounded acting chops to this production in spite of her woeful singing abilities. Likewise performers Robbie Fairchild as Munkustrap and the excellent Laurie Davidson as Mr. Mistoffelees should not be criticised. So for effort and some good moments amidst all its missteps, I am generously rating Cats as a 3/10."
9.0,22 August 2020,I'd rather watch grass grow than witness another minute of this sin against God.
7.0,9 January 2020,We saw this movie last night and my wife and I both liked it. All of the negative reviews are unfair and overblown. I've seen the stage version twice and this is a rare occasion where I actually liked the movie better. The music and choreography are great. They bring out the story better than either the book or the play. There were a couple of parts that were dumb. Grundy cat to be specific but it didn't warrant all of the negative reviews. We recommend it.
10.0,8 January 2020,"I think people would appreciate it more if they liked the stage version. I grew up with the video. I certainly enjoyed this film, except for noticeable glitches in cgi and that Jennyanydots scene was a bit barmy! The choreography is brilliant and the songs beautiful/catchy. Don't be put off by negative critics. Go see it and make up your own mind."
6.0,25 April 2020,"I don't want to knock it like everyone else, since the cats do look cool and a lot of work went into it, but the movie is just extraordinarily dull. I tried to watch it like 5x and just couldn't sit through it.

It reminds me of all the shows in the 80s that they thought people would love and ended up not being able to sit through. I still feel like I'm not being that harsh by saying this though, so maybe this movie is just really bad. Not saying I haven't seen worse, however."

10.0,15 June 2021,"I'm usually a very positive person, but I'm struggling here. I saw Cats live way back when it was showing in London, and my family and I stayed in the Hotel Russell (""Up, up, up, past the Russell Hotel"") - what a treat that was.

But this, what can I say? The costumes were beautiful and so was Francesca Hayward, playing Victoria. I hung on to hear Grizabella sing Memory; one of my all time favourite musical songs, but I was sadly disappointed. Jennifer Hudson cannot sing. It was truly dreadful. I could feel my whole body tensing up, so I fast forwarded through the rest of her song, and much of the remaining film. I did, however, enjoy the Magical Mr Mistoffelees scene, which included a reprise of Memory. I found that painful too, but perhaps it was supposed to be like that as it was a heavy scene; it was emotional, but not so musical, and I think Elaine Paige and Anita Harris (who played Grizabella in the performance that I saw) might agree.

If you haven't already seen Elaine Paige's version, it is available on YouTube."
6.0,24 May 2020,"Like, don't know where to start with this nightmarish, abominable and disastrous trainwreck. Nothing about Cats really works as a film, which really justifies the point that not everything can be translated well into a film and Cats should have just been stuck on the stages of Broadway and West End and by making it into a film, the results are nothing but disastrous.

Everything about Cats just makes it completely bizarre, unwatchable, grotesque, disgusting and unappealing. First, the CGI and its visual effects are utterly horrifying and atrocious, which sinks the film into an uncanny valley, given that much of the problems of the movie itself are laid on the decision to have the actors appear as cats through motion performance capture, with their recognizable faces being awkwardly grafted onto digital, humanoid cat models. Not to mention that the appearance of CGI mice and cockroaches within the film and its overreliance of green screen, offers the film no good and redeemable favors. Also, the looks and features within this movie also draws negatives comparisons of movies that are feline-related such as 1996's The Island of Dr. Moreau, 2003's Cat in the Hat, and 2004's Catwoman.

Another issue of this movie comes with Tom Hooper's horrible and awful direction, which is completely shocking, considering the fact that he's crafted brilliant movies before, such as The King's Speech (for which he won an Oscar for his austere direction, with the movie itself winning Best Picture), Les Misérables and The Danish Girl. In Cats, his direction on this movie is completely scattered-brain, unfocused and thoroughly messy, with its generic coverage of marquee sequences which feels rushed and abrupt, inconsistent pacing as well as heavily chopped-in and metronomic editing while overly reliant on both close-ups and extreme wide shots; giving it no style or personality to the filmmaking. Worse, the live singing approach that he employed within this movie was pointless and unnecessary, while giving a disservice for the cast members who can't simultaneously act and sing at the same time.

Third, some of the songs within this movie that were adapted from the stage musical (with the exception of ""Memory"") were utterly dated, repetitive, obnoxious and strange, with the rest of its musical numbers turned out to be cringeworthy and abysmal, and while some of these songs were celebrated in its prime; nowadays, most of these songs have entered into self-parody.

Fourth, the tone for Cats is completely strange, off-putting, confusing and constantly jarring, which makes the film struggle of finding its identity, with the film erratically jumping from a comedy or an epic musical fantasy or a family-friendly genre, which makes the film completely odd. Making matters worse comes with the virtually non-existent plot, which sums up the earlier statement that not every material or medium can be translated into film, and this film proves it. With the absence of plot, it also makes it difficult for the audiences of understanding this film. Rather than expanding its wafer-thin narrative, Tom Hooper and his co-screenwriter, Lee Hall (of whom the latter is behind of some of the character-driven and in-depth screenplays such as 2000's Billy Elliot, 2011's War Horse, and most recently, 2019's Rocketman) doubles down on its thin storyline by playing safe and not taking boldly creative risk on the story and instead relying on its elaborate song-and-dance routines to keep the audiences interested (of which the audiences will get bored and uncomfortable of watching it).

And fifth, comes with the terrible performances of James Corden, Rebel Wilson and Taylor Swift as Bustopher Jones, Jennyanydots, and Bombalurina. As for the former, he gives a deeply grating performance, with a lame ""comic relief"" sketch and a totally flat musical number, while Wilson was basically just acting out on a feline version of her usual shtick in the worst ways possible, and lacks the ripe singing voice to make it interesting, and as for the latter, Swift simply acts out in a pretentious manner and comes off as utterly distracting, not to mentioned that she gives a horrible British accent. Also, the comedy within the film, made it unfunny and cringeworthy. Furthermore, the supporting performances of Idris Elba, Ray Winstone, as well as acting legends such as Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Judi Dench are completely squandered and wasted, with the latter two simply giving embarrassing performances, of which it draws similar yet terrible parallels of great actors giving terrible performances in terrible movies such as Sir Patrick Stewart in The Emoji Movie and Al Pacino in Jack and Jill.

However, Cats had a few redeemable qualities that stood out in this horrible mess. One of the most important aspects of the film is that it managed to nail the singing right, for which most of it was good, despite its horrible and distracting CGI. Of all the members of the cast that stood out, Jennifer Hudson gave out her scene-stealing and riveting performance as Grizabella, with her stirring genuinely stirring rendition of ""Memory"", which serves as a highlight in this dreadful movie. Despite giving out a bad acting and a bad accent to boot, Taylor Swift somehow managed to nail a good singing performance and a good musical number, while nailing the high-camp tone the movie seeks of. At the same time, the dance choreography is also strong across the board, in spite of Tom Hooper's lackluster direction. Lastly, the production design of the film itself is also exceptionally good, with props be credited on the craftsfolk working on Cats who put a ton of work into creating a tangible world, not to mentioned that its physical sets are pretty terrific for the most part, especially those which place an emphasis on the smaller stature of the cats, therefore having them interact with comically oversized objects, regardless on its horrible emphasis on the use of garish digital backdrops and green screen.

But in the end, Cats is considered as one of the worst movie adaptations of a hit musical to be adapted, and probably the very worst ever attempted at this price point and scale. Almost every creative choice on this movie was utterly wrong, the visual design is a ridicule-worthy disaster (also being hilarious for all the wrong reasons), nor doesn't even seem to understand what made the musical so successful in the first place. Furthermore, it's also considered as one of the worst musical films to have been made, next to these terrible musical misfires such as 2004's The Phantom of the Opera, 2009's Nine and 2017's The Greatest Showman. Not to mentioned that Cats is one horrible musical film that brings the musical genre into an all-time low status, as well into a total disgrace and travesty. However, Cats has some potential to become a cult classic in the vein of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, even by conventional filmmaking standard is that Cats is an awful film. Yet, its inherent weirdness will ensure that it still wins its fair share of supporters, and will no doubt be screened on a regular basis on the midnight movie circuits within the next few years. Furthermore, the insane production of this movie will no doubt be talked in years to come (as in the case of bad movies like Jack and Jill, and Batman & Robin) and as horrible as this movie turned out to be, few are likely to forget about it any time soon."
10.0,29 December 2019,"I have never read a more inaccurate series of ratings in my life! The movie Cats was a wonderful movie of a high-quality Broadway or London theater musical. It was not a movie like Star Wars or Aquaman. It wasn't supposed to have a big plot, it was a MUSICAL: song and dance for those of us who can't easily get to New York and London productions (and prefer comfortable seats while watching for those of us who have! 😉) What made it even better was that the cat costumes really moved and close ups of the singers really looked like the singer AND a cat.

Geez, folks! You really need to retract all your low ratings and rate this wonderful production for what it really was!"
7.0,24 April 2021,"1st off, I've never seen the stage play, but all the ONE star reviews are ridiculous. Maybe it doesn't compare to the original, but I was entertained. The actors did as good a job as they could with this material."
10.0,24 August 2020,"Heard nothing but rubbish reviews and seen the rating of 2.8 out of 10. But it was absolutely brilliant! As a huge fan of the original the new did not disappoint, great songs, great outfits, funny, very cheesey but very enjoyable"
6.0,12 October 2020,"Yes, the cats look a bit weird. No, I have never had the chance to see cats as a theathre play, as I do not live in London or the US. Yes, there are weird noises in this movie like the one in the opening scene. Buuut: it has beautiful show numbers, very beautiful singing too. The sests are in a cat view. It def. wasn't horror or unwatchable... It's a movie! They did amazing cgi work with ears and tails and fur. Just give it a chance :)"
8.0,20 December 2019,I absolutely loved this film could watch it over again 😍 Jennifer Hudson's Memories was probably 2nd only to Elaine Paige 😍 Ignore the critics just go & enjoy the film 😍😍
7.0,30 November 2021,"I really don't understand the bad critics that the film has. I haven't seen the musical. However, it seems a film that aspired too much but that is not a bad at all. It has a great cast, the songs are fabulous, except for one song that sounds a bit strange, the rest of the songs are very well interpreted.

The opening part of the film is somewhat slow and boring, but then it improves. Jennifer Hudson's performance is sublime."
10.0,20 December 2019,"A medical doctor who belonged to a local church was asked to join the committee whose job it was to evaluate the pastor. The doctor refused, explaining that no lay people, but only other doctors, are competent to judge a how doctors carry out their profession.

Competence in critiquing one genre does not necessarily mean the critic is competent to critique another. Musicals and science fiction have been areas of specialization of mine for nearly a half century, and I find many critiques of music or science fiction reveal not any defect in the subject, but the incompetence of the critic.

When Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to translate T. S. Eliot's ""Old Possum's Guide to Practical Cats"" into a musical, surely his friends told him he had finally lost his mind (As if ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Evita"" weren't proof enough of that). ""Old Possum's"" is not a story, it's a collection of silly poems about cats, not great literature, but fun to read to little children. There is no plot there, no story. ""Cats"", the resulting musical, is wondrous and magical, not because of the story, but because of the brilliant music, the supernatural dance moves, the scenery, the staging, and the orchestration. Somehow, they added a gossamer framework of a story, having the cats coming up before Old Deuteronomy to see who gets to go to the Heavyside Layer for a new jellicle life. Let's face it, going from cat to cat, poem to poem, is a bit tedious at moments. Personally, I found Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots a bit boring. It feels as if we're enduring those to get to the beautifully satisfying emotional ending.

To translate the play into a movie, Tom Hooper has added another layer of gossamer: Macavity kidnapping (catnapping) other contestants for the prize hoping to have it himself. Having enlisted Judi Dench (Old Deuteronomy), Idris Elba (Macavity), Ian McKellen (Gus), Rebel Wilson (Jennyanydots), and James Corden (Bustopher Jones), he had to expand their parts at least a little. But he has had the advantage of CGI, which he uses brilliantly. I loved the CGI helping turning the characters into cats. It was excellent.

The brilliance of ""Cats"", as I said, is the musical performance, the staging, the dance. Hooper has given us a brilliant musical performance, brilliant staging, and amazing dancing. The story, alas! is inferior. But that's not what I paid to see.

Poor Judi Dench and Ian McKellan! When they're brilliant, I think, ""Ho hum. Brilliant again."" They handled their parts very well.

James Corden is always charming, always worth the price of admission. He is again.

Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift, none of them disappoint.

But Francesca Hayward was a revelation to me. A sweet face, a lovely silvery singing voice, and (to me, an amateur at critiquing dance) some brilliant ballet technique. She carries the movie as the abandoned kitten Victoria, and she carries it well.

Despite my fear of being stoned as a heretic, I daresay Jennifer Hudson was born to play Grizabella, and I would put her rendition of ""Memories"" against anyone's. Who but ""Dreamgirl""'s Effie White could properly render that magnificent number? It has never been done better.

Final word: If you don't like musicals, don't go see ""Cats"". And if you don't like musicals and you go see ""Cats"", don't pass yourself off as a competent critic."
7.0,14 April 2020,"I never got the chance to see this film in the theater. But, when it popped up on pay-per-view, I went ahead and watched it. I enjoyed the original musical on Broadway and figured I would check out its film adaptation. What can I say? It was every much the disaster I had heard it was. It was awkward, disturbing, disjointed. However, the next day, a friend was over and said he hadn't seen it. Since I had it for 48 hours, we went to watch it again. I have to admit, the second time around, it was much more enjoyable. Now that I'm over the extraordinarily weird appearance of the film, I could take in more of the musical numbers and dancing. The dancing is actually extraordinary. It's tragic that the incredibly talented people who put their time and energy into this film had it subverted by bad visuals. I would also argue, that the directing is as bad as people say. Rather than relishing any of the musical numbers and focusing on any of the dancing, the quick cuts and edits are almost nausea-inducing. It's a shame because the dancing is really quite wonderful. The few times you get to really focus on it, you wish you could see more. The bottom line is, watch it more than once. Once you're used to the bizarre look and the indecipherable singing, the second time around there's much more to appreciate."
10.0,27 December 2019,It was cats . It looked like cats and was fun if you liked the musical cats .
6.0,4 January 2020,"A fitting conclusion to the journey from poetry (OLD POSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATS) to musical stage (a la Andrew Lloyd Webber) to the screen. The critics are generally panning it which may be why it isn't getting the box office success it needs to recoup its $90 million budget. But, I liked it. The cast comes from a variety of performance platforms (ballet, pop, theatre, comedy, screened media) but I thought it played well to their respective strengths. Francesca Hayward's skill as a principal dancer, her look and her angelic voice gave a transformative centre for the piece. The dramatic quality of the cast is incontrovertible (Dench, McKellen, Elba). Contrary to the critics, I liked the CGI, thought the story was more enveloping that the book or the musical and can, off the top of my head, think of a host of films that would better qualify as the worst film of 2019. I really thought it was a feast for the senses. I give the film a 7 (good) out of 10, and would happily see it again, which, I guess, elevates it to an 8 according to my rating prerequisites. {Musical Fantasy}"
10.0,16 April 2020,I haven't laughed like that in years. Thank you so much. That ending with Judy Dench... I was in stitches
7.0,2 January 2020,"I was really reluctant to see this film through negative reviews and generally bad reactions across the board. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I think if you've seen the Cats show then you will understand the sporadic and, at times, disjointed narrative and will be rather impressed with the translation to the cinematic screens.

Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memories literally reduced me to tears and I thought the relationship between Mr Mistoflees and Victoria was beautiful to watch.

Expecting too much of a rather bizarre and unique show has lead to the downfall of expectations; not the cast nor the music. Plus - slating a film because the cats have fingers....not a great critique really!"
10.0,29 December 2019,"I believe this is an adaptation from the musical for a reason, and it was a good One. What were people expecting? Only something like ""Les Miserables"" because of who was directing it? Damn, then check better what you want and watch that one instead of spending your time and money on this. It seems that the reviews only help you to acknowledge that you are a little masochistic. I mean, it is an adaptation from the musical which is itself adapted from a book.

If you learn to watch the movie as a standalone item rather than making a comparison, MAYBE, you'll be able to enjoy it."
7.0,2 January 2020,"I must have seen the re-released version because I don't understand all the negative reviews. I enjoyed it and even found myself singing along. I saw the stage show in both New York and London, plus I had the version on VHS. In those the cast played to the audience. In this one they introduced a new cat (Francesca Hayward was wonderful) to play to which I thought a great touch. If I didn't already know the story, I might be lost by it with seemingly random songs. Beautiful Ghosts was a great addition. Although I don't think Dame Judy could hit the deep bass notes which were the signature of Old Deuteronomy. But this wasn't the entire production. I was waiting for The Awful Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles, and it never came. I would have loved to see the cats imitating the dogs as in the stage version. I go to the movies to be entertained, and I was, so yeah, I enjoyed it."
10.0,27 December 2019,"I loved this film. If you are familiar with Old Possums Book of Practical Cats then you will realise that each character that is being introduced is from the text within that book. For those that do not know the characters then I guess it can go over your heads and be a bit bewildering. If you are a fan of the musical and/or dancing then this is a must for you. Steve McRae as Skimbleshanks is as usual brilliant and also Francesca Hayward plus all the supporting dancers.

Jennifer Hudson sings Memories so well that real tears are coming down her face and it moves you (unless you are heartless). My favourite is Magical Mr Mistoffelees. Amazing performance. James Corden, Rebel Wilson, James Derulo, Taylor Swift, Judi Dench. Idris Elba and Ian McKellan are all fabulous.

Just get into the film and think of them as characters from the book and not humans pretending to be cats. This film is for people with imaginations and for those to escape to beautiful dancing and songs. This is not for people who need a plot or storyline as it's a portrayal of characters and nothing more.

I was so worried that the critics would be right but if they spend so much time writing about the lumps and bumps in certain areas that are missing then this says a lot about their minds. If you can't watch a performance without looking for Idris Elba's bits like Mr Peter Bradshaw of the Guardian then perhaps see Star Wars instead.

This film is for people who love musicals, dancing or escapism. If you take a 2 year old and an 8 year old and they get fidgety then of course they will as I don't expect poetry, music and dancing will fulfil them, so have come common sense and see a cartoon instead."
7.0,26 December 2019,"Didn't see the critical reviews until afterwards. Not perfect but a good watch - guess it's a migration of the stageshow, with impressive sets and dancing. Few songs are well known, but that's also true of the hit show isn't it? Knowing little about 'Cats' some things puzzled me. Suggest reading Wikipedia article beforehand. Eg, just what is a Jellicle cat?"
10.0,28 December 2019,"Everything splendid: the songs (mainly ""Memory""). dancing and choreography, the performing, the actors and actresses impersonation and making up and even the story which is a simple one: a group of cats, the jellicles get together every year to chose one of them to go up to the heaviside layer from where they come back to a new jellicle life. This is a plot pretext to entertain us with the mgnificent movie views, images, scenes and sounds. An unlosable movie."
7.0,28 December 2019,"I came expecting to see the worst film of the year based on the buzz out there as did most of the other people in the theater. It starts off slow, but it actually picks up after the first ten minutes or so. I knew that a musical of this nature (a sung through musical) wouldn't be every one's cup of tea. And I knew that the deviations from the stage musical would cause some fans of the stage musical to pan it. And in truth the changes to the choreography were by and large very negative. But while not as good as the original choreography by a long shot, some of this choreography has its moments. I found that as long as I just evaluated it on its own and not in comparison to the original, I could find it enjoyable. Admittedly, I last saw Cats on Broadway over 30 years ago, so it was easier for me to forget how great the original was than some people. I hope I saw the version without the special effects fixed since there were some glaring problems in the version I saw. If this was the fixed version, then oh my god! The individual performances were good. I loved Taylor Swift's turn and Jason Derulo was terrific even if whoever did the special effects neutered him. Francesca Hayward was a standout throughout and Steven McRae's tap dancing was marvelous (he of course is one of the finest ballet dancers in the world, but I didn't know that he could tap dance like that too!). If only the choreography had let some of the other fine dancers shine like he was able to do since the cast was loaded with top notch dancers who would have really shined with something approaching the original choreography. Naoimh Morgan was a great Rumpleteazer and Danny Collins an excellent Mungojerrie. So this really could have been great with better special effects (meaning at least not with glaring errors) and with better choreography. But I enjoyed myself after the slow start and if people who don't mind a sung through musical can forget comparisons with the stage version and just take this on its own, I believe they can find enjoyment here."
10.0,23 December 2019,"In my honest opinion, and I feel a bit alone in this, the Cats movie is an amazing retelling of a truly captivating (and justifiably so) musical spectacle. A lot of the reviews of this movie are unfair in my opinion. Was it strange looking at people CGI'd as walking, talking, singing and dancing cats?? Yes....but no stranger than watching people dressed as cats singing and dancing on a stage. Was the story a little confusing? It would be yes...for somebody who has no idea what the musical is about.

Once again I feel that the opinions of some reviewers of this movie are unfair and not a just reflection as to what was attempted rather successfully with this movie which in reality is a film...based on a successful Broadway show...based on a book...all about singing and dancing cats...who have their own personalities...their own likes and dislikes...kind of like every individual person on the planet...

With all that said however, in my opinion, you cannot have such a massive disliking for something that you do not truly understand.

P.S. This movie was amazing....in my opinion :-)"
7.0,3 January 2020,"I was led to believe it was sort of a big budget plan 9 from outer space, but really, it isn't so bad at all.

You have to accept it for what it is -- an staging of an surreal, episodic musical (it reminds me of Godspell in a way). Some episodes were fabulous, some were just so-so. There's a lot of great dancing and some wonderful singing.

The plot is minimalist, each song is just its own little character piece. And it feels like it's halfway between a streamed version of a broadway show and a full-fledged film adaptation -- some things are augmented, but it's still mostly a bunch of fixed sets. I liked it anyway.

And the CGI wasn't that creepy -- except maybe the cockroaches -- the actors still looked like people in cat suits, just with more tail and ear motion. Even I -- never having seen the musical and knowing only about 8 bars of ""memories"" -- knew there would be people in cat suits.

I don't know why I'm moved to write this review, I liked the film but didn't *love* it. I'm not desperate to watch it multiple times, but I'd be willing to see it again if a friend wanted to go. I guess I'm just shocked by the disconnect between all the horrible stuff I had read before seeing it and how basically ok it was."
10.0,28 December 2019,"I loved the stage version and I loved the movie. Those expecting a movie with people in a story, go someplace else. It was beautifully done and the story was amazing along with the choreography!"
7.0,28 December 2019,Was warned by a friend about this movie but I already had purchased a ticket I thought I'll still go and much to my surprise I quite enjoyed it I suppose I am a true Judy dench fan and I thought she was adorable wrapped up like an old cat enjoyed the dancing the story plot loses the plot but was expecting that as had seen the stage show but like some of the anthem songs I enjoyed
10.0,11 April 2021,Probably the best movie ever created. Just simply a masterpiece.
7.0,24 December 2019,"The only impressive part is the make up. The music, the dance & the storyline.... are just so-so. Didn't get much of my attention. The supporting characters are doing majority of the singing."
10.0,5 October 2020,"Great Acting, Great Songs, Great Dancing and Choreography, Great Spacial Effects, Great Direction by Tom Hooper, Great Cinematography, Great Set and Art Decoration and an Emotional and fantastic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Classic Broadway musical. Cats is a Bizarre and Visually Dazzling Masterpiece. It's film for cats Fans and for the whole family.

I Give Cats (2019) 10/10 Stars. I'm Filmshoot and thanks for reading."
7.0,2 February 2020,"I had the experience of renting a VHS copy of a filmed production of Cats decades ago, and found it pretty unwatchable. The production was done nicely, so maybe I just wasn't in the mood. The television ads for the first run were fascinating, as were television performances promoting it. Then I watched it at 7:40PM, New Years Eve, alone in an auditorium in one of the most popular theaters in Santa Monica, CA. Enough about me. This movie is pure cinema, without the mechanics that make theatrical productions happen. Cuts are very frequent and the camera is everywhere. There are song and dance numbers with special effect mice and cockroaches (the cats find them fascinating but hardly ever kill them). Sir Ian and Dame Judith perform, and Ms. Swift appears to have co-written an additional song with the original composer, which she performs. A story has been added, but the chaos of articulate tails, computer generated London, and a multitude of other elements that only movies have, pretty much dominate. Relax. It is only a movie. Pretty enjoyable. Probably ok for kids."
9.0,18 January 2021,The singing was incredible. Only thing holdig this back is the weird visual style. Cats were in weird spot. They were neither cats or humans.
7.0,3 January 2020,"After planning a trip to see Cats, we sat outside the cinema, reading the reviews on herr, debating whether to go and see something else.....

So glad we went ahead and watched it.

Ok, it's not the deepest film you'll see. Ok, Taylor is only really a cameo. Ok, the CGI effects aren't gonna win an Oscar......but, come on. It's a good romp of a film."
10.0,2 August 2020,I don't understand what people are saying about this movie. I think most 1 stars are from people that don't understand true art. Yea the original musical was better but this was great to.
7.0,24 December 2019,"Suspect people's reaction is driven by their response to the music. Cats is light on story and is mainly a series of monologues as different cats introduce themselves. If you admire the songs you'll like the film. If you don't you'll find your attention drawn to other details like settings (on average good rather than great) and effects (divisive). Film is not a total success but has enough to warrant a viewing. An enjoyable musical, showcasing really skilled dancers and some good enough singing. A handful of standout set pieces. Certainly not the total disaster you'd feared...provided you like the music."
10.0,24 October 2020,I liked it...not sure why it got so many bad reviews. Like the music and dancing...I'd recommend it!!!! 😁
6.0,20 January 2020,"This realy isn't as bad as many has written. The story is what it is. It follows the musical version more or less. Not many words are spoken in the movie, almast everything is sung. Maybe it would have benefited from being converted more from the musical format to film. But the big problem is that humans acting as cats will never lock natural... But for one who loves the musical cats, this is a walk down memory lane and well worth your time ;-)"
10.0,20 December 2019,Taylor Swift was amazing and I loved the songs!! I would recommend you take your entire family.
7.0,31 January 2020,"CATS is an inevitable cult classic to the core. Equal parts Rocky Horror Picture Show, Grease, and Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings - only those restricted by their own close-mindedness will find themselves unable to enjoy it. With the failsafe elements of these classics crossed with a singular structure that is as ""linear"" as it gets, and a visual aesthetic that will never be ""accepted"" or fit into any specific era, the absurdity of this picture is undeniable. I had a grin painted across my face for nearly the entirety of the runtime. In a perfect world, they would give Ian McKellen an Oscar for his performance in this. People will be referencing this movie for decades."
10.0,27 December 2019,"Was in doubt about going to the cinema to see this after such miserable reviews and having fond memories of the original London cast, but was greatly impressed by how faithful to the spirit and musicality of both the stage performances I've seen. Well done to all concerned! I'll definitely be up for a second viewing and maybe even the Blu-ray."
7.0,11 January 2020,"WELL, I wouldn't go that far as to downright chastise or condemn this movie. It's supposed to be a retelling and reimagining of one of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's most famous theatrical masterpieces, which is only second to The Phantom Of The Opera. Personally, I think Tom Hooper did a splendid and fantastic job directing this Broadway-inspired stage play. Yeah, the plot was somewhat bland and distasteful, and lacking punch or finesse. But overall the delivery and performances were outright impressive and phenomenal, and it's all thanks to the star-studded casts with their vocal prowess and creative interpretations. Certainly worth mentioning are Jennifer Hudson ('Dreamgirls') and Rebel Wilson ('Pitch Perfect') - arguably two of the strongest female leads in this extravagant production, who shined and stood out from the rest for their outrageous and precocious singing. So kudos and congrats to all the actors, and thank you Tom for this weird and wonderful blockbuster as well as an artsy piece of entertainment flick we all would simply love to hate...PEACE! ;)"
10.0,23 December 2019,"I SAW THIS MOVIE AS ANTI-STAR WARS CHOICE. They both came out the same day and I'm so over that corporate money making monster franchise.

I gotta admit, when I first walked in the movie and saw the beginning, I was like ""oh boy, wtf did I do?..."" and I was very confused and not understanding a thing. Mind you, I've seen, heard, knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about this play or the history of it by Andrew Lloyd Weber. Growing up, I was never at all exposed to broadway and theatre. Yes, I've visited NY/London but never ever been to a play (I know, sad lol).

Ok, this movie was a whole ROLLER COASTER of emotions! I mean, who doesn't love cats? If you don't like/love cats, go fys. Go home and don't see this and don't continue reading....

You really didn't have to follow along the details of the plot. I didn't get the ""Jellicle"" this and that at all during the movie but that's ok. I believe the film makers had that in mind. When they made this film, they were not only trying to appease the hard-core fans of this play but also expose it to a younger, unaware audience (Gen-Z's & Millenials). An audience that, were it not for the access and the relatability of the movie theater, would never had known about this world of broadway and theatre. Now, because of this film, I'm going to make it a priority to see a broadway show the next time I'm in NY/London/LA because those people really work hard in their performances and you end up appreciating their effort.

This film:


They were all amazing. Bravo to you folks!! I truly hope the Academy Awards nominates you and you win.

As I said, you didn't have to follow along that well the story line because I didn't understand some of the lyrics of the songs but all you had to do was wait for a Cat to show up with a song that you like and YOU'RE HOOKED. Now I understand why so many famous artists and singers signed up for this film. It tells of a beautiful story that I now know the history of and WISH I had known about it before.

I've asked everyone that saw Star Wars ""Did the audience get up and applaud?"". The answer was: yeah, the nerds and the enthusiasts got up and clapped. ""Did people cry and laugh in your film?"" Yeah, they did. Well guess what?....So did the audience in Cats. There were people young and old. Grandmas and grandpas, moms and dads, and children of all ages. Everybody laughed, cried, sniffled, gasped, worried, sang and smiled.

This was a wonderful film. I truly appreciate the work those people did to create this production. It was great. I'm going back to see it a 2nd time in the theater because I was invited the 1st time and I actually wan't to give my own money to support this film lol. Thank you guys! :)"
6.0,14 July 2020,"Not so bad as they say, but nothing compared to the musical. They did Bombalurina so dirty!!!"
10.0,23 December 2019,"Honestly, this film is magical! It's fairly faithful to the stage show but without limitations. It's funny and entertaining. I suspect a lot of people just don't get it. It's weird. IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WEIRD. The cast, whether familiar or not, play their roles superbly. We all loved it!"
6.0,30 May 2020,"Yes if you can get past the shady affects and visuals and yes if you are a fan of the original musical you will enjoy this film!

If you are new to cats by watching this film no doubt you will not understand and be able to compare to the original.

True fans will enjoy this, yes it does have its moments but its alot better than what has been rated."
10.0,30 December 2019,"Cats The Movie was impeccably fine 👌🏼 The fantasy of the world, the talent of the actors and dancers, the effort and authenticity was superb. I had no issue with the CGI fur as they were humans playing cats. It was cool because it was as if we were watching an on stage production but the actors transformed into cats. I read people complaining saying ""I shouldn't have to question wether the actor is a man or a woman ... um okay well... male cats and female cats alike are both sultry, mysterious, curious and pretty smooth. I think that society was taken back by the film because it is so different than anything done before on a theater screen. The plot was spot on. As cats have 9 lives and don't have the misfortune of suicide it was an humbling look at what a fantasy world where moving on and being reborn is a desirable goal. Overall the movie was charming, Francesca, the lead ballerina from the Royal Ballet was astounding in her role. The amount of talent in this film in inspiring. The ballads, the set, the choreography... I give cats a 10/10. The hatful reviews are true to the ones writing it but many people don't remember that this is an on stage musical that had been adapted to the big screen. If you left the film early, are avoiding it because of others opinions or are just unfamiliar with creative mastery coming to cinema, then I suggest you give it a second go 👍🏼"
6.0,29 July 2024,"I was reading all those negative critics and finally saw the film for myself. My opinion abut the film Cats is quite different. I like the movie Cats and its beautiful costumes, scenery and how actresses and actors move like real cats do. I don't understand why film has so bad reputation and poor critics. For me it was amazing experience and feast for eyes. Cats is not the best film I saw neather, but a good one. My rating is 6/10. Hope time will work for it. For example the Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens was a bad film and was praised from many. Majority is not always right in their opinion, so watch Cats for yourself and bring your own conclusions."
8.0,31 December 2019,"Despite the negative reviews and attacks from the internet hive mind, I went to see this anyway. I enjoy most musicals, and I'd enjoyed seeing the stage production of Cats when I saw it as a teenager. I absolutely loved it. Sure, the human-cat hybrid CGI was a bit weird at first, but I got used to it by the end of the first song. The plot is light, but this is a movie you go see for the artistry, dancing, and music rather than the story. It was simply FUN. Highlights were Ian McKellan's Gus, and the Skimbleshanks song.

If you like musicals, or if you were thinking of seeing it before the haters jumped on the hate bandwagon, go see it and decide for yourself. You just may end up loving it."
7.0,4 September 2022,"The ratings do not do justice to the individual performances. Jennifer Hudson's performance brought me to tears. Francesca Haywood's performance was beautiful. The expressions and movements of all the cast were well done. Loved the other performances of Robert Fairchild, Laurie Davidson, Steven McRae, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift. I thought that they portrayed their characters really well. Unfortunately the show as a whole was not that captivating but I did enjoy and appreciate the individual performances. I thought that the costuming and CGI effects were well-done to enhance the characterizations."
8.0,5 January 2020,"Before you see this, you should ask yourself how much you actually like musicals and how much you understand the concept of this musical. I personally thought it was enjoyable and fun. James Corden and Taylor swift are brilliant and it's funny. People in the cinema laughed at the right places and no one walked out. I don't understand why people don't like it!! Jennifer Hudson sings 'memory' amazingly. I think you have to be the 'right' person to see it to be honest."
6.0,31 December 2019,"I saw the IMDb score and some reviews before heading into the theater for the new ""Cats"". I had great hope while I know Tom Hooper is directing this great musical, as he did an absolutely amazing job for ""Les Miserables"". Therefore I was so shocked that the score for this movie is way lower than I expected which I started to think is this really the ""Cats"" or another type of ""Scary Movie"" which we all know it sucks terribly. Screw it! I ignore all those critics and scores like I previously do for all movies. And I must say you all should give some credit to this movie. I must admit the CG in the movies sucks terribly, totally ruin the whole movie, which I will score 0 on this category. And 0 for the ending part which makes absolutely no sense. And 0 for Taylor Swift even I was a fan for Taylor before. For choice of characters, it is alright... except Ian Mckellen who can't say nor express the real emotions of the role. Which I related to Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia somehow. But I do think the movie is directed in a way which allows audience to immerse themselves step by step, cat by cat. And I am so touched by the part where they sang ""Mr Mistofelees"". Real emotions, real touching. And followed by the re-entrance of Jennifer Hudson. That's why I rate it for a 6."
9.0,20 December 2019,"In a world of cinema where 80%of films are remaks of remakes this is a breath of fresh air. So many bad reviews, i really cant see why. Cats is a musical its singing and dancing. You either like musicals and theatre or you dont. Good cast, good acting, little scenery so the acting really is the forfront of the film. A lovely film filled with classic songs of Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber. Bear it in mind that alot of the cast are Not actors but dancers, and yes theres a few CGI hickups but even the best films have these."
7.0,26 December 2019,"Like most crappy movies, attack of the killer tomatoes, plan 9, manos the hands of fate...cats is right up with awfully bad movies.

Expect the train wreck of a movie with a chorus line of dancing cockroaches and you wont be disappointed"
9.0,25 December 2019,"Look! All you who 'Nay Say' this have not really understood this... It's a series of poems, set to music and dance, by Andrew Lloyd-Webber. It's a fantastic, and fantastical, journey through one night of a 'gang'... tribe if you will, of street creatures. If this was filmed along the lines of 'West Side Story'... It would be a box office smash. A gang of youths who want to send one of their ailing kind to the otherworld.... Good Lord! Just what would the Marvel and DC world make of that? Blood? Guts? Angst? Violence? Abuse? Abusive language? This has NONE of that! It's a fabulous romp through one night where there is an evil villain (McCafferty) and a beautiful heroine (Victoria) are butting heads (Many a true word there!) with the rest of the gang. There is a... Sensei?... Spiritual leader, if you must, who will choose who is to pass on to 'The Heavyside Layer'. There is Magic! Spiritualism! Evil! Good! Love! And a fantastic musical score and songs. PLUS... As an added bonus, a sparkling brand new song written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Taylor Swift. It's heartachingly beautiful... The dance routines are exquisite! Even Idris Elba gets in on the act... He's surprisingly good! I will not spoil the rest of this gorgeous, exquisite, fun, happy and, above all, feel good film for you. Just go to see it. Open up your minds and eyes. Get immersed. But just remember... The original poems were written back in the 1930's by T.S. Elliot, someone not known for his adherence to convention. Just hook your belief into the film within the first few minutes and enjoy it as a magnificent musical journey and romp. Enjoy the sounds, the songs, the awesome costumes (even though some find them a little weird and disturbing at first). But most of all, just enjoy the absolute SPECTACLE of the film. It's beyond superb! Slander me if you will, but this is my opinion, see it and tell me just what it is you think of it. Regards to you all!"
6.0,26 March 2020,"I have never seen the theatre version so I went into it blind. I honestly don't know why so man people disliked it, sure they look a little weird, but besides that, it's a decent movie. I really liked the songs, and the cast could sing. I guess I have to watch the theatre version and compare them to try and understand where all the hates coming from."
10.0,21 December 2019,It was an experience unlike I've ever had before. This is the new standard for cinema and I want more of movies with people acting like animals.

9.0,22 December 2019,"Admittedly the visual of a human as a cat is odd at first, once over that a great film was amazing music"
7.0,13 December 2022,"Cats is an odd musical. Fantastic music, songs, and dances with a shoe-horned in story tying things together. Making a film of it was never going to be easy, and making it for people who want a clear story would be near impossible. But the music, songs and dances are still there along with some great sets.

Things I liked, on top of the obvious songs:
Francesca Hayward is brilliant as the reworked Victoria.


The sets, overall, look great.






I could go on, tbh, because there's a lot to like.

Things I didn't like...








Anyway, my daughters love it and watch it regularly. Like anyone sensible, they ignore the story and dance around the room singing the wonderful songs."
9.0,20 December 2019,"I really enjoyed the movie, the choreography and the musical arrangement of the songs is amazing, just as I would expect in a musical and more. I heard some complain about the cgi but in the play, they wear cat costumes and I can't see any better way they could have done the cgi. I am a dog person and after watching this, I would want to adopt a cat. Overall, it is what I expected in a musical and more"
7.0,28 December 2019,
9.0,24 December 2019,"This movie is exactly what you would expect from an adaptation of a stage musical. If you don't like musical theatre and you don't like the stage production of Cats then why go and see it in the first place and why take the time to write a negative review. Yes they are Cats singing and dancing around but the title of the show should give you a clue. To call it ""weird"" is to show you have no idea what you are going to in the first place. It's an excellent and faithful adaptation and is fun for all the family. Go and see it and judge for yourself"
7.0,29 June 2020,"A film of a play produced as a stage production is very difficult to make. This was well done. I never saw the play, but I truly enjoyed this film production. I have delayed seeing it because of all of the negative reviews and constant derision from media. But I wish I had not listened because this was fun to watch. Idris Elba is fantastic, in everything he does but here particularly. Dame Dench is always tops! But Jennifer Hudson is mind blowingly good. All the rest of the cast is great as well not one performer brought shame onto the production, they performed magnificent numbers and the scenes were so cool. Hats off to you all, and kudos on a great piece of entertainment."
9.0,23 December 2019,"What they Don't Want you to know is that there is a positive message. What they don't want you to know is that the black entertainers SLEIGH their performances. A FEW VOCALS were amazing by Hudson & Derulo. What they don't want you to know is that this is a beautiful showcase of talent! I knew something was suspicious when all the critics were going in so fast on how ""horrible"" this movie was. It actually was very good. This was far from Glitter."
7.0,29 December 2019,I'm not sure why everyone has been so negative about this movie. It's always going to be creepy when you try turning humans into cats-cgi or not. The music and performance was overall phenomenal aside from (sadly) James Corden and Rebel Wilson's parts. For those people who say there's no plot I ask what were you expecting? Have you seen the Broadway show of this before? I thought it was delightful and the music was sensational just like the original musical it's based off of!
9.0,20 March 2020,Did I not watch the same Cats that everyone one else hated? I found it to be fun and a great update from the original. I cried my eyes out at the end and loved the storyline they used to have everything make sense.
7.0,24 December 2019,The music in this is amazing! Can't fault it at all! The dancing in this is stunning as well! But the storyline and the costumes are different. Found myself a bit bored at times. If you can get past the humans as cats then you might enjoy it. Think I'll need to watch this a few times. Vanessa the main cat is a beautiful dancer and singer and carries the film. And the actress who sung memories has a beautiful voice!
10.0,10 March 2020,"Personally, I think most of the people giving this movie a bad review are lying through their teeth. Some Broadway snob came out against the movie, so now most people are being asses and refusing to tell their true feelings on it, afraid people will think badly of them. The only thing bad about this movie was Taylor Swift, and her padded suit, but then again, she's just a disaster no matter what she does."
7.0,28 December 2019,"Only if you like musicals, if you like magical stories, if you are open minded but if you are, you will enjoy it! I did! I was sucked in into that cats fairy tale and I was so moved I even cried at the end. Wow.... Such a spectacular production. Amazing special effects, every detail to perfection. I am absolutely delighted that I didn't listen to the poor reviews.... I am totally impressed and happy that I have watched that movie. If you musicals fan please go and see it! You will not be disappointed!"
9.0,25 June 2020,"Please do your research before you complain about a movie you didn't expect. This is based on the 1970s musical Cats which had fantastic dancing and music built around the story and beliefs of a group of Cats (based around TS Elliott's poems). Its is about rebirth, the importance of community and the pain of loneliness and loss. Yes this has a small amount of CGI that is weird because this is first and foremost a dance musical as the human body can do amazing things. The CGI moves were unexpected. But watching Victoria dance ballet was exquisite.

Loved this more than I loved my old VHS of CATS. They gave it more of a story. They used famous people in very appropriate roles. Seriously, if you the musical, this one is well worth seeing. I would normally give it 7 or 8 stars because the intermittent CGI moves were unnecessary, but this movie captivated me. Having fell for the pathetic reviews, I rented this planning to listen to it in the background, but ended up sitting and watching it, entranced.

When they announced they were doing this movie, I was surprised as I didn't think it would suit the ADD audience of today. I am sad to note that I was right. The movie isn't the problem, but the cookie-cutter tastes of today's audience is."
7.0,25 December 2019,"I had always heard 3 things about the 'Broadway Musical Production' called ""CATS"". 1 - That there was this Amazing Broadway Musical Production called Cats. 2 - That the Incredibly Famous ICONIC Musical Number ""Memories"" was from That Broadway Musical Production. 3 - (Lastly) Had Heard that Many Parents would Not Allow their Kids to See 'THIS' Particular Broadway Musical Production!! (Never Knew Why Though!!) (Still Don't Know Why!!)

So Naturally, This was DEFINITELY on my Bucket List to Watch (i.e..The Musical!!) So Lemme tell you How Overjoyed I was to Learn, that there was a Musical Film based on the Incredible Broadway Musical Production being made!!!

I watched it just Yesterday (here in Canada), and from the First few minutes, I was HOOKED!!!! From the Infectious Main Score of the Opening Number, to us, the audience, seeing all the characters introduce themselves in their own unique way, to the Attention Grabbing Songs and Wonderfully Choreographed Routines. The Other Cast Members Performances were Wonderful, But Jennifer Hudson's Performance Forcefully REMINDS us..""WHY"" She's Won an Oscar, Grammy, Bafta & SAG Award!!! Her Performance was Extremely Captivating, Mesmerizing and Heart-Felt!! Overall EXQUISITE!!! Andrew Lloyd Webber is a Mad Genius when it comes to Song-Writing & Storytelling!!!

I Still Don't Understand 2 Things... 1 - Why Parents Don't Allow their Children to see This Play with them and 2 - How on EARTH does this Amazing Musical Film Only Have a Rating of 2?????? I'm Bewildered!!!!"
10.0,18 April 2020,"Started a little slow, but once the music and dancing kicked in it was super enjoyable."
7.0,24 December 2019,"Reading all the online reviews, you might think Cats is a terrible movie. It isn't.

I'm a fan of the musical, so I was looking forward to this adaptation for the big screen. I haven't been disappointed.

First of all, the main problem with the musical is that it completely lacks a plot. Not much of a problem on stage, but it would have been on screen. An extra storyline was invented (Victoria) and that really helped in giving the scenes some coherence. Most scenes were quite nice, with London as a background for the singing and dancing. Especially Skimbleshanks on one of London's railway bridges was a great scene. The dancing was quite alright, although the special effects (the cat leaping) were below par.

The main problem - and in that some of the negative reviews are quite right - is the choice of actors. Robbie Fairchild and Francesca Hayward were great, but this movie would have been a lot better without all the famous actors. James Corden can sing and act, but he made his character Bustopher Jones into a James Cordon-character. Rebel Wilson was just plain annoying. Judi Dench and Ian McKellen are great actors - in this movie as well, but shouldn't have been casted in a musical. Especially Dench brought some awkward singing and it's hard to imagine she was the best choice for this role. Of all the big stars involved, only Taylor Swift managed to do some good singing and dancing without turning her Cat-character into an extension of herself.

The choices of actors lead to some annoying moments, but overall Cats was a nice movie. Not great, but definitely not as bad as some have you believe."
10.0,2 January 2020,"After reading reviews and looking at the reviewer's scores I expected the worst. Comments around poor CGI, poor story and in some cases poor singing are common in reviews and after almost not seeing this movie I decided to take the chance. The actual movie was very good. The CGI was good and I did not feel anything was weird. The lacks of clothes and the suggestion of breasts on the female cats were hardly noticed and I wonder what the motive of the comments actually was. The story was clearer than the stage play and the music was excellent. Anyone who liked the stage play will enjoy this movie. If you don't like musicals and did not enjoy the stage play, then this movie is not for you. I would also suggest it may not appeal to younger viewers, although I could be wrong here."
7.0,30 December 2019,"A guide to the movie Cats:

-If you need a guide then this movie is not going to be the right choice for you. -You may want to have a cat or like cats. -If you did not have a chance to see the fourth longest running Broadway musical of all time...again this movie is not going to be the right choice for you. -If you want to embrace the film (good or bad) with a group of your most awesome friends then by all means sacrifice the 110 minutes. -You may want to grasp the concept of a character study beforehand. Have you seen The Breakfast Club? That was a character study. A character study is not a plot or a story and if you expect either one then you are going to be sad.

Now...if you have read T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats and/or seen the fourth longest running musical in Broadway history then it's going to be a real treat for you to see Dame Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy, Sir Ian McKellen as Gus the Theater Cat and Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella and it's going to be because (just like the Broadway show) they don't dance.

You still get all of the same songs that you love and it will be cute to see the actors you do know as the rest of the cast. Except for what they had to do with Macavity in order for that character to make sense on screen. That was a little weird.

Sadly, the dancing and even the movement is completely lost and replaced with CGI weirdness, which is a huge part of why people loved it on the stage.

At the end of the day cats are still going to win. All things feline and the billions of dollars associated with them will always be worth more than your space fantasy franchise, your comicon and your superhero movies. Sorry Jason Momoa if it's between you and Grumpy Cat, he's going to get more views than you ever will and he died last year.

When you're done scrolling through this little review along with the hundreds of cat videos, memes and photos in your newsfeed you don't have to admit it out loud."
10.0,27 December 2019,"I walked into this movie knowing it would be strange and odd- I also walked in wanting to like it! I mean - I spent money on it. With this mindset, I LOVED IT. My partner doesn't usually last a movie in the cinemas without needing to pee- but he held it in for this one. The soundtrack was beautiful and amazing. I was amazed, confused and somewhat scared- but that's what 'cats' is!!!! It's art. If you can't appreciate the artistic design, incredible soundtrack, intricate detailing on every single cat- then who are you!! This movie is highly underrated and I think it's becoming a trend. - which is wrong. Nobody is appreciating the effort put into this one. And I feel bad for the actors. It's similar to cancelling James charles- nobody knows the context but they just join in. And I think critics are too.

I loved this movie - give it a go. Read about ""cats"" before you see it. It's not a new story- it's a re-make."
7.0,2 January 2020,"I went along because of the bad reviews and also having memories of the bad singing when seeing the musical in the 1980's. Best things were Judi Dench, T S Eliot's poetry, Jennifer Hudson and Rebel Wilson. Bad things were the slow pace and the doubling of all the musical numbers making it really tedious. Plus if you didn't know the musical you wouldn't have a clue as to what was going on. I also really liked Victoria."
10.0,23 December 2019,"This movie is so wonderful! I am gob-smacked by all the negative reviews and I have to suspect there is a campaign to down-vote this film. It is a joy to watch. It's 200 times better than seeing it on stage. The cast is 100% gold. And the performances are ALL very special, especially Judi Dench and Jennifer Hudson. In my theater everyone adored it, and there were audible sobs everywhere when JHud sang Memory. I can't imagine anyone giving it less than 9 stars. Everyone I know loved it and can't wait to go see it again."
6.0,29 August 2022,"As I was watching Cats, my daughter came in and said ""it's not very good, we don't like it""...I asked if she'd seen it. She said not. I decided to make my own mind up.

Don't get me wrong, the half-cat half-human hybrids take some getting used to but I enjoy Syfi so...well not a problem. I'm also a massive cat lover...he's called Butterscotch.

I really liked Judy Denche's performance, although there is a speech/song that should have been cut. The role is more believable as a female. Laurie Davidson did a believable job as Mr Mistopholees.

James Cordon is great, in his role providing the only laugh in the film. The performance of memories did nothing for me...sorry. It may have brought the crew to tears but not for me. The vocal range & interpretation just wasn't there.

Francesca Hayward's performance of Victoria was suitably gauche and the hinted romance between Victoria & Mr Mistopholees was cute.

They didn't deal with Victoria being abandoned except later in song, but hey it's a portrayal of a cat.

I was left with the impression that it is the source material that is the issue. I watched the stage production after....it's boring. This may have been a case of the Lloyd Webber's name selling a substandard musical. How it lasted 20 years on the west end is beyond me. Maybe it's the two good songs in it? Memories is beautiful and. Magical Mr Mistopholees is catchy. I guess I'm the child saying the emperor doesn't have any clothes. The songs are mostly poor. It's dated.

The film was more interesting, so yes it was that bad. This was a film, well actually a musical that should never have been made."
10.0,27 January 2020,"This movie for sure changed my perspectives on so many things. The story line moved along so well and every part of its plot was concrete. Every character was made to okay this role. No lie.

It was all very jellicle. Jellicle jellicle jellicle. Wanna see a good film....? Then jellicle."
7.0,21 March 2020,"CATS is, in no uncertain terms, unusual. Not just this movie, mind you; the whole concept of the stories of cats told through TS Eliot's poetry. The original stage show had very little plot, and the original poems of course have none.

This movie should appeal mostly to fans of the original musical. Unfortunately, whoever designed the trailers seemed to be trying to draw in non-musical fans; as a result, many are kept away by a criminally bad trailer.

The story is set in motion by the tragic arrival of Victoria; a dancer in the original, here she functions as the audience surrogate, and later in the story takes on the duties originally given to Jemima in the stage play. The opening number starts in a beautiful approximation of the original play's junkyard.

No review if this film can avoid talk of the CGI. I did not feel the ""uncanny valley"" issues so many complained about (but I saw the home video version which may be fixed up). The animated ears are a nice touch and really add character. The tails I'm not so sure about. I'd personally have preferred somewhere halfway between the stage makeup/costumes and what we have here. Where the animation wa disconcerting is in any jumps or acrobatic moves. Most video games have better looking jumps than these; it's like the animators have never seen either a cat or a dancer leap, and thus we get these graceless aerobatics that yank you out of your immersion.

The movie takes many liberties with the source material; Jennyanydots and Bustopher Jones are robbed of all their dignity by Rebel Wilson and James Corden's slapstick. An odd choice was to have many of the characters sing their own songs when originally they were sung by other cats about them, which makes many of the asides in them make no sense at all. This is most noticeable in Gus the Theatre Cat, and having Gus and Jennyanydots do their own songs reduces poor Jellylorum to a silent background part. And Bombalurina, normally a major part in several songs, is reduced to a brief cameo by Taylor Swift.

But the show itself still put me through an emotional wringer. Jennifer Hudson absolutely slays ""Memory"" (normally my least favorite song in the show), and Victoria's new song ""Beautiful Ghosts"" is effective and heartrending.

If you are a fan of the original material, please give this version of Cats a try. If you are not, this version won't make you one."
10.0,27 December 2019,I've never felt the genuine desperation to gorge my eyes out until i watched this. i've never felt so scared and intimidated by a movie. this was scarier than annabelle itself.
7.0,31 December 2019,The movie wasn't THAT bad. Y'all just mean. Like if you just imagine them as dancers in fuzzy leotards it's a lot better.
10.0,28 December 2019,"I can't believe how bad the reviews have been for this film? If you love singing and dancing you'll love this. It's feel good, the songs and dancing are great. Jennifer Hudson is spectacular with her voice. I would see it again and again. People need to lighten up and stop using their energy on being negative."
7.0,4 January 2020,Too many big stars had short appearances. Never saw the play so I can't compare the differences. I enjoyed the music and the CGI. It's not for everyone but it was good for me.
10.0,21 December 2019,"If people are slamming this film, all I can say is that they do not see the skill and artistry that has gone into it. The costumes are amazing, the dancing is great, the characters of the various named cats and the movement of all the cats and creatures is very clever. The music is fabulous as always. Clearly there are just not enough whopping great special effects in this film for some people! I say, really well done to all involved."
7.0,4 January 2020,"Never seeing the stage show of Cats I figured seeing this could give me a chance to see why it became such a phenomenon as a stage show. I also love seeing movies that are hyped and then get low views. So after seeing the movie even in spite of the negative reviews, I've concluded the negative reviews have a problem with the uncanny valley and can't get past it to enjoy the movie. They are now simply dog piling their negative reviews onto it because everyone else is.

There is no immediate story, this is a chance to just hang out with cats as we follow nice to look at newcomer Francesca Hayward's cat version as she is tossed from a car into a new neighborhood full of Jellicle cats (and some mice) who she gets to meet.

As a fan of The Rocky Horror Picture Show 10/10, Moulin Rouge (10/10 visuals/costumes 7/10 everything else), The Sound of Music (7.5/10), this is not bad - I'll give it a 6. As I was watching I couldn't help but think if they had simply gone with the spandex costumes from the theater instead of CGI, it would have been easier on the eyes and not make them look demonic. Rebel Wilson and James Gordon aren't bad, but I would have used real actors and tighten up the story/lessen the length of songs instead rather using than celebrities because if you hate those celebs, you hate spending time with their characters. They were there for the funny, but it was uneven to the rest of the film.

45 mins into the movie a story still was not presented and I was getting agitated. It was just one cat being introduced after another with a song. Then even after a new cat is introduced, that cat disappears and never lends anything to the story. I understand, you want to submerge the audience into the world but after 45min, lay a story to follow! But no story came, just dance and song after dance and song. After 1 hour I wanted to go home. After 1 hour 15 min, I started squirming in my chair, after 1 hour 30 min, please make it stop.

6 / 10"
10.0,23 December 2019,I am Holly age 8 and you guys put one star (well most of you) for all the hard work and effort the actors and actresses put in to that movie. Dancing10/10. Singing 10/10. Acting 10/10. All I can say is WOW WOW WOW (not bow wow wow). It was purrrfect and dog lovers will LOVE it too
7.0,8 January 2020,"Aside from the unnerving visuals, there is an entertaining story that you can waste a couple hours of your life watching. The film wasn't exactly good but the music was good and overall it is not horrible. I say give the film a chance at least"
8.0,28 December 2019,... only watched it because of the negative reviews. Wasn't that bad ...
7.0,6 January 2020,"Cats is based upon a Broadway musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber which has no plot, and never intended to have one. It is a revue. If you expect something more from it, you will be sadly mistaken. For those not familiar with the concept, a revue is, and I quote, ""a light theatrical entertainment consisting of a series of short sketches, songs, and dances."" So it has *no plot.* If you are expecting some deep story, you will be sadly mistaken.

It is based on some cute poems that poet TS Elliot wrote for his godchildren in letters during the 1930s. They are whimsical and were collected together into a published work as Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. Each poem told a tale for children about a certain cat or cats. So Andrew Lloyd Weber set these to music in his hummable but derivative style and made a theatrical piece out of it, using the childlike poetry to be an excuse to have some majorly impressive dancing. Hate Cats or not, you have to respect the athleticism and skill in the dancing.

The film version feels it is necessary to attempt to create a thin bit of plot around a revue. This doesn't really work, because as I've already said, there is none. The last line of the film is pointless and almost makes you roll your eyes. I used to love the musical as a child before I discovered things that actually had something deeper than light entertainment. However, I did enjoy it at the time, and the music is still entertaining. So I can view this film for what it is: mindless entertainment. West Side Story this is not.

The film version works somewhat, and doesn't for the rest. The character Victoria is used as the audience's foil, taking us into the world of Jellicle cats, and attempting to explain why different cats have songs sung about them or sing about themselves. CGI sets are used, and sometimes overused, to match the particular cat. The original show was a one set in a junkyard, with charming oversized fishbones and assorted trash. Instead, we are mainly around Russell Square in London in the film.

This film has limited dancing compared to the show it is adapting, which is a shame. The Jenny-Any-Dots number with Rebel Wilson is especially disappointing, as this was a wonderful tap number on stage, and now is CGI fest with cockroaches and mice, with Rebel bouncing around a little. Some character development was attempted, especially in the Magical Mister Mistoffelees number, but it's rather ineffective. A looming presence of Macavity is spread throughout the film to attempt to have a bit of tension. It is somewhat effective. One of the most boring songs in all of musical theatre, ""Moments of Happiness,"" is thankfully cut to about 30 seconds. The rousing ""Growltiger's Last Stand,"" is sadly cut to a few measures, but the racist line in it that may have been ok in 1930, but is absolutely unacceptable in 2020, makes the decision somewhat understandable.

It's a delight to see Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen, though they are obviously not singers. Judi plays a male part, by a large man in a shaggy dog like costume. Her different take works fine. They do the best they can. When there is dancing in Cats, it sometimes works well. The Skimbleshanks number adds some much need energy to the dumbed down choreography in other numbers. Jennifer Hudson plays Grizabella, with the popular number that makes Cats famous, ""Memory."" Overall she does well, but I don't get the shots of her with mucus coming out of her nose. Surely she can act without these particular bodily fluids?

Rebel Wilson and James Corden do ok with their parts, though the director chose to cut away in the middle of some songs to give them obligatory ""funny comments"" that don't really work. It's a frustrating decision, but that's just my opinion. Since I'm so familiar with the source material, it could be that I am unable to see this different take without prejudice.

Even so, it was overall enjoyable. It will never stand up to the original stage show, but it did have me going back to Youtube to remember younger days, enjoying the original show and its choreography. I enjoyed seeing it enough once. I don't think it would see it again. It's not great, and it's not perfect, but if you can see it for what it is, it's an ok way to kill two hours."
10.0,26 December 2019,Sadly probably only suitable for true lovers of the musical. Dont't criticize the plot (or the lack of it) if you didn't get it in the theater version or if you not even know what T. S. Elliot wrote.
6.0,3 January 2020,"I watched Cats two days ago and I have since spent some time reflecting on the movie. I think I'm ready to give it my own personal review. It would easy to fall into the trap of making some cat puns and calling it ""uncanny valley"" and just leaving it at that but I want to give it an honest review, even if it goes somewhat against the popular critical opinion.

To start, the elephant in the room needs to be addressed, that there is no doubt that the CGI of the movie is its weakest element. The opening scenes of the movie in particular are something out of a nightmare fever dream but after those scenes to some degree you do get used to it. The shock of seeing a human with CGI fur wears off to an extent. However there is still many moment within the film where some particular movement or camera angle gives you a shiver up your spine and the distinct feeling of 'wrongness'. That being said, the CGI of the cats has nothing on the mice (fat, 'cute' CGI rodents, played by children) which were downright unsettling to watch. The cockroaches with human faces were also disturbing but fortunately only feature briefly in the movie. Tom Hooper's choice of giving some cats various pieces of clothing was also jarring. Just as you're getting used to the CGI fur, a cat will unsettlingly bust out a sequin dress or start break dancing wearing nothing but sneakers.

In terms of their performance, the actors themselves do an excellent job of portraying their characters. Unfortunately this means I will never rid myself of the image of Ian McKellen lapping water from a bowl and licking his paws. There was a number of slapstick comedy moments peppered throughout the movie which I felt fell flat, I don't find it funny when I'm told ""laugh at the fat person doing the dumb thing!"", I think they could've made it more comedic by being more subtle.

The lead actress Francesca Hayward's ballet background shone through well and was very enjoyable to watch. Extending from that, I genuinely enjoyed the choreography throughout the movie. My only criticism is that at times the CGI got in the way of the dancing and it became difficult to tell what was human talent and what was just computer generated.

When I first saw the trailer and saw Tom Hooper was directing, I was looking forward to the score. The music certainly didn't let me down, with a fresh touch on all of the classic Cats songs. In particular the harmonies of Old Deuteronomy were a joyous thing to listen to, a stark comparison to the musical version which I considered downright boring. Taylor Swift's contribution, 'Beautiful Ghosts', fit in well with the tone of the film and was one of the strongest songs. I was only disappointed by Memory, which I felt was sung over dramatically. Don't get me wrong, it's supposed to be an emotional song but Jennifer Hudson sounded like she was barely choking it out through all the tears. There's a beautiful song in there buried under the singers snot covered face and so much vibrato I thought she was singing it through a desk fan set to high.

Overall the tone of the movie and the way it's presented is very much true to the source material. If you've watched the musical version of Cats and a trailer for the movie (to give a taste of the CGI) I think you would be fairly comfortable in knowing what you're in for. There was some moments and musical items which dragged on and ruined the pacing of the movie to a degree. And unfortunately the closing number, 'The Ad-dressing Of Cats' is a weak way to end the film, I think they should've have thrown in something extra in at the end to make it end on a bang, but that's just personal preference.

A lot of the movie critic reviews I've read do nothing but drag the movie through the mud from beginning to end, but I wonder if that's because these critics went in with no prior knowledge of Cats, other than knowing it to be a popular Broadway musical. I'd be interested to see what theatre critics have to say about it, as it truly felt more like a theatre performance than a movie. In summary I feel the CGI deserves a lot of the hate it has received however I walked out of the cinema thoroughly entertained and would likely watch the movie again in the future."
8.0,26 December 2019,"Never seen the musical. No expectations one way or other. I thought it was fun. Critics (professional or recreational) need to reprioritise some of their life choices as they seem to be wasting a lot of positive energy in the creation of negativity. Is it weird? Probably. Is it a heinous crime against all things cinematic and correct. No, it's fun and like watching a theatrical musical at the cinema. Go figure. Good cast. Committed performances. My kids enjoyed it and, although I generally avoid Lloyd Webber musicals, I tapped my toes, smiled and wondered if the world just needs a little more love and fewer critics."
7.0,19 September 2020,"If this is the worst movie you've seen, you need to watch more movies."
9.0,26 December 2019,"I went to see this movie with my mum, sister & aunt and we all loved it! I find it really sad that it's getting such bad reviews and have come to the conclusion that many of the people have either never seen the west end show or it wasn't their cup of tea when they did but still went to the movie. I loved the west end show. I understand the concept of the Jelicle cats and that this is not your typical story told the way the masses expect. If people think them looking like cats is creepy - did you even see the stage show - it's the same! Best bits: Victoria the abandoned kitten linking the scenes between each cat character was beautiful & a lovely dancer, the tap dancing Skimbleshanks & Jennifer Hudson belting out Memories was an amazing performance. I even liked the new song from Taylor Swift called Beautiful Ghosts. Will be seeing it again - so there critics!"
7.0,3 January 2020,"I enjoyed it as a manifestation of the theatre show in an experimental format on-screen. Its kind of like a giant music video. No one takes music videos that seriously and many music videos (Peter Gabriel's ""Sledgehammer"" for one) are interesting and memorable and ultimately about the music. This movie is a series of character vignettes and the music is really what it's all about. The character ""Victoria"" was, for me, beautiful and entrancing to behold.

I feel the noses should have been cat noses but perhaps it might have offset the balance of the ""it's just people in CGI costumes"" motif too much.

Anyhow, don't watch this with expectations of it being a formulaic movie. It's art. An experiment. A string of music videos about cats introducing themselves.

Yes, it's ridiculous.

No, it probably shouldn't have been presented as a regular movie experience because the expectations for a common movie are different.

The songs remained in my head even if the movie was, like most music videos, unique, trying hard and fleetingly entertaining.

It's not a great story. It's not a good movie, really.

But it is art, and it is an experience. Make up your own mind.

See it without the lenses of a moviegoer but of a visitor who is gazing at some crazy-ass art on the wall of a crazy-ass art museum... you may just enjoy it, in that context."
10.0,5 January 2020,"I have been excited about this motion picture from the first official announcement. I also knew from the start that people were not going to give this film a chance. I am indeed a fan of the musical, which also seems to take a lot of unnecessary criticism. Lovers of the play complained the tails didn't move, in the film they do and it now it is so disgusting, I mean they are damned if they do and damned if they don't.

I say stop hating on it, and appreciate the talent and passion that went into this film. The digital fur is amazing if you look at it like the fullest potential the stage makeup and THE SET! I want you to pause for a second and remember the set isn't all green screen but that is a physical set! It makes the film feel that much more amazing and whimsical.

Last and not least the performances of nearly everyone give each jellicle a whole new level of depth and personality. It you don't tear up at least one time I will be amazed, At the end of the day I say go and see this film. The amount of effort, talent and love that went into this film should not be ignored just because it has become trendy to rag on it.

See for yourself and journey to the heavy side layer. You won't be disappointed."
7.0,20 January 2020,"Goodness me such unkind and overly negative reviews of this film. I quite enjoyed it. Not as enjoyable as the stage play but nonetheless enjoyable. All the songs were familiar to me and sung well (hmmmm maybe not Rebel's!). So a it worked for me as a musical as well. Also,i really could not see all the kerfuffle about the CGI. Its was fine. I loved the dancing and unlike the stage play it was a bit of a treat to be able to see the expressions on the actors faces. Dame Judi Dench, Francesca Hayward , Jennifer Hudson and Robbie Fairchild gave strong performances. If you haven't seen it go see it for yourself. (Seriously you could do much worse, like ""The Dead Dont Die""!)"
10.0,23 December 2019,"The choreograph is the most amazing thing I have ever scene, a long with the scenery. If you are a person who likes movies or musicals and doesn't critique them to every single small detail, then this is for you."
7.0,30 December 2019,"I saw Cats on Broadway years ago and I was not impressed. However, in watching the previews of the movie, I decided to give it another chance. I was very pleased with the movie. While I agree that the storyline is a bit thin, I found the movie very entertaining. The choroegraphy and dancing were excellent. The costumes will probably win an academy award. Now, neither of the two items above are reason enough to go see a movie. However, I was sufficiently entertained by the movie itself and the other items (noted above) are beneficial addons to make the movie even more enjoyable."
10.0,22 December 2019,"People who hate this, are people who don't understand theatre. This is bringing an amazing opera to the silver screen! And they do so by staying as true to theatre as possible while adding movie magic! Film critics will hate this, because they don't get theatre. As will the casual cinema goer. This isn't meant for them, and think its harsh to give is such bad ratings. The music, the dance, the acting - Jennifer Hudson especially - amazing! How can it desever 2*??? People jumping on the hate wagon for no reason. Beautiful movie! And my nieces loved it, being children."
6.0,26 March 2020,"If you don't know what the stage musical is about, then this movie will just seem like utter nonsense. Because it kind of is. There's not a great story there, but man there is some good music. Until Phantom, Cats was the longest-running Broadway show. And don't forget that the show, in turn, was based on some old T.S. Eliot poetry about cats. It's just bizarre stuff all around. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. It's exactly what I imagined. This is a movie adaptation of a stage musical. I don't disagree that it works much better as a stage musical, but this version is not without its merits. Some great performances by Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen. The music was as great as it's always been. Catchy songs by Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber. I'm still humming the familiar tunes a week later. However, the singing could've been better. So what's terrible about this movie that makes everyone hate it so much? Like I said, strange material for a movie. Also, creepy CGI and a bland performance from the lead. Not much structure. It's more like a series of songs being tied together by the occasional dialog. If you're looking for a more typical 3-act Hollywood formula, look elsewhere. Overall, definitely worth a watch if you love musicals."
10.0,9 August 2020,"Lots of bad reviews and for me was great, If you like the theater version you will love this one, don't expect a Marvel movie"
7.0,31 December 2019,"Had to chime in after seeing so many bad reviews. The singing was fantastic, the dancing was wonderful. Big deal the makeup was CGI it was still singers and dancers. I have seen the stage production 3 times and yes it's different but that didn't make it bad. I really enjoyed it s as md would go see it again."

8.0,26 December 2020,"I adore this film, I'm not sure what people were expecting, it's a film version of a theatre show, so of course they look like people dressed as cats, just as the theatre show is. It's not meant to be a realistic portrayal of cats, its about music and dance telling the whimsical stories of these characters. I think it does this beautifully with both humour and genuine emotion. I also love the casting of both well known actors and professional dancers. A true gem!"
6.0,22 December 2019,"I didnt love this movie and it wont be a favourite however I did enjoy watching it. It was different, replicated a theatre vibe very well (which was the intention) and put a smile on my kids faces. The 3 year got bored at parts but the 7 year old loved it.

The team obviously worked very hard on all aspects of the movie and that came across, the visuals were very interesting and although it was dark in places it didn't affect my opinion. Not all musicals can be sunshine and rainbows.

Personally I think some of the views are harsh but obviously each to their own."
8.0,13 January 2022,"I've been a huge fan of ""Cats"" the musical for years. I love the songs, I've seen stage productions a couple of times. And I was excited to have learned that there would be a cinematic version of the musical. I didn't know what to expect and how it would be done. So when I watched it in cinema I was really impressed with the scale of this film. I didn't know the characters were hugely computer generated, I simply thought the costumes were amazing 🤣. And you know what? CGI doesn't bother me at all. I simply love it! If I wanted to watch another costumed versions then I'd just go and watch a play again. What the buys and gals from the CGI ndepartment achieved here is simply mind-blowing! It makes me laugh when I read about 'human / cat hybrids' and people having nightmares after watching this lovely film. All those people who say those things clearly have no imagination and no inner child in them."

10.0,19 July 2020,"It's all over the place especially with size..BUT, the musical was also..it didn't make sense but it was the magic that made it theatre.. and it delivered on that. So I think people reviewing it don't know the musical. Or they expected more..but they didn't change the musical and the musical IS effing weird. We just never noticed it because going to the theatre we transported and accepted the weirdness. If that makes sense

It was one of the first musicals I saw live and I'll never forget it. It transported me and showed me the magic of theatre. I didn't know what the F was going on but it didn't matter.

That's how the movie is haha"
7.0,2 January 2020,Its not about watching an drama or action movie but watching the broadway presentation of Cats from a front seat. I love how well each of the cast members portrayed and carried their characters. It made such a huge difference in experiencing their performances up close.
9.0,2 January 2020,"I love the play Cats! The movie was the same story , music and dancing ! It was embellished in ways only a movie could do. The dancing, singing and makeup costumes were excellent . They looked like and acted like cats . If you liked the play Cats and like the animal cats you would love the movie. The story is simple explaining the different types of cats as they perform in order to be chosen by Old Deuteronomy to be the cat who gets a new life. They all tell there story and the type of cat they are to win the new life. Sorry to see all the negative reviews which almost stopped me from going. However being a Cats play fan I didn't let the reviews deter me . I went to see the movie and I was so glad I did !!"
6.0,23 December 2019,"It's all about opinions, but I found the film highly entertaining. The plot is very simple so not sure why people have expressed it as non existent.

Went with my 6 and 8 year old kids and although they found the first 20 minutes a bit confusing, they loved it after that."

8.0,2 January 2020,"I loved this movie, much better than the broadway edition. t.s. eliot's cat poems leave lots of room for Hooper's interpretation and his addition of the story line from the eyes of Victoria is a genius way to make sense of it. Also the way that multiple cats contribute to each character's song was very enjoyable. The acting was superb."
6.0,27 January 2020,"I just had to see this movie.

Unfortunate moments notwithstanding, it's not half bad. Before you dislike the heck out of me, please let me explain:

The criticisms can mostly be reduced to 1 bullet point: ""It's weird"". And that is the opposite of a criticism, surely?

Cats is weird. The elevator pitch tells you that.

It's not a conventional plot: a bit like ""Nutcracker"" storywise, but with its brief plot spread more thinly throughout. It's actually very mysterious in practice. On the VHS, the numerous visual details of cats interacting have inspired a plethora of fanfiction for the cryptic narrative. A looser variation of the 3 act structure, it's a Macfarlanesque cavalcade of feline splendour that can do anything and go anywhere, allowing stand alone ideas while maintaining all the development of story.

They have made every effort to demarcate this from the stage show, most obviously through a color scheme, rejecting the elegiac blue-grey-black for a glitzy yellow-orange-black to recreate London at night. The stage show was bound to one (really cool) set but now, with movie magic, they presented us with the city lights and imposing household interiors that are the real cat's eye view of the world.

It's tempting to assume that they did not give the audience the credit to just follow a narrative that keeps its cards close to its chest because they have endeavored to tell a story that leaves a lot to the imagination and then try to fill those gaps without radical changes to the story. The original musical worked as a story because it backed itself and revelled in its own mysteriousness but here we have an unhappy medium between the deliciously unanswered questions on one paw and a conventionally coherent narrative on the other. Fortunately, the fragmented narrative style sort of acts like a shock absorber. The decision to make Victoria the protagonist is logical when you think that in the original stage show, the cats can talk to us but now, with the screen dividing us, we need some sort of audience surrogate. She sings, dances and acts captivatingly.

The spoken asides are merely brief interludes to the musical numbers. I wonder if there wasn't untapped potential in trying to really go the whole hog and just make this a more familiar type of musical with a lot of spoken speech as cool-downs between the numbers, even if it involved contriving a new plot. I felt a lot could have been gained by allowing itself to revel in the moment more. When they do hold off from singing there is a lot of expositional dialogue. I quite liked just guessing why they shunned Grizzabella but now I just know. Not that it doesn't have its moments like Victoria interacting with Deuteronomy. The plot they have spun around this actually isn't half bad. The new Macavity is basically a new character for all the new personality they put in him. He is so badass it's almost a pity he's the antagonist. It plays out engagingly and, again, lets me enjoy the story in a new way. The character arc of Mr. Mistofolees was shaky but ultimately was pretty charming only they didn't really go far enough in fleshing it out.

Speaking of the musical numbers: I am not a huge Lloyd Webber fan. I find him very hit and miss. But you know how in some musicals, some of the songs are just placeholders for fun lyrics? Well, not here. Each song is one to enjoy again and again no matter what language they're in. They've tweaked the lyrics so that the title cat sings more of their own song than they did in the original and...well I guess it doesn't change anything. Musicologically they're pretty much intact if a bit flipped around. I noticed so many teency differences in the lyrics, it's like researching the changes George Lucas made on the re-releases of Star Wars, but it's all harmless.

My most favouritist song of the show (Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer) has had a bit of a revamp. It was originally an old school musical theatre piece with an Edwardian twist. But now it's been dipped in a kind of roaring Twenties flavour and admittedly it was pretty cool. Again, if I wanted to listen to the other version...I can anytime! Jessica Hudson's Grizabella injects some gospelly soul into this guilty pleasure. Again, agreeably different. Ian McCellan stands out with all the depth and power of Christopher Lee's heavy metal career. Even if everything else they are saying about this movie is true, please believe that Ian just brings it hear, not just in his singing but in his power to make anything seem significant. I can be a bit sour grapes about Taylor Swift, but her and Andrew's original song for the musical is actually...kinda nice. It's a gently heartbreaking little piece that is clearly trying to sort of be Memory pt II but it is so on-brand and has a sweet melody. Swift as a performer here is...adequate. James Corden actually shines as Bustopher Jones. He's really too young for the role but he puts heart into it. Rebel Wilson as Jennyannydots is just bizarre. She is blatantly miscast. She eats one of her cockroaches and those mice-children are just horrific. Just make them mice! And of course: Good ol' Judy...she just can't go wrong. I don't care how many genders you have to bend: if it brings Judy Dench into your movie, you do it.

My only issue with the music is that they cut away from it so often. Typically it's the movie sagging under its own star power. I think the executives thought ""make sure you give Wilson and Corden a whole bunch of screen time, the kids will love it!"". There are many such moments that just disrupt the flow, though not irreparably (the songs are that good). At one point Jennyannydots suggests that The Rum Tum Tugger has been neutered because he can hit a high note. If she had just observed ""he can hit the high notes"" and made that scissors gesture, it wouldn't be a strong joke but at least it would work. This moment is a microcosm of the movie's handling of original attempts at humour: not only surplus to requirements but what we have isn't even executed well.

Another thing that bothered me was something I struggle to put into words...this could again be my bias as a fan but sometimes they perform the song as just songs, like a recording artist would, not like a musical theatre major would in which they don't just utilize their voice as a beautiful instrument but really crack into the character and the story. The visualization and pacing of a scene probably played a part too.

I mentioned how they updated M&R: for me the Musical was sort of a bastion of Quintessential English Quaintness. They have modernized it and thus inevitably Americanized it but that isn't really a problem. Along with the narrative issues I mentioned above, it makes the whole picture feel quite adventitious; something that was never meant to be, but just sort of exists from the collision of several discrete creative minds and the wrong people having way too much creative control.

Finally I get to the thing that everyone is talking about: the cats themselves. When I first saw the trailer I thought they looked rather grotesque. Again, it's the problem of too much star power. Why put such high profile names if you're just going to hide the faces? Said the producers to each other over hot-tub-caviar. Thus we get these jarringly human faces glued onto the cat body. But not all the cats were like this. I am tempted to say they should've either just made the whole thing an animated musical with photorealistic cats or used practical effects.

But ultimately I found that you can get used to this. It actually gave it a kooky charm, like the visible strings of a marionette or or how a Japanese cartoon characters talk like ventriloquist dummies. The fact that the face is basically intact stops it from being uncanny valley. The performers do evoke the body language of cats, harmonizing the movement types of two species into one organism. They go together without mixing but never mind. The fur is admittedly really detailed and even moves in the wind in a way that had me hypnotized. I like how they integrated cat sounds into the speech; the sultry purrs, the high pitched mewing for Tugger...Nice.

On an angry note, I was promised something way more sexual than this. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't sensual and to be honest I wanted to cuddle with each cat but they said it looked like weird but boy did they hyperbolize. It's not a new kind, it's a very old kind: ballet! Ballet is sexy! But maybe some people can't take it. So yeah: the people who said this movie made them physically uncomfortable for all the cat-on-cat touching are people I suspect are just unfairly projecting their own neuroses onto the movie.

My biggest problems are either knitpicky or a fixation on something they didn't do. But one can go on forever about what something ISN'T and it only distracts from the good things that it IS.

In this movie they do a very particular thing, for a very particular type of person. They have constructed this lurid, garish world contrived of the choicest parts of both dreams and nightmares, woven with CGI, with people who are not people, non-humans who are all too human. This movie is a creepy, uncomfortable phantasmagoria of glorious weirdness that you just need to take on the chin as a sequence of strange moments that lead you into a magical new world, all the more magical for being familiar.

It is an experience that is enriched by the various artistic choices that have you scratching your head. Even if this movie goes against present standards of cool or decency (decency is code for boring!), it can at least say it is genuinely unique. And in a world with too many whooshy horror movies, trite romantic comedies and so many Spiderman movies, that has to count for something.

Let Cats take you on a ride you will not soon forget."
8.0,27 December 2019,"This is just lovely, the worst best film i've seen this year by far. All the top actor, high profile director, millions of dollars all of those just wasted, gone. Everyone should watch this as an example and visualization of life failures. Let this be the ""Plan 9"" of our genration."
6.0,1 January 2020,"I am a big fan of Cats. My expectations were a bit on the lower side after watching every trailer and behind the scene videos released. Overall, the movie was pretty much as expected. A live action/cg version of the original. The dancing was entertaining, especially Skimbleshanks' scene. It followed the same storyline as the musical, give or take a little. Victoria is given more of an active roll this time around and her own song. I'm bummed not all of the songs were included but I get it. The only part that really bothered me was Rebel Wilson and James Corden's parts. Both characters were changed to cater to the actor's quirks and neither landed on the feet. Taylor's role was also really small compared to the way it was built up. Overall, I enjoyed it. Great? No, but definitely enjoyable."
9.0,16 October 2022,"It's honestly really upsetting how this movie was treated. It's absolutely no different than the stage play, better in my opinion. The stage play has people dressed up as cats while this one uses cgi to do it. No difference. The songs are great and the whole thing is really fun, really dumb how people can't get past any weird hang ups they have. This is exactly a movie representation of the play. If you liked the play then you would like this but I think all the reviews are from people who have never even seen the play so not sure why they felt the need to watch it at all. I actually really liked this movie and it shouldn't be buried."
6.0,26 January 2020,"Yes the first half of the film is slow and quite dull, however as is the way with west end shows, the 2nd half is much better.

I know I'm in the minority but I actually really like CGI, it adds the feline characteristics to the actors, the little ear movements and tail movements add to the reality of this film

There are 2 dodgy performances by Jason Derulo and Ray Winstone, particularly highlighted when there is a scene from Sir Ian McKellen just after a Jason Derulo scene and they are polar opposites in performance. Other than that all are passable with the two leads dancing beautifully."
8.0,7 January 2020,"I went to see this film the night before the New Years, so it makes it the last movie I watched in the 2010's. And I regret nothing. This thing was a real spectacle, from its plot and attempts at humor, to obviously the character designs and CGI - everything was wonderfully horrendous.

If I was ever starting to feel bored by the story or the absence thereof, I would just pay attention to the mess that is this movie's visual effects. Cats' feet (or should I say ""paws"") would get stuck in the textures or slide across the floor without ever interacting with it; their shoes would magically appear and disappear in different shots; faces on the background would sometimes become PS1-level rudimentary and just levitate separate from the bodies. Basically all the visuals in Cats are the creation of pure chaos but without them the movie is extremely boring. While it has some kind of a story, it drags entirely too long. All that matters is the last 15 minutes of the film, which are not even that good, aside from Jennifer Hudson's performance, which is probably the only unironically good part of the movie. The rest of Cats is just pointless and kind of sleep-inducing. Attempts at humor are the next level of cringe, especially Corden's and Wilson's parts. And some of the character designs look like side effects of Hermione Granger's potion from the Chamber of Secrets mixed with a very poorly performed transfiguration spell.

Overall, Cats is one of the most memorable films of 2019 and, dare I say, of the decade for all the wrong reasons. I will definitely rewatch it once it comes out on Blu-ray and laugh my as* off one more time."
6.0,30 December 2019,"I would not pay too much attention to the reviews here.

Go see it for yourself.

I think it is a visual treat of imagination and creativity. They are trying to capture the spirit of alley cats.

Remember, this is not a science fiction CGI blockbuster. It is a musical."
10.0,20 December 2019,A Magnificent Masterpiece of Cinema! The bad reviews and IMDB rating are because of people who despise the idea behind this Musical in the first place! One of the most popular musicals of All-Time Cats does unfortunately have a marmite effect and plenty of haters! I cannot recommend this film enough! It is SUPERB!
6.0,9 January 2020,"Watching this for the first time I knew nothing about musicle ""Cats"" and it's lore. Moreover, the first impression wasn't that bad 5/10... I really liked the revolutionary graphics and the whole dancing & singing thing. The main reason why I went on it were Les Twins;)

Before watching this movie for the second time I've prepared and read a lot about original story. This changed my impression and I started to note the cardinal differences in lore. Are they good or bad? I don't know and actually not really care, because the stunning performances take all the attention.

In my opinion, you need to be doing music, dancing or acting techniques in real life, to enjoy the movie properly. Only than, you can soberly review what you are watching. Cats never were a movie and the 2019 version is not, as well. 7/10."
8.0,22 December 2019,If you don't appreciate musical theater you're obviously not going to enjoy this. I realize hating things is a fun hobby for most but this is just ridiculous.
7.0,4 January 2020,This movie was a bit different than the play. They have added characters and other surroundings. I enjoyed it because of the wonderful dancing. Jennifer Hudson's performance was worth the price of admission alone. Yes it is odd but the play was odd. You're looking at people acting like cats so what do you expect. If you saw the play and enjoyed it or if you love good music and dancing disregard what people or the critics are saying and go see it!
10.0,8 January 2020,"Cats is horrifying. And no, I don't mean the CGI (well, not just because of the CGI) or anatomical strangeness of these creatures. Let me lay out some of the scariest facts: 1. These cats are dead. This isn't a spoiler. It's the ""plot"" of the movie. I don't know how more people haven't realized they're already dead and competing to be reborn. The second song is on gravestones for goodness sake. 2. They live in purgatory where their lives are controlled by Judi Dench for no real reason. She gets her powers from the moon and arbitrarily decides every cat's fate. 3. Idris Elba has completely undefinable powers, but he can basically do whatever he wants with you and when he's done, you'll be an outcast doomed to sulk in the shadows like poor Jennifer Hudson. 4. Underpinning all this is a hellscape where mice and cockroaches with human faces and bodies are kept as slaves and forced to perform for their cat masters who are free to eat you when you don't perform well or if if they're in the middle of a song. These cockroaches and mice scream for their lives as they're eaten. 5. There are no rules. This is chaos, and no one is safe.

It's what I imagine a hallucinogenic trip would feel like. The inexplicable high top shoes blew my mind. The final song (which establishes that cats are not in fact dogs, just in case you were wondering I guess) is sung with them standing on a freaking lion statue.

Because of (in spite of?) all this, seeing Cats in the theater was the best moviegoing experience of my life. I laughed so hard at one point I had to get up and walk to the back of the theater while I regained control. This movie is like The Room except with an insane budget. Nothing made sense and I am thrilled that it was the first movie I watched in the new decade."
7.0,3 January 2020,"I watched this movie on New Years Eve with two friends (that I forced to attend with me). In the moment, I was kinda bored. I found the songs too long, the JUST dancing with no signing or dialogue was too often. There is so little dialogue in this film (collectively about the length of the shortest song, which I believe to be a minute and a half). In the moment, I could get over the CGI issues, though the clothing and accessories looked like a social media camera filter. So I wasn't that fond of it. I was expecting a level of terrible that wasn't realised, but I wouldn't have said it was good. Let's get to the part where my opinion changed. I didn't hate the film, I just wished it was a little less boring. It's been a few days since I watched the film and I felt the urge to download the album on Apple Music (doesn't have all the songs, which is disappointing). Since then, it's an understatement to say I've become obsessed. I finished watching the movie thinking I'd never bother to watch it again, now I can't wait for its release to DVD. It's not that I've become interested in the musical itself, because really, they're not THAT different (trust me, I've looked at the musical and really, I have just as much to pick at that as I do the film), it's just that I have a new found appreciation for it. The singing was good, the acting was pretty good, the story was okay, the CGI wasn't THAT bad. I liked all of the beautiful areas they went to. I'd say watch it, don't expect a master piece, but don't expect it to be as terrible as people say it is. Because it's not terrible, but it certainly isn't amazing. There were mistakes they made in production that could have been handled better, but really, you can ignore that if needed."
10.0,7 December 2022,"The people who rated this movie so low are clearly from a background or generation that has been spoiled by modern movies to the point that they haven't needed to use their imagination since kindergarten. They clearly were expecting to see CGI cats aka the ""live"" movie version of the Lion King, but honestly, watching these dances being done by cat bodies would just be... weird and disturbing.

People who watched this movie expecting award winning dialogue or an intriguing plot worthy of a Screenwriters Oscar were ALWAYS going to be very, very disappointed. The plot/storyline was NEVER the point of the play, but rather, it's a very thin framework created ONLY, and I do mean ONLY, to display the music and the dancing. On the other hand, anyone who ever saw and enjoyed the play undoubtedly enjoyed the movie because of the faithful adaption of the music and dancing.

The MUSIC and DANCING. That's it. There was never, ever, ever going to be anything else. That's the whole point of the play, and the whole point of the movie. If you go to the Broadway play or the movie hoping to be entertained by ANYTHING ELSE, you are going to be very disappointed.

Francesca Hayward performs the role of Victoria perfectly, and honestly is one of the most talented dancers I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

Dame Judi Dench is always marvelous and did not disappoint, and Idris Elba as Macavity was spot on.

Frankly, I had forgotten that Taylor Swift was in the movie until I came to IMDb to do this review and scrolled through the cast. All I knew was the woman singing as Bombalarina knocked the song out of the park, and now I know why.

The sets and costumes (cgi aided) are faithful adaptions of the play. The music and dancing were perfectly performed by the entire cast.

Many people have described this movie as the worst of all time. Buddy, it's not even the worst movie I've seen TODAY, but I came in expecting singing and dancing, and I was not disappointed.

The intent was clearly to produce a film version of the play with some added cgi effects, and they were quite successful in this endeavor. Because of the bad reviews, I came into this movie with extremely low expectations and ended up impressed enough to write the longest review of my life to defend it."
7.0,10 January 2020,If you're a fan of musicals I actually think this movie did a good job at one. People are upset about the CGI however what did you expect? It's people as cats. I think the music was amazing and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.
8.0,24 December 2019,"I loved the stage production and the film is every bit as good. Yes, it's bonkers - it's a bunch of cats getting together for one of them to be chosen to go live a new and better life. The stage version is songs only, some speaking parts have been added to the film and the show tweaked to great effect. Every song tells each cats own story. If you don't like musicals, or cats, then probably not for you. Some great performances and songs I've been singing for days. JHud singing Memory is stupendous."
6.0,28 December 2019,"It's the CGI..! The entire movie feels messy because of the really really bad special effects, especially around the hands and faces of the background cats. But Universal said they're re-releasing with better effects so fingers crossed.

Overall, I think you can enjoy the film if you ignore the nudeness and the effects. The songs are actually good, Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift performances are superb. The choreography is meticulous and so interesting to watch. The story is actually not as confusing as people say it is, it's just a very straight-forward fictional story.

So enough with the negative reviews, like IT IS NOT THAT BAD!!"
8.0,26 December 2019,"I really don't understand the negative reviews. The movie was true to the written story which clearly a lot of people have not read! T S Eliot wrote Cats 80 years ago as a fantasy story for his grandchildren. Exactly what happens in the movie is what happened in the written story by an author who loved cats as did his grandchildren. I really don't see what is creepy or disturbing about people acting as cats compared to stage actors dancing around the stage dressed up as cats. I found the movie visually satisfying, the singing sublime and the cast were great. I think it's unfortunate the media appeared to decide beforehand to trash the movie so all the haters go with a biased view and join in with the trashing. Such a shame. So many many people behind the scenes would've worked so hard on that movie."
6.0,3 February 2020,"If you're looking for a fast and simple sum-up, my headline says it all. The crushing hard reviews are uncalled for. But what you need to know before you start watching is: 1. This is a filming of the classic musical. So yeah, the story is pretty set. The characters and story itself is what it is, and there are some parts that maybe should have gone another way for a stronger film. But again, this is a filming of the musical. It's not a ""based on..."" or newly written film. Theatrical musicals are limited in different ways than movies are. 2. Yes, it's about people dressed up as cats and acting out a cat's life. (Just like the story always has been.) This means you have to accept this general fact. Is it stupid, maybe, but it's the same story that's been running on Broadway and in London for years and years. If you aren't willing to accept that ""Cats"" is about cats, well - surprise, you won't like this film.

If you can accept these two rather simple facts, you will end up seeing a very special movie, just because of them. Its music, its dance, its family focused drama. I went with my 14 year old and we both enjoyed it! Have I seen better movies? Of course, but I have seen plenty, plenty worse.

And I also have to say, just because this movie is one of a kind, makes it special. Never before has Andrew Lloyd Webbers creations become so alive, with CGI-animated ""cats"" (remember rule no 2). There are so many mainstream films, regardless of genre. I found it refreshing with a different take, almost more like a form of art, than a movie. And maybe that explains a lot, because art isn't for everyone. Some love it, some don't.

Give it a try!"
9.0,23 December 2019,I will admit before watching this I was sceptical because of all the reviews saying how bad it was. Honestly it was better. The story was clear and entertaining. The soundtrack was amazing and every song is memorable enough that you'll be singing them when the movie is finished. The cast in it are brilliant and each character is likeable in their own way. What you need to realise is this is based on a musical which was based on the book. I don't know what movie others were watching but I loved the one I was watching.
7.0,26 December 2019,"While I didn't care for the new song, I loved the movie and was singing along with it and was crying along with Memory."
8.0,31 December 2019,"I have been reading a lot of negatives from all over and I thought why not I go see this film myself. To my surprise, I was not disappointed! I was moved and just had many tears in my eyes. This is beyond the exceptions! I love every scenes. It is completely different than the stage and the film. Tom Hopper is genius! The talents did fantastic jobs. My friends and I leave with the good feeling. I hope you go see this movie for yourself. This is fun, entertaining and something to celebrate yourself. Good job!!!"
6.0,31 December 2019,You know. It was a musical. It had lovely music and performances like Jennifer Hudson's. James cordon and Judy Dench. Taylor Swift too were well acted. I don't believe it is only a 2.7 rating. Look at the whole creative picture people !
8.0,29 March 2020,"I watched this the other day while self-quarantining. A few hours earlier, I had drunk some mushroom tea. I was freaking out and tried to watch Toy Story 4, but it made me really sad and emotional. Two or three hours into the trip though, I managed to click on ""Cats"". The colours looked amazing. It carried me through the rest of it. I couldn't look away. The cat people are trippy and strange looking but funny to watch and the songs make no sense, but it was perfect - it was as if we had all agreed to participate in this madness together. Nothing made sense but somehow that was alright. I don't think I will ever watch this movie again but I will never forget how the Jellicle cats (I don't know what it means) got me safely through. 10/10"
7.0,1 January 2020,"When I first saw the trailer I thought, ""Eww!"" But after seeing the trailer several more times (we saw a lot of movies over the holidays) I got used to the cat effects and then saw the movie. It was pretty good. Excellent choreography and very good singing. I never thought the musical had much of a plot, and the plot concocted for the movie isn't much better."
9.0,25 December 2019,"I understand the criticism, if I put myself in the position of someone who doesn't understand musicals or spectacle. I enjoyed this, and my 9 year old daughter was glued to the screen. The pacing is a bit off. The first 20 min is abruptly one song after another, but it has a beautiful story, even if the film is not story-centered. Steven McRae's Skimbleshanks number was so much fun to watch, I'm still singing the song. In true Tom Hooper style, it's beautifully shot and designed. But if you don't like musicals, this isn't for you. It's the most music-y of musicals. It's eccentric art. If it's not your style, that doesn't make it ""bad."""
7.0,23 December 2019,"Are the character designs appalling? Yes. Is the plot a meandering mess that requires precursory knowledge or a perfect eye and ear to follow? Most definitely. Is this movie's self indulgence rivaled only by the Roman empire? Absolutely.

But for some reason... I just can't make myself hate this movie. It's just too much fun. I found myself involuntarily smiling and wanting to cheer and clap multiple times throughout. The music is excellent, although it might be a bit wordy and non-catchy for some. The choreography is stunningly written and performed. It's the most perfect gaudy, self-absorbed, campy, ridiculous movie I've ever seen. It's just so unabashedly insane and sincere about being just that from start to finish. I love it.

But I do recognize its faults. From a purely objective standpoint, it is not very good. In fact, it's what some would call awful. But like I said, it's just something that had so much character and spirit that I found myself thoroughly enjoying every minute of the runtime. If you love ridiculous, cheesy, unafraid fun, then please go see this movie. Lord knows it could use some revenue."
10.0,26 December 2019,"Really loved the film trying to work out who was who, I was expecting Taylor Swift to be in the film more as her name was used in the advertising and other big names but it turned out that most of the people playing the characters that where on screen the most, where not as well know as the the ones that appeared for short scenes in the film. But in their own field of entertainment they are probably very well know, I enjoyed the film immensely having seen the musical in the Drury Lane theater some years back so I knew the plot & story. The CGI was amazing it really looked like they where wearing fur or a catsuit with fur on with hoods, it was well blended into the actors & actresses. If you know what cats is based on, seen the theater production or like song & dance then this will be right up your ally cat."
6.0,30 January 2020,"Although people do not like the movie, me neither, the CG is great in some points. Considering the amount and the difficulty of the CG elements, I have to say they did a great job."
10.0,27 December 2019,"There's literally nothing wrong with this movie. It's just a good movie. Aside from the animation worsening a bit on cats in the corners of the screen, the film is well executed, the singing is phenomenal, and people are just hating on this because they want to, and to me, that's really sad. This was someone's dream and audiences are stomping all over it. Hopefully it continues to make money from people who go see it with an open mind, but unfortunately, it it isn't Disney, it is being pounded into the ground for taking risks and being weird. Heck, even when Disney does do something weird, it's never truly weird, and I'm sick and tired of people blasting anything they find different just because it's different. Beautiful music, beautiful acting, beautiful casting, and beautiful choreography aren't enough for people anymore. Not even for a movie that's essentially one giant dream, scary bits and all."
10.0,26 April 2020,"Let's be honest it's based off a Broadway show were people dress up as cats, that dance and sing. What was every one expecting?

I thought most of the songs were not very catchy.

I liked the tap dance song, and the song the chick sang after Hudson's first Memory Performance. I thought the first 3 songs went longer than they should.

Hudson Knocked it out of the park at the 1 hour and 27 min mark with the Goosebump worthy performance of Memory. For me, that made the movie."
10.0,5 April 2020,"My family and I loved it. Most peoples complaints appear to be very emotive and do not have any constructive reasons why they hate it. Probably the same people that are continual whingers, complainers, uneducated to the arts and contribute to the reasons why I refuse to use Facebook anymore. Its certainly not a Cats Musical you go to as a show, but as a movie I thought was good entertainment."
10.0,12 February 2023,"A tribe of cats called the Jellicles every year must make a big decision on a special night: choose one of the cats to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and get a new and better life. Each of the cats tells their story to their leader, old Deuteronomy, in an attempt to be chosen.

Visually beautiful, but extremely musical and boring, the script doesn't attract me either, I like the trio, Idris, Reben and Taylor, but here it was hard to win, cute, but ordinary, lie, very well produced, but boring... I went to the end just for the sake of honor, because the urge was to give up in the first 10 minutes, despite being visually perfect, mostly boring, scriptedly boring..."
10.0,30 April 2020,"I liked this movie because I had seen the London recording as well as a live presentation many times, and I thought the movie made the whole thing very clear because it told a story."
9.0,22 April 2020,Francesca Hayward is captivating....I've seen cats on the stage it did not make any sense to me then...the film does not solve that mystery. 'Memory'by Jennifer Hudson is they only song that stands with the greats of any musicals. Being a musical that is obviously a big problem. The central character of Victoria is beautifully played and drew me through the effort made by the cast and crew.
10.0,16 May 2020,"My kids (ages 16,15,14,and 11, male and female) are fans of the original filmed version of Cats and were delighted by this remake. The dancers and actors and actresses involved were believable in their roles. The animation was a little off-putting for a couple of the kids to begin with but they were just fine with it less than halfway through. The cast and crew of this production have made a wonderfully fantastic movie and given us a new way to journey through T.S. Eliot and Andrew Lloyd Weber's vision. If you give this movie a chance, I think you will find something to dazzle you. The love and joy out into this movie are evident if you open your eyes."
10.0,28 December 2019,"Went in low expectations due to bad review's as kids really wanted to see it. Was surprised that was enjoyable, cgi cats bit weird ( you get used to it) and at times the music drowns out singing. Loved James and Rebel. Both my kids 7 & 10 loved the film one stating ""is it finished allready"". If you dont like musicals then perhaps give a miss, if you do, or have kids then check it out"

8.0,30 April 2020,"I went into it after only watching the older movie years ago. I'm an avid fan of musicals and adore the big names that starred in this. The cat outfits, the moving tails and the set were all super cute.

I enjoyed the story of the abandoned cat discovering the world and meeting all the contestants, making friends along the way, helping the homeless cat, and coming into her own.

Another musical I'll be adding into my collection, no matter what others think of this movie. I don't let other people's opinions change mine.. everything I watch is with my own eyes. I enjoy things for what they are. Watch it and make your own decision."
9.0,25 April 2020,"This movie was not horrible....but it was pretty bad. The singing was beautiful and Francesca Hayward's dancing was EXCEPTIONAL. I even shed a tear during a beautiful rendition of memory by Jennifer Hudson. The songs told amazing stories with great performances.

But the movie really hit hard with the visuals. While some of the settings were quite unique and detailed and the cats ears and tails were quite expressive, the animation lacked. The worst for me was the hands. They were human hands. And the faces didn't match the bodies too. The overall feeling of the movie was very strange and quite creepy.

Lastly some of my favorite parts were the magic song, memory, macavity, and beautiful ghosts."

10.0,8 April 2020,"The bad reviews for this movie seem to be coming from a herd of sheep people who read or more likely hear the bad reviews and then regurgitate the same. These are probably the same people who climb on the bandwagon and say they hate the word ""moist"", or in the past booed at the premier of ""The rites of Spring"" in 1913, or walked out of 2001 Space Odyssey in 1968 saying ""I dont get it"" after the critics first panned it

Please give this movie a chance-it is very good and full of brilliance at times. True it is a bit furrier than the original spandex clothed stageplay and movie, but those were ""odd"" at the time but nobody then seemed to mind. At the original London opening in 1981 Andrew Webber said he was scared that the audience wouldn't buy it and start laughing. Instead they gaped in amazement and then applauded it.

Open your minds and let the movie take you in. Many critics came around after seeing 2001 a second time only to declare it a masterpiece. This 2019 version isn't a masterpiece and you could argue that the original 1998 direct-to-video musical film is better, but both are wonderful and deserve applause. Yes this 2019 one is a bit silly and seems designed for a younger and/or more ignorant and/or simpler audience but it still has amazing dancing and singing. For example this boomer reviewer didn't know that Taylor Swift was that good, or how amazing Hayward is as a dancer.

If nothing else, see it again and learn how you can be influenced by word of mouth or a herd of sheep critics into believing something that is good is bad from ""fake news""."
10.0,19 June 2021,"Cats is a poem by TS Elliot published in 1939. It was later converted into a hit musical, by Andrew Lloyd Webber, keeping most of the poem intact. This gives the musical a nice contrast between the 80s music and 30s writing.

Unfortunately, this film has to be understood by American millenials, so a bit of rewriting was done to lower the needed IQ to understood it.

A musical needs excellent dancers and singers. A film needs excellent actors. This film has none of the above.

Taylor Swift is an average singer and certainly no Elaine Paige. Only reason for her in the film is to sell cinema tickets.

James Corden delivered a remarkably poor performance.

Judy Dench is completely misplaced.

The new extra songs were naturally awful as expected.

All in all it was okay. I doubt I will watch again."
10.0,24 December 2020,"Firstly, I am not a bot, my rating is genuine.

I have to admit that after reading so many negative reviews I was scared to watch Cats, thinking that I would also hate it. Having seen the original stage show run in Sydney when in high school, Cats has always been a favourite and I was genuinely fearful of how it would transition to the big screen given such bad publicity and ratings. But, I was pleasantly surprised. From watching the trailer, the movie was all I expected and more. Yes there are cheesy parts, but the one liners actually make it better. The sets are really well done. The choreography is excellent. The music is brilliant. To those saying that there is no storyline, you were obviously watching something else and got the two mixed up.

Here is a tip. Watch the trailers. If they creep you out - don't watch it!!! Simple!!! If like me they actually appeal to you, watch the movie and enjoy the big screen take on what is a brilliant stage show."
10.0,12 October 2020,"I heard the reviews but I have always wanted to see Cats. . Is it a feature of the musical to be be a intrigued or confused by the appearance of the performers ? The cat costumes or cgi itself is so distracting . Are they cute ? Attractive? Catlike ? Human like? I can't tell what I am supposed to be thinking about the visuals or what I actually think of the visuals . I don't want to hate it but I can't take it. I'm the play is this meant to be a point if confusion I don't know and frankly we didn't make it through the first number. I am going to forge ahead and will update. Maybe something changes maybe I can get over it and move on to the Scenery costuming storyline? So far I can't relate to the 'cats' I consider myself most forgiving with cgi being a sci fi -fantasy fan , I have tolerated some bizarre visuals for the greater endeavor of entertainment. I was hopeful now I am a bit lost I will regroup and try again"
9.0,4 April 2021,"Prior to seeing ""Cats"" on HBO the other day, all I knew about it was that it was a successful stage musical, but got savaged as a movie. That never made sense to me.

It still doesn't. ""Cats"" is a lively, endearing, sung presentation of T. S. Eliot's poems explaining the different personalities of cats and why they do what they do. There's a through plot about the group of cats known as Jellicles gathering together to see which one will be chosen for rebirth. You'll meet characters like Asparagus (aka Gus), a theatrical cat past his prime; Mr. Mestoffelees, a magical cat; Macavity, a devious cat who's meant as a clear analog to Professor Moriarty; Victoria, the cat who gets taken in when she's dumped by her owner; and of course Old Deuteronomy, the venerable cat who has final say on who goes to their heavenly reward and comes back.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's songs are as good as you'd expect, particularly the upbeat ""Mr. Mestophelees"", Jennifer Hudson's ""Memories"", and a funny, jazzy show stopper piece about the nefarious Macavity.

Two of the actors in particular should be praised. Francesca Hayward as Victoria delivers a beautiful, sensitive performance as our eyes into the cat world. And Dame Judi Dench...is there nothing she can't play? She doesn't get to do much for the bulk of the film, but makes up for it with a touching, big-hearted turn as wise Old Deuteronomy. The two of them at the end of the film are wonderful together.

Now, if you need to be convinced that so many of the bad reviews are just trolling, consider how many of them are rated 1. There is way too much good music, talent and beauty in this movie to rank it that low--especially when it's in many ways identical to the hit play from which it derives.

Some of the complaints I've seen (on YouTube and other places) are just ridiculous. With the possible exception of the opening scene where Victoria is dropped off on the street, the CG is fine. It's not supposed to be photorealistic, any more than the actors are supposed to spend the entire movie walking on all fours. The makeup work is far better than anything you'll see on the stage. And the silliest complaint of all? ""Cats with breasts? LOL."" Oh, give me a break. Like the stage version was performed by an all-male cast or something.

Give it a shot and see if you're not entertained. After it's over the song ""Macavity"" will be stuck in your head."

9.0,5 May 2021,"This flick hardly needs another review, but I can't stand all this nasty nonsense, so I'll pitch my own take. No, it's not a good movie, desperately needing better writing and ""some"" editing. Since I loved the stage plays, I saw it when it came out and was not impressed, barely finishing it, but watched it again recently. The dancing, music, sets, and costumes are magical. Several of the actors were engaging. Judi Dench and Jennifer Hudson were excellent. The actor playing Virginia and the ones playing Skimbleshanks and McCavity danced beautifully In spite of not having a proper cat, Taylor Swift was a lot of fun. Yeah, Corden and Rebel Wilson were unwatchable. Anyway, you can all go back to your piling on now!"
9.0,22 April 2020,"It was beautiful (I couldn't find the CGI issues), it was emotional (I laughed and cried), and it was fun. A couple if roles could have been cast better, there were a few places where I wasnt quite sure what was going on, but overall, I really enjoyed it."

9.0,4 April 2020,"In my view the Oscars should be won by movies that leave a definite mark on the public, movies everybody talks about. While I doubt many remember who won the Oscars this year, literally EVERYBODY speaks about Cats. Just the way people were talking about Titanic, years ago. Well, that's something... Mark my words, this movie will become a cult movie and will be seen as a horribly underrated movie in a few years time. I watched it yesterday online with very low expectations and I was surprised to find it entertaining, witty and quite emotional. The characters look creepy, indeed but so so the ones from the sage version. OK, there's very little logic in the plot, but people seem to forget this show is about CATS. The musical and dance numbers are beautiful. I absolutely loved Victoria, the Magical Cat, and the Theatre Cat (Sir Ian). Dame Judy Dench was adequate in her role too. It is heartbreaking to see how people enjoy hitting somebody who is already down. Maybe the movie doesn't deserve 10 stars, but it most DEFINITELY does not deserve 2.7 stars. This is an outrage. I advice everyone reading this to watch the movie and THINK for themselves."
10.0,19 August 2023,"This is actually a good movie. It just got bad reviews because nobody has context. There's a poem book written by T. S. Elliot called Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. That is what this play is based off of.

In the poem book, each poem is about a certain cat who is a character in the play. Sometimes they recite the poem while singing. Without reading the book, it would make absolutely no sense. And it's not a popular book at all, so I get it. You just need context.

With context, it's actually really fun. The production was done well and the songs are really good too. I just believe people need to read the book, that's all."
10.0,27 December 2019,There seemed enough of a story to hang a musical on. Francesca Hayward carried the movie with her movement and facial expressions. I am so glad we disregarded the negative trend of reviews and enjoyed an exceptional movie.
10.0,13 October 2020,"I found this movie to be absolutely charming. I don't understand why so many have given it a low score. The music was first rate, the actors brought the characters to life, and the dancing was top notch."
10.0,13 April 2020,Half of us including myself loved it. Others found it too creepy. 5 year was totally entranced!!!
9.0,23 January 2020,"I like cats. I like the musical but, this movie just did it wrong. It could have been more it could have been better but it wasn't. It didn't stay true to the plot, a lot of the characters didn't look like the originals and the CGI could have been done better. They should have spent more time on making the cats look better and not have them look so cursed. They did it with a few of the characters why not all? And lets not even talk about the mice and cockroaches."
10.0,3 June 2021,"As the positive critic reviews observe, this movie is not for everyone, but if you love song and dance numbers, this is one of the best filmed musicals in years. It beautifully mixes disparate styles from ballet to tap to break dancing, with Andrew Lloyd Webber's exceptional music to fit each style. Like most song and dance musicals, there is no plot to speak of, although this movie version improves on the play version by expanding the part of Victoria, the abandoned kitten looking for a home, and Francesca Hayward shows why she is considered one of the great ballerinas in the world; she is not much of a singer, but her little girl voice fits the song that Webber and Taylor Swift wrote for her. Robbie Fairchild.is perfect as Muskustrap, both as a singer and as dancing partner to Hayward in several of the numbers. Laurie Davidson is wonderful as Mr. Mistoffelees, the magician cat. I think a primary reason so many people were so disappointed was because the marketers insisted on emphasizing such cast members as Rebel Wilson (a disaster), Taylor Swift (with one short scene) and James Corden (ditto), when the true stars of show are the dancers, and Webber's musical adaption of T. S. Eliot's Book of Practical Cats.."
10.0,4 April 2020,"Never seen the stage show, but what are you expecting when people play cats? I just watched it to see the car crash, but was pleasantly surprised. Decent tunes and songs, with a exceptional stand out from Hudson."
10.0,3 June 2021,"Its different and it took a few minutes to get used to it but after that it was a great experience. Fantastic job by all the ""cats"".

Don't know why the massive amount of negative reviews, do people expect cats to be a lighthearted fun story?"
10.0,25 December 2019,The cgi is weird well at least not for me I'm fine with a cgi the characters are wonderful the music is GOOD just hear memory its good
8.0,25 August 2024,"I read all the bad reivews, but thought ill see for myself, now the filmisnt perfect and the first scene could do with a better song with a catchy chorus, but the cinematography was wonderful, and i loved the costumes, such an interesting way to portray cats, so many cat jokes, and fantastic people.

People say its the worst film of the year, oh come on, theres been much worst. Judi Dench and Sir Ian Mckellen were wonderful , purrfect.

I was a bit confused as to what the plot was, and why they had to choose a cat to go to cat heaven, but soon relaised it didnt matter, The magican song was very good and entertaining, as was of course memories.

Ive not seen the stage version but now i might have to go and see it, All in all a fun film filled with song and dance."
10.0,24 December 2019,"I had a really good time watch this watch movie. It's a beautiful and wonderful movie, but not one for the majority. But wth, even on stage, Cats had never been something everybody can get. Cats is a perfect musical with many hidden layers of meaning. You have to look deeper into the movie to see them, like European films. It is the perfect blend between a good story, great music and great dancing. My only complaint is that there could have been more long take, to let us see the wonderful dancing numbers better instead of those fast-pace short cuts. It's still wonderful by the way. I didn't expect Cats to be everyone's cup of tea, I expected that people would give it an unfair rating of 5-6 star. But no, you guys have to go being prejudiced and give it a 1 star! That is so UNFAIR. The visual of this movie is a bit different, yes. The story is a bit different, yes. But those are good differences! People are too harsh and prejudiced against this movie because of how a few people reacted when the trailer first came out. Remember when everybody commented that the Cats movie trailer looked like a bad horror and give them nightmare? Even back then I thought the trailer was wonderful and people just pick on the movie because they saw other people react to it. I rarely write review, but people are having such hostile reactions to this movie that I have to write this. Because to me, this movie is not the best, yes, but it's great, and I had a wonderful time watched it."
9.0,9 May 2021,"It's weird. It's Cats. It does not deserve the hatred it has inspired.

The movie was true to the story. They do pretty much all of the musical numbers, with little dialog in-between to make sense of it all. Which makes sense, because it's Cats.

Idris Elba is the bad cat. Francesca Hayward, of the Royal Ballet, is luminous in her only feature film role as lead cat. She's an incredible dancer, and what an unfortunate introduction for her, because most everyone hates this film.

Many have not seen the stage musical, in order to say, ""What the heck?"" before seeing the film.

I am a TS Eliot fan. He is the poet who wrote the book (Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats) that created the basis for the lyrics for Cats . I have read Practical Cats. It did not help.

People should go into the film expecting total weirdness--and greatness on the part of the lead, Francesca Hayward."
10.0,17 December 2022,"I saw the musical in 1983 in London when it was red hot breaking records cover of Time Magazine. Someone was smart enough to have me read TS Elliott's poem book about cats . Without it watching the performance I would have been lost and it would have made a little sense. So now let's turn that into a movie and give no real explanation about what's going on and why it's going on other than hoping people can listen to the lyrics and get some sort of idea of what's happening. Let's for a second imagine that Tommy the who's rock opera was performed by dogs. Or godspell was ferrets. People would've lost theireminds.

In the end I figured TS Elliott was fascinated with cats and thought they were crazy. And let's face it he wasn't completely wrong. They're an acquired taste... as is this film."
10.0,22 December 2019,"If you didn't see the original musical, you will find it bizarre. However, for the original Cats fans it's a must see!"
8.0,18 April 2020,"This musical, even in the theater, has always been for a lover of the LLoyd Webber die hards. I wonder if they just tried too hard with the special effects like the twitching tails, whether Deuteronomy being female instead of male upset the die hards. I thought the ballet skills of the new abandoned cat were beautiful and thought Grizabella was fantastic. Such a shame this musical got so poorly scored. Cats was always going to be love it or hate it even in the theater. For me mostly it ticked my boxes but did not like the twitching tails. Not the sort of musical I want to see computer generated special effects. I would watch it again as I love musicals but I can understand to some extent why this did not score greatly. It is a rambling musical even in the theater without a strong underlying storyline and for those that did not know that they were expecting more. I loved it myself and was better than I anticipated after reading the poor reviews."
9.0,30 December 2019,"I've seen Cats on stage multiple times and always love it. I've purchased the musical on film. I've bought the soundtrack. I've loved it for years. I read some of the reviews for this film & feared it would disappoint me... it did not! I loved it!!! If anything, it gave me a better understanding of the musical. I would definitely see it again & will likely buy copies of this production and this soundtrack. Please don't let the reviews discourage you, especially if you love the stage production. Give it a chance, you may be pleasantly surprised!"
10.0,11 January 2020,"This film is extremely flawed: the pace is horrible, some faces look awful even when you have seen them for more than an hour and a half, every character looks as heck... But I think that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed.

You need to go to the cinema knowing that what you are about to watch is some real bad quality st, that's the most important thing. Then, I'd strongly recommend buying tickets for a session you know is going to be completely empty and going with some friends.

I did that and we spent the whole film shouting at the screen and pointing out dumb things and it was great.

All in all, the movie itself doesn't deserve a 6 at all but I gave it some extra points for the experience that came out of it!!"
10.0,2 January 2020,Life changing! Only gave it 10/10 because 11/10 wasn't an option. Word can't describe how spectacular this movie is!
10.0,21 December 2019,"Having seen both the stage show and this, I personally think it's a refreshing take on the story with a fairly strong cast. And despite what the internet is trying so hard to tell people (mostly kids seeking popularity points), no this movie is not 'scary' or 'nightmare fuel'. Far from it.

But, if you go into it with the mindset it is, or thinking you're gonna hate it, or thinking this or that actor is trash...you're probably gonna keep thinking it no matter what. But if you have an open mind and aren't seeking confirmation bias, I'd call it a good film to relax to."
10.0,20 December 2019,Simply amazing. Everything about this film is pure sensory ecstasy
9.0,25 December 2019,"Today I went to watch Cats and I enjoyed it very much. It is a pity that it was rushed into the theaters and some especial effects weren't finished. But I heard that it's being fixed with the new version.

Nonetheless it was a very nice experience for me, I already watched the musical live in Germany and the DVD and I really enjoy this musical.

Unfortunately lot of people don't like musicals, they hate movies where the actors sing instead of speaking.

If you enjoy musicals from broadway you will have a very nice experience. The singing, acting and dancing are incredible. And I like very much the idea of transforming the actors into cats.

So if you like musical theater I am sure that you will enjoy this movie very much. Don't listen to the haters and the YouTube reviews.

Musicals are not for everybody."
10.0,1 January 2020,"Picture this: A film adaptation of a musical that has an extremely divisive fanbase, either you love it or you hate it. The trailers gave off that terrifying vibe with CGI in place of costumes and makeup. I'm the kind of guy who will go out of his way to watch anything. And I mean ANYTHING. A lot of notoriously awful movie musicals fill my guilty pleasure void, from The Wiz, From Justin to Kelly and Spice World to The Pirate Movie, Grease 2 and Popeye. Cats is one more scratch in that bedpost.

One night every year, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles celebrate the Jellicle Ball, with their leader Old Deuteronomy (Dame Judi Dench) choosing one of them to ascend to the Heaviside Layer for a new life. What exactly happens once one moves on is left unclear, whether said cat dies on the way up above in a hot air balloon, but hey, it's a fantasy, roll with it. On this particular night of this particular unspecified timeline, a new arrival is abandoned by a human. This is Victoria (Royal Ballet principal Francesca Hayward in her feature film debut), a shy white kitten, quickly thrust into the world of the Jellicles.

She is introduced to each prominent member of the Jellicles by Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild) (a sort of narrator in the vein of the Bandleader from Chicago), from Gumbie cat Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), whose laziness is a front for her attempts to teach the creatures in her home how to work, and Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo), a picky, self-centered rebel, to Bustopher Jones (James Corden), a remarkably fat ""cat about town"", the troublemaking catburglar duo of Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer (Danny Collins and Naoimh Morgan) and the outcast Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), banished by the Jellicles for getting involved with the villainous Macavity (Idris Elba), a master criminal with supernatural abilities. Bombalurina (Taylor Swift), in this iteration, instead of being a Jellicle herself, is Macavity's henchwoman. Swift's performance with Macavity's song is the biggest praise most critics have given the film.

The visual effects are downright horrifying (I'm not entirely sure which version I've seen because I can't seem to find Dench's human hand), Jennyanydots removes her fur for a suit that's easier to dance in and she consumes cockroaches with human faces for no discernible reason. But I am a fellow who loves the uncanny valley, as well as the terrified noises of innocent audience members. Hell, my third trip resulted in my two friends leaving around the time of the obviously award-bait original song ""Beautiful Ghosts"" and then the theater erupted into a full-blown MST3K session.

In no way whatsoever is Cats a good movie nor will it be any kind of award contender (except maybe the Razzies because they seem to carelessly give the award to whatever's the most hated), but, beyond the initial terror you may get within the first twenty minutes, you can have a lot of fun riffing it. Surely there will be others in your theater who have the same idea."
10.0,9 January 2020,I actually really enjoyed this film. After reading all the negative reviews and not being a fan of the original musical I found this film surprisingly entertaining. Ok it's not perfect but theres some really fun songs which I thought were well sung and well arranged. I also enjoyed the fact that there was some sort of story to this film version.
10.0,1 January 2020,"My rating is based on how much I enjoy the film, not what I think of its quality.

Anyway this is such a bizarre film that it is almost impossible to not love on some level. There is no real story-even through the screenplay adds clear tension and an antagonist the stage show is lacking-and it is basically a series of vaudeville acts. Each cat sort of conforms to a stock character-i.e. the old actor, the fat comedian, tricksters etc. that performs a song. The songs very in quality but there are no clunkers. I am rather fond of Gus's song, ""Skimbleshanks"" and ""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer."" Unlike other Weber work the score has a wide scope and each song has its own feel. It doesn't add up to much. It is just some cheap sentiment and some laughs, but darn if ""Memory"" didn't convey some pathos and wasn't a tearjerker of a song.

Hooper does *a lot* better at staging the songs in this film than he did in Les Miserables. The camera is kept alive and there is no extreme close-ups. Likewise, cinematography, art direction are all top notch. I like that they kept the scale cat size but also grand. AND the film is appropriately art deco. I suspect this is best film, technically, you can derive from the stage show.

Now it is true that the costumes/CGI don't quite work. The faces bothered me far less than the hands. Also, I still don't understand why some cats had clothes on and some didn't. Eventually, about 10 minutes in, you get over the uncanny valley effect and you just sort of accept the bizarre world the film take place in. The hands distracted me throughout because claws came and went for some unknown reason.

I think the cast largely does about as well as anyone can do. Ian McKellen gives the *best* performance; he sings quite well. The Gus section is legitimately good. There is a bit of tonal clash because the various actors are treating the concept with different degrees of seriousness. Wilson, especially, seemed unwilling to buy into it. This just adds to the wonderful weirdness of the whole thing.

I think in time this film is going to be a campy classic."
10.0,2 January 2020,"First off let me say I'm very familiar with the original Cats stage production (I saw the Cats musical with the original cast in London in 1986, in Zurich in 1995 and in Toronto in 2019) so I have something to compare the movie with. I was baffled by the negative reviews since my husband and I loved the Cats movie!

Admittedly it differs in some aspects from the stage production. It's not entirely sung as the cats talk in between scenes and there is a slightly enhanced storyline. This made it in my opinion even more entertaining. I was not bothered by the fact that they switched one of the male cats (Old Deutoronomy) to a female cat in the movie. To me it was added value that they casted a principal ballerina as the lead (Victoria), which made for amazing dance scene. Jennifer Hudson's ""Memory"" was terrific. All the celebrities were highly enjoyable to watch. For everyone who loves the soundtrack of the Cats stage production, the music does not disappoint in the movie! It's very close to the original. Yes, the cats move, sing and dance in their furry suits and it made for a highly animated experience. What I also enjoyed in the movie is the set with the magical neon cityscapes, it was on a larger scale and more impressive than the stage.

I can't say there is one thing I disliked about this movie and I'll give it a 10/10. I hope people will give it a chance and not be deterred by the many bad reviews!"
8.0,28 December 2019,After going to see cats at the theatre was not disappointed. This was an amazing film which makes you feel up lifted. It was an amazing performance by all the cast. The make up and music was so awesome. Want to go and see it again.
8.0,6 January 2020,"I just don't get the hate. It's a very niche film - an old Lloyd Webber musical, based on old poems, about cats played by humans. It's nearly all singing, like a Lloyd Webber stage musical. If the above does not appeal you probably won't like this. The much maligned cat special effects are actually ok, you get used to it quickly. I enjoyed most of the performances. The songs remain good, the music was great though dated in some instances. The story is not complex, it's straight forward and doesn't spend too long explaining itself. It's the song's that make the show really, and the humour. It's a shame this movie has been so badly slated across the board as people who would have enjoyed it have been put off. I say give it a chance, it might surprise you."
9.0,4 January 2020,"CATS may not be a great film, but I found it to be as good or better than any movie musical I've seen in the last 5 years. I don't understand what the naysayers were expecting this to be. In this case, one appears to be sticking their neck out if they have the nerve to say something positive. I guess it's trendier to go with the crowd and bash it."
10.0,4 January 2020,"I can't understand all the negative reviews - I saw this with my wife and daughters, and we all thought it was brilliant. Maybe it helps if you've seen the stage version, then you'd understand that it wasn't originally conceived as a story as such - it was a series of poems by T.S. Eliott: ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" - so if you were expecting a clear storyline you would be disappointed. However, Andrew Lloyd Webber had woven them together along with the music to create a coherent whole. The film version breaks out of the confines of the stage into a wider Old London setting; the choreography and costumes make for a visual, even balletic, spectacle, with strands of humour, menace and pathos. Don't believe the rubbish reviews and the reviewers who don't know a good thing when they see it - go, see it, sit back and enjoy it!"
10.0,5 January 2020,"If you don't like this movie, you're probably a bore. What were you expecting of a show where people act like cats? It's weird, it's ""out there"". Maybe you need to do more psychedelics, so you can get a personality and appreciate this treat of a movie? Great sets, fun costumes (don't believe the reviews) amazing singing and dancing! The ear and tail choreography alone deserves an Oscar. Relax. Give in. Try being jellicle for awhile."
8.0,26 March 2020,"I was high hahaha. It made me emotional at one point, and I genuinely really enjoyed it. Honestly try watching it stoned it's a great experience! LOL"
10.0,25 December 2019,"I don't understand why this got so much hate. Everyone did a beautiful job, and the singing and dancing numbers were truly fantastic. If you don't like movie musicals, don't see it, but if you do, it's a great one."
10.0,21 December 2019,I thought it was a beautiful adaptation of the play. I have enjoyed the music and liked the play but the movie brought it to life for me and I better understand the story. Jennifer Hudson!
10.0,26 December 2020,"Saw this for the second time tonight and I loved it. Pure escapism and fantasy and great music. I saw Cats in London twice in the eighties and listened to the soundtrack through my childhood. It is probably my favourite musical and the big screen version does justice to my memories of the original stage performance. Sure, there are a few issues, but there are in most films. If you are prepared to suspend your disbelief and go with the world of the film then you will enjoy it. Would have given it nine stars due to the minor issues but actually giving it ten because of the haters calling it the worst film ever. It's really not, doesn't even come close."
10.0,21 October 2020,"I've never seen Cats live on Broadway. I had not the vaguest idea pertinent to the plot, but hot damn, I'm entertained. Im nearly alone on this rating, but here it is. Fun costumes, fun choreography, I'm having a great time."
10.0,23 January 2020,"I loved the move and I am not bot. I've seen the musical on stage back in the 80's (yeah, I'm old). I cried though the movie! I really loved it! JH and Memory, beautiful. Screens => Fantastic! and I found my new favourite song ""Mr Mistoffelies"" :) This one is sure worth to watch!"
9.0,28 December 2019,Don't understand the negative feedback of this Steven Kubrick masterpiece. It combines everything you loved about Star Wars The Revenge Of The Cats and Cats Vs Dogs to create a love filled creamy genius movie. The acting was sublime and Andrew Lloyd Webber gave a great performance as Meowski. The cat sex scene did feel a bit out of place in the film but it was necessary for the plot and (as me and my mother agree) very kinky! (I splooged) Ian McKellen was arguably one of the characters of the movie and as was Idris Elbow. Would give 10 stars if allowed. All of the negatively is from people who don't know good film and like rubbish like Pulp Fiction or The Dark Knight as appose to Masterpieces like Home Alone 5 or China Salesman. And in conclusion Mewo
9.0,18 April 2020,If you don't like this movie you've probably never seen the original
10.0,15 May 2020,"First things first: I loved the stage production in the Eighties and saw ""Cats"" multiple times. So I knew what to expect ""storywise"" and also that it is more or less just a character run through in musical form. And I had zero expectations watching the movie besides ""you will laugh about it"" and ""you wanna like it, but like everybody else, you will hate it, once you've seen it""...

Well: I didn't!

The effects were bad, that is true, but I could totally ignore that and have a good time. I think I can connect to the vision director Tom Hooper had, creating the movie version of that once beloved musical.

I liked the surreal scenery, the stage, the cinematography (I am serious), the choreography and, even if some acting was a bit shaky, some performances...

Some criticized the ""confusing"" jumps from one stage to the other but hey: movie-musicals do that since their beginning and a musical fantasy (and ""Cats"" clearly was and is that) has all the right to use those tools. The scene with Skimbleshanks the railway cat and the temporary cut to an ""outdoor setting"" was beautiful (and would've been even better with good FX). And it was done before and will be done later in musicals (TV or Film).

That the cats or the surroundings seemed once big, once small: for me that was not distracting, but an element of style that enhanced the surreal fantasy touch, Tom Hooper went for (at least it is my interpretation, that it was intentionally)

The songs were good as ever (just the new interpretation of ""Mungo Jerry and Rumpleteaser"" robbed this numbe of its original qualities).

Yeah, it had its flaws and one can focus on those and rip the movie apart, but overall it was an entertaining musical trip with a fair amount of cheesiness, but honestly: even the stage version is cheesy and fun because of that.

For me ""Cats - The Movie"" was a psychedelic trip with beloved songs and visuals (visuals that sadly were obviously plagued by unfinished SFX)

And yes: the oversexed way the cats were presented, felt very awkward at the beginning, but after a while I did not care anymore....Working with practical effects would've been a blessing. But it is how it is and we (my partner felt the same) had a good time watching it.

Btw

Don't take it so seriously! It is a musical FANTASY and what Jellicles are, well who cares. Maybe they are a cat gang on shrooms and the whole movie is a huge trip...

Jennifer Hudson, btw, is totally into it. Never saw a such an emotional interpretation of the Grizabella character ever before... She's giving it all!

I might be the only person in the world that loved and enjoyed it with all its flaws (besides my partner), but I seriously don't care.

Thanks Tom Hooper. I think your vision for it was a good and courageous movie experiment, that sadly bombed. You will recover. And who knows, maybe in a few years, the perception changes in some other people too..."
9.0,26 December 2020,"I absolutely loved cats - unique, magical, with spectacular characters and dance numbers. The body language and animation of the cats is so unique and you feel completely transported to another word.

The different cat characters are comical, emotionally complex, vulnerable, and charming. It's a beautiful piece of musical theater centered around the universal feeling of wanting to belong a community - I think that this must have gone over some people's heads, hence the bad reviews. I don't understand how many people hated this film - I watched twice in one day.

Additionally the casting was genuinely diverse, and not just tokenism - many of the lead characters were played by non- white actors from a variety of different performance backgrounds."
10.0,25 December 2021,"A lot of the reviews are talking about how these cats are human hybrids...would they say the same thing watching the Broadway version? The CGI reminds me of the Broadway makeup. Human noses on cat faces. It was nice to see the whiskers move, ears twitch and tails. If they had CGI the faces to be fully feline maybe those reviews wouldn't point out the human hybrid feel they seem to see.

I am a fan of the original version of Cats. I know the songs and have fond memories of being introduced to the music and the production. So I was wary about watching this because of the ratings, but looking at the reviews of those that gave it low ratings it seems most of them haven't seen the original and again go on about how these are hybrid creatures.

For the most part it does follow the versions from Broadway (one difference is that it takes place in various places not just in the junk yard) and it has just a few extra parts thrown in, which I think were a nice touch, it helped make this film its own. Then even with the numbers from Broadway they gave some of them their own twist which again was a nice touch. I enjoyed the magical Mr Mistoffelees scene.

When it came to Memories I don't think the signer did it justice, I was not moved by her performance it just seemed like she was trying to hard to sound sad. Maybe the voice was just to young sounding and didn't carry the power and presence behind it. She did have the ONE spot in the song that ALMOST touched on the original magic but for being such an iconic song from this show it just didn't do it justice which is sad.

All in all I found it to be a good version and Id watch it again and even recommend it."
10.0,8 December 2021,"I have seen Cats before on Broadway, and never really got why it was so popular - there was no comparison to Les Miserables or Phantom of the Opera. I saw the absolutely terrible reviews of this film here on IMDB and it was available on HBOMax so thought I just had to see the film to see what everyone was talking about. I was really pretty shocked after seeing this at how low the reviews are. The music is fantastic, the choreography was outstanding, the lighting and coloring was great, I thought all of the actors did a great job, and I thought that the CGI was very well done. I can't imagine the amount of work that this movie took, and I thought it had very high production quality. There are truly awful, cheap, poorly put together movies that rate much higher than this on IMDB. To Tom Hooper, thank you for making this movie!"
10.0,5 October 2021,This is better than most movie adaptations of Broadway shows. I really don't like the show Cats but I love the movie.
10.0,8 April 2020,"Cats was great, I guess. I am deaf and blind, so all I can honestly rate is the popcorn and Coke. Absolutely the best."
10.0,4 January 2020,"Well, I gave this movie 10/10 just to counter the mass stupidity in the other reviews who gave 1/10... Seriously? 1/10 - have you ever watched a movie that worth 1/10... but OK, enough for the simple minds - let's focus on the movie. It's actual rating should be around 7-8 of 10. It is a muscle with great choreography and fantastic music. It is not an Oscar candidate but hell, how emotional it could get (especially if you understand the message of abandonment and loneliness, not only for cats or other pets but also for people). I really love Memories as a song and it was always emotional on me but when it was performed in this movie I was fighting to stop my tiers (which is the effect they wanted to achieve) and only for this moment the movie earns its 10/10 score from me! And to all haters I would only say that I pity you, simple minded people!"
10.0,27 December 2019,"I thought it was great. Cats is a musical, that's why it seems there is no plot, but it is through music and song and performance that the plot written. Can't see why people don't like this but then like the avengers.. wtf is wrong with the world"
8.0,20 December 2019,"The awesome thing about the musical Cats was the mix of dance and acrobatics of varying disciplines depicting feline physicality. The CGI reduces instead of enhances this but the movie still will be a classic favorite due to extraordinary dance performances of Stephen McRae and Francesca Hayward as well as exquisite singing by Taylor Swift, Jason Derulo and Jennifer Hudson, and the accomplished acting of literally nobles Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen. Choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler (Hamilton) and directed by Tom Hooper (Les Mis), there is a huge array of high caliber talent here in this Film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats. It all started with some TS Elliott poems..."
10.0,23 December 2019,"23 December 2019 Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Cats. I believe I'm going to buck the trend here. I loved this film. I loved that I knew all the words, that we got the sort of close ups of the cats that you never would in a stage show, enabling you to get the nuances of the characters, every twitch of the whisker every shake of the ear and every twitch of the tail. There was so much to focus on in every scene the film fair skipped along. I think the casting of so many famous people was a great thing. Who knows how many of them dreamed that one day they might play a jellicle cat, and with extended theatre runs being to costly in time for the actors we got to see people attack very different roles with gusto. I particularly liked Idris Elba as Macavity. Good to see James Cordon and Rebel Wilson portrayed as the larger felines and Sir Ian McKellen as Gus The Theatre Cat was very moving. My favourite song has always be Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat and I was eagerly awaiting this scene, I wasn't disappointed, I have a passion for tap and to see that incorporated along the train tracks was great. At the end of the film I heard someone say that Dame Judy Dench was dreadful, the only dreadful thing was her costume, compared to all the others she looked like she was clothed in fur fabric. She was an old lady playing an old cat and it worked for me. A great score, glorious sets and some beautiful choreography, don't kill the messenger but I loved it."
9.0,28 December 2019,"Fabulous throughout. Beautiful dancing by abandoned cat Victoria (ballerina Francesca Hayward). Wonderful original songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber and a stunning song co written with Taylor Swift. Loved it. Jennifer Hudson's rendition of ""Memory"" is a tear jerker. All cast wonderful. Give it a go and just enjoy the beauty and spectacle of it all. Jellicle cats for me!!"
10.0,22 January 2020,"Honestly shocked by the hate. The movie looked weird? Okay sure, it's a little odd to see people with CGI cat bodies and yes they could have been better done perhaps but is it really ""horrifying""? It was a little jarring at first but I quickly got used to it. The singing, dancing choreography etc were excellent. This isn't a typical movie you take your kids to see for fun. It is based on a broadway musical and should be approached as art. Shocking perhaps but also beautiful."

10.0,27 December 2019,"I'm so confused about the bad reviews for this film. The movie is a masterpiece. Ok, if you weren't a fan of the original Cats musical and don't like the songs or storyline, then you might well have a problem with this film. But for a remake of the Cats musical, it's utterly beautiful and so well done. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to dance and sing along. Give this movie a chance, don't be put off by bad reviews."
10.0,23 December 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. Magical and beautiful. I took it for what it was and didn't have any expectations especially after the critics grabbed it a hard time. There was comedy, there was amazing dancing, and splattering of stars. Loved it."
10.0,28 December 2019,"I find the negative reviews of this film to be absolutely appalling. Only cultured people will extract the full experience which this film's creator intended. There's a deeper, more side that only intellectuals will understand. Don't be afraid.... snatch up your feline pal and head over to your local theater as soon as possible."
10.0,24 December 2019,"The film was amazing. It's sad to see so many negative reviews for such a beautiful film. The music, acting, choreography, and plot was extraordinary. The cast looks like cats which seems to be taken negatively? I enjoyed the CGI and details the film had. If anyone knows anything about the original Cats then they would understand the lack of an overall plot. The movie stays true to the original production and takes you into a new world. Overall one of the best movies of 2019, no matter what it's reviewed."
10.0,27 December 2019,"I feel it's a fun movie and yes although a long film and a lot of singing, what did you guys expect with a musical? Go in with an open mind and with the magic of it all, it's a beautiful story and so fun. It's quirky and weird but that's what CATS is all about anyway. Mint, would watch again."
10.0,23 December 2019,"I read a lot of the reviews indicating this was a poor movie. A little research would have given these reviewers a basis for understanding Webber's interpretation of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. People just want everything handed to them and if it is not they try to blame others. Cats had the great music of Webber and well choreographed dancing. The cast started looking like cats quickly. I agree this is not for everyone, but movie buffs should consider a movie on the merits of acting, singing, and choreography."
10.0,2 January 2020,"It's cats, I think the critics have been extremely harsh about it!"
10.0,1 January 2020,"I feel extremely angry with all the unfair bad reviews out there which now, after having watched the film, don't make any sense really ... and I can understand the critics as they are paid not to give an honest opinion but to push forward their own agendas and play the politics of the film industry, by supporting one film while trashing another one ... but the general public I honestly don't understand its naivety and how easily it is manipulated by the sold out media!

For what it counts, my partner and I looooooved it!!"
10.0,24 December 2019,"I was hesitant to see the movie after reading the reviews. But I I loved it!! The music is Andrew Lloyd Webber at his best! I saw my Own cats in the mannerisms of the actors, the movement of their tails and ears, their nuzzling, and even the hisses. Francesca Hayward as Victoria is beautiful as she gracefully navigates the world of Jellicle Cats. And Dame Judi Dench adds her wisdom and elegance. Admittedly, the movie requires a bit of imagination, a belief in magic and a bit of whimsey, all in distressingly short supply these days. I am a Cats lover!!!"
10.0,3 January 2020,This movie is just so good in almost every aspect. You can just tell that everyone involved put their entire heart into it and the result was well worth it. Everyone on the team that had even the smallest thing to do with this masterpiece should be so proud and feel so accomplished. Not to mention how adorable the cats are with the crazy good CGI. A masterpiece if I ever saw one.
8.0,29 December 2019,If you like the show you will love this movie. I am presuming that the people reviewing the film do not know the stage show. The plot is simple. It is based on the poems of TS Elliott describing various cats . What's not to get. The music is awesome especially Memory . Loved it all
9.0,27 December 2019,"I was very worried about taking my 6 & 9 year old daughters to see this following so many poor reviews, however, we all absolutely loved it!!! The songs were great, fantastic dancing & the story was surprisingly easy to follow!!! They both want to be Victoria now & can't stop listening to the sound track. Ignore the negative reviews & make up your own mind!!!! 🐾🐾🐾🐾🐾"
10.0,30 December 2019,"We watched the movie Cats Sunday and were hugely entertained. I've since read any number of reviews of the film and they are all negative and I can't see why. For that reason I'm writing this review.

First I'll mention the films weakness, in my opinion. Dame Judy Dench, Idris Elba, and Sir Ian McKellen (likely the three biggest names in the show) really don't have the vocal chops.

The point of a musical is to enjoy the singing, the dancing, the choreography, and the set designs. Even the weakest singing (as mentioned above) was more than adequate. Taylor Swift did a great job singing about Macavity - and I'm not a fan of hers. However Jennifer Hudson stole the show (singing wise) as Grizabella and her rendition of Memories was the best I've ever heard. As good as the singing was the dancing was absolutely out of this world with special note going to Steven McRae (Skimbleshanks) for his tap dancing and Francesca Hayward (Victoria) who totally carried the show on her paws. There were a too many entertaining bits to mention, but we found the whole movie absolutely wonderful and entertaining.

As cat owners we were even entertained by the movement of the ears and tails - how they did this... (CGI?)

Just a totally wonderful way to spend an afternoon - much better than watching lasers and things blow up..."
10.0,5 January 2020,This movie was fantastic! I highly recommend you take a person that you HATE!
8.0,22 December 2019,"I'm baffled at the vehemence of the bad reviews for this, yes Clearly if you don't love musicals or cats you'll struggle but if you want a visual feast, knowingly camped up performances from a stellar cast and some beautiful dance & musical numbers this is a winner. It's true it's not the most complex of stories, it is from poetry after all - it's more a series of set pieces - However it's charming and touching and j hud knocks memories out of the park. If you want 2 hours of uncomplicated feline based entertainment I heartily recommend it"
8.0,26 December 2019,"I just came back from the theatre. The movie was incredible. I don't know why most of the people are moaning about. It's obviously that is a musical. If you don't like musicals just don't watch it! ""Memories"" is a classic song and ""Beautiful ghosts"" is more than amazing! The actors, the dance, the costumes were amazing! I enjoyed every minute of it. This movie desirves part two."
8.0,26 December 2019,I don't understand all of the bad press or reviews. I went and watched the movie and understood that it was slow at the beginning but become more aware of the plot. Really enjoyed the movie and has a great cast.
8.0,26 December 2019,
10.0,21 January 2020,"We have to consider what kind of film we are dealing with before reviewing it.

Considering it as a musical performing by cats with human aspect and a weird and magical plot (like everything in cats´s world) it is a very interesting and beautiful film.

Highly recommended for cat lovers and people who love beautiful songs and musical films. Very emotional. Do not pay attention and discard its unfair and incomprehensible general raiting."
10.0,13 June 2023,"Before seeing Cats, I had heard all of the dreadful reviews and they made me laugh so much I wanted to see the movie for myself. A sidenote is that I get a kick out of watching bad movies, and often even find myself enjoying them in unironic ways.

When I finally saw this movie, I was dazzled. It reminded me of a surrealistic take on the classic MGM musicals of the 40s. And this is why most people hated it, in my opinion-because surrealism is not for everyone.

I, on the other hand, adore it. In my opinion, Fellini was at his best in the 70s, when most critics thought he'd gone off the deep end (I can't stand his neo-realistic works, but I love his later stuff like Casanova). Henry Jaglom is my favorite filmmaker of all time. I think Popeye was Robert Altman's best film. Caligula is a surrealistic masterpiece to me.

I mention these other works to give you an idea of where I stand on cinema. My opinions are likely unpopular with many audiences and critics, and films like the ones I love often fail to find their audiences. Cats is one of them.

So what was the ideal audience for this film? It should not appeal to Broadway fans, but rather to people like me that love when movies show a world distorted by surrealism.

Of course, surrealism, at its best, isn't about distorting the world-it's about showing the audience something about the real world that clarifies it for us, but in a way that we would never have thought of ourselves. That's what's magical about it, and that's what was magical, to me, about Cats."
10.0,26 December 2019,"I thought I'd check it out despite the terrible reviews, thinking people are just hating it for fun.. and actually enjoyed the movie! After not being a fan of the actual live production, I enjoyed the big screen remake. Some of the cgi was annoying at the beginning but I stopped noticing it because I was enjoying the movie so much. The music is the best part of this movie, the modern twist on the classic soundtrack is awesome. Memory was performed amazingly and was a real stand out for me. If you are a musical lover, go and give this movie a go!"
10.0,27 December 2020,"The negative reviewers either want to ""fit in"" with the narrative, or have a narrow imagination (or are the much rarer statistically expected genuine negative reviewers). I don't doubt that the majority of them watched (if they even bothered going that far) for the sole reason of leaving a negative review.

I get it, musicals translated to film aren't for everyone - but you more-or-less know what you're getting in to on that one. Once you're self aware enough to realise this isn't a sci-fi fantasy or crime thriller, and is about the story of some cats, you'll be well on your way to enjoying this film more. The hilarious number of negative reviews that are basically ""oh my god, there are CGI cats in this movie!"" - I dunno, maybe at least give the title of films you're going to watch a read through - seriously, it's four letters, you managed to bung together a couple of sentences for a disingenuous one-star review, yet still somehow, amazingly, failed to take account that you were watching a film called ""Cats"". It's just lazy to write a negative review saying the ""storyline had no structure"" when you're so dazzled to distraction by CGI cats that you fail to understand what must be one of the more obvious storylines in a musical (although it does require you to listen to the lyrics and actually pay attention to the film).

It's important to understand the above in consideration of the reviews, because, all told, this is a relatively charming and certainly quite faithful recreation of the stage show (to those unaware, it's a phenomenally successful theatre show running for decades to packed and satisfied audiences).

To set some context, I am a big fan of the musical and have seen it a few times in the West End, along with the filmed stage recording. And, if you're at all like me, and are slightly scared of watching this film for fear of ruining your enjoyment of the musical itself - watch it. It's not ""just"" not bad, it's pretty good.

It's visually pleasing with its twilight neon-lit cobbled street settings, albeit somewhat more desaturated to a comparable predecessor such as Moulin Rouge. It's absolutely packed with well known actors - who I am sure all signed up due to a love of the musical. Not a reason to like the film by itself, but taken at face value each of their performances feels like they've poured their soul into it. It can be nothing short of heartbreaking to have what is clearly a labour of love to be destroyed by the whims of people too easily influenced by right-think. I would concur with the film's major disappointment being the rendition of ""Memory"" given to us, but all told it had a lot to live up to.

In short: watch it, especially if you get it included with whatever you're already subscribed to - that's what I did. I just hope that it really does enjoy some success in the future when a generation of more independent thinkers emerges, and takes a film called ""Cats"" at face value and opens their imagination enough to accept that the film might just feature, yes: cats."
8.0,21 December 2019,"Ignore the bad ratings. There is nothing like a remake of the original Cat's, which debuted in New York in 1954. I think this one compares to anything Scorcese has done and forget, just for a minute, where this movie will be in 100 years. I am sure that there will be many many sequels spawned and since a 2.7 isn't a zero rating? Give it a try. The moment I sat down in the theater, with plenty of room to move around, I was entranced by the overall experience. I didn't pay enough to see this masterpiece! I want to thank the director and actors for delivering the one-two punch of an Oscar-worthy picture that you won't soon forget. Cats gets a 10/10 from this cat."
8.0,27 December 2019,Best cats movie. You should watch this movie. There is no other movie like this.
10.0,26 December 2019,"A great insight into the life of cats, best cat movie to be made, a truly exquisite piece of cinema!"
10.0,5 January 2020,"If you loved the musical, you will love the movie. The music and dance numbers are great. The cast is spot on. You just need to remember they are playing cats which I realize is not an easy task. I throughly enjoyed it and am glad I ignored critics!"
10.0,8 January 2020,Unpopular opinion but I really liked Cats. The thing about this movies is that you have to understand that this came from musical theatre WHICH YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU WATCH THIS!!! Otherwise of course you would think this is weird. In musical theatre kind of anything goes and the actors are mimicking the behaviors of cats which might make some people uncomfortable by once you get past that the plot is unique and the dancing and singing is wonderful.
10.0,9 January 2020,"I don't understand why everyone is complaining about this movie. No, it's not packed with action or a mind bending plot. But neither was the Broadway show. This musical was very true to the original with great singing & dancing. The CGI as well as the actors movements were well done in my opinion. The ear pivots & head butting was cat-like. None of it was disturbing or nightmarish as others had stated. Stop complaining! Just enjoy this show for what it's supposed to be, a light hearted musical about a lovely group of cats!"
10.0,4 January 2020,
9.0,24 December 2019,"Loved it! The way this film has been put together is stunning. The costumes and animation of the cats features, like the ears and tail movement, is captivating. The scenery is beautiful and when Jennifer Hudson sings 'Memory' it just takes your breath away. I reckon the negative reviews on here are from people who do not realise that 'Cats' is a musical ballet, based on a quirky TS Elliott poem book. If one was expecting a 'normal' film, there could be some confusion. We loved it and believe it to be an amazing adaptation of the stage show. Just beautiful."
10.0,2 January 2020,This film said a lot about our society. I believe this film receives too much hate. Some people just don't understand the deep philosophy of CATS! UwU
10.0,2 January 2020,Beautiful version! Jennifer Hudson was phenomenal!!!
10.0,29 December 2019,"I have been a fan of the theatre production of Cats since I was a child! Despite the bad reviews I've read I was still eager to see the film! The films was fantastic! Yes the CGI was a bit strange at times but the story flowed, the music was amazing (the added new song is already stuck in my head) and the dancing did not disappoint!!

Please don't be put off by the bad reviews this film has had, if you are a fan of the theatre production you will absolutely love the film!"
10.0,23 December 2019,Great version of the classic MUSICAL! all the bad reviews have obviously never seen the actual musical!
10.0,20 October 2020,"The Broadway production has the same storyline as the movie. HavIng enjoyed the live Broadway stage production first, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the movie. The talent and movie sets were awesome."
9.0,14 July 2020,"Seriously, I think it's sad that no one else's review here that I have read saw what I saw. I had never seen any other Cats production before so maybe that's one reason why I was able to watch it without comparing it to some other production. I thought the beauty of using a cast of true actors was genius because the emotions were important to the story and it's important to get good actors who can properly convey those emotions to the audience. Jennifer Hudson, Judi Dench, the actor who plays Mr. Mistofelees, to name just a few, these actors truly convey not only the emotions needed to tell their stories but also really got into the minds of cats and convey through their movements the quirky attitudes of cats. And I thought it was brilliant to let Rebel Wilson and James Corden be funny. It was great! I loved this movie. Most movies I can't watch more than once, but this one I see myself watching it several times, at least. I also thought the costumes and cgi to enhance them with catlike movements were brilliant. Thanks for making it!"
10.0,1 January 2020,"So.....
some simple, fun, frivolous but excellent poems by TS Elliot were turned into a simple, fun, frivolous but excellent stage play (that many critics maligned for being too shallow, for its costumes and for the way that it portrayed cats in human form).
and now, its a simple, fun, frivolous but excellent film (and the critical backlash is abnormally high because of social media and the collective 'fun' of jumping on bandwagon of negativity).


Ignore the reviews, ignore the critics and if you like West End musicals go and see it with a open mind, understanding its a combination of superb dance and excellently sung musical numbers. Its still a simple, fun and frivolous thing, but in that context its a wonderful, magical couple hours of entertainment that I enjoyed with three generations of my partners family."
10.0,17 April 2020,"This cinematic piece of history has changed my life. My depression has disappeared, I have a spring in my step, I don't want to drink the arsenic anymore. I no longer think of reaching for my gun. All my thoughts of death have been replaced by dancing cockroaches, Gandalf hissing, James Corden's gutter alley feast, and Taylor Swift... oh my. This is a true source of relief for anyone during these troubling times. And the only way to spend one's self-isolation."
10.0,20 June 2020,"Lots and lots of bad reviews on this one from production, effects and poor acting. I've just watched the movie with an open mind and enjoyed the movie from start to finish, runs very quickly, great performances all round, effects were great and the $100 million budget certainly can be seen on screen. I'm not a fan of this director, but the film does deliver here, more due to an excellent cast of well experienced and very good young upcoming stars. Younger children may find it a little unsettling as the cats can be quite forceful at times. A must see for musical lovers !!!!"
10.0,23 August 2020,"I know it isnot the populair opinon, but I think Cats is a masterpiece. Totaly unique and well executed vision. It's a dance movie in the first place. So the story unfolds on a more abstract level. This gives the director complete freedom to roam where ever he wants to go. Each song gets its own treatment so there is not much for the more conservative viewer to hold on to. Just let go en enjoy the great dancing, beautiful imagery and weird cat people. It's pure fantasy

Don't believe the haters. Have a beer (or two) and watch it for yourself. It will become a cult classic!

10!"
10.0,1 January 2020,"This movie does not deserve to be panned.

I found it quite beautiful. You have to know it is an adaptation from a musical which was inspired by a quirky collection of poems about cats.

I think maybe a lot of reviewers didn't understand this. And I didn't think it was fair that many walked out after 30 mins or 1 hour and still felt within their rights to leave a review.

There are some changes from the original musical to give it more of a plot but essentially it is a song and dance spectacle. I found it entertaining and moving and it gave those familiar with Cats a different angle on the work.

It is not a masterpiece, the CGI may be wanting, but if you go into the movie with an open mind, I don't see why one can't enjoy it. Frances Hayward and Jennifer Hudson were amazing in their roles and the other cast members were good too.

I can see why some people were uncomfortable with it. The musical didn't really have speaking in it. The plot isn't immediately apparent. It is definitely not your typical Hollywood movie. But I think people are too quick to diss what they're not used to."
8.0,7 June 2023,"I wanted to love this movie, but in the first three seconds of watching it, I started throwing up massive hairballs. I thought that it was a sign that I belong to the cats so I found the cats and I started laying on my head and coughing up massive hairballs. It was so fun. I was on my way home I saw a sign that said cats are stinky and ratty. I took it as a sign to eat all of the cats, and coughed them out like a hairball. You may be asking why my headlines says stinky cats sing about death. It's because I ate them and they died while singing. I am now officially a 87-year-old cat with a full belly of screaming cat people inside of it. I have to give the cats movie a 10 out of 10. It is truly beautiful and you will die if you don't see it."
10.0,21 December 2019,"If you loved the musical, you'll love this! If you're not familiar with it, listen to the music and read the T.S. Elliot poems it's based on. It is really well acted, sung, and danced. Google the synopsis of the original musical if you are confused."
10.0,26 December 2019,
9.0,29 December 2019,Just come back from watching Cats. Glad I didn't go with the critics. It was an amazing experience. If you saw the original show on the stage which I think a lot of people haven't you will know exactly what to expect and it delivers. Judy Dench. Wow! Ian Mckellen. Wow! Nobody duff at all. Jennifer Hudson. Goosebumps!! With Memory. Can't recommend it enough. If you love musical theatre you will love it. If you don't. You won't. Simple as that!!
8.0,24 December 2019,"I am an broadway obsessed person and i have seen the stage version and today i saw the movie, and i can assure that the stage version is the same, boring and with a weird and missing plot it is basically a trip, but it is a classic and the music is majestic! Sure the world did not needed a cats movie but they gave it yo us and honestly it wasn't that bad! The cgi was creepy asf but live in a theatre was it sure was from a nightmare too hahaha.

The cast was a CHOICE but it wasn't horrible, except Rebel Wilson, overall i really liked it! And y'all are a bunch of cry babies who haven't seen the stage version and it shows!"
10.0,20 December 2019,"I don't know why there are so many awful reviews on here? My daughter and I really enjoyed it. We've never seen the musical and it was exactly what I expected, if you don't like musicals don't go see it! Loved Judi Dench and Ian Mckellen playing the old moggies 🐈"
8.0,25 December 2019,"I don't understand what people are complaining about.The costumes are realistic and great.If you go and see the theatre version it their suits are the same .If you do not know the story,the action of the movie,anything about the theatre version and the original movie from the 80's then don't leave any comments.This is not just any kind of movie this is Cats."
8.0,1 February 2020,"An epic film. Cats singing, if you like cats and like music this is the perfect film for you. Has some great Oscar worthy performances. It should clear up at the Oscars."
10.0,20 December 2019,I loved every second. Get out and see this film now
10.0,13 January 2020,"I'm getting a feeling IMDB reviews might be becoming payed trolls of competing studios.. How can we understand the hate this movie received? Creepy cat/people? You've seen the trailer - why did you go and see it then? Why did any of non musical lovers, or specifically non Cats lovers go see this movie? Just to write bad comments? On Broadway and elsewhere it was musical number one for ages. And now the nice movie adaptation is trash? There's no story? Is there less story than there was on the stage? You can perceive it as a day in a cat's life..

I think the songs performances were great (ok, I knew them since childhood), cats visuals were great, scenes were great, whole experience was great, sometimes also emotional. It's a worthy movie adaptation to a blockbuster musical, that won't age. Go see it if you're a curious cat, ignore the Avengers mainstream audience comments (or employees of other studios!)"
10.0,31 December 2019,"Never seen the musical but my wife is a big fan. Went to watch with my wife and daughter, and I loved it. Great catchy tunes good casting and excellent dancing. Maybe not a 10 but don't agree with the low score so gave it a 10. Maybe more an 8"
10.0,25 December 2019,"First of all, I have never seen the stage production of Cats, but I was entertained by the movie and that's what I go to a movie for! If you don't know the story of Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, I suggest you read it beforehand, it will make the characters easier to relate to. The music is good, the costuming is eye-catching and the dancing is outstanding. Jennifer Hudson's ( Grisabella) rendition of ""Memory"" brought tears to my eyes and as a singer who dislikes this song, because it is generally sung badly, Hudson nails it! Maybe go on dollar night if you're not sure if you'll like it or wait for video release"
10.0,9 January 2020,"I saw all the hate in the internet and now decided to also write a review. I went to watch cats because my friend persuaded me. I left the cinema with mixed feelings and a new celebrity crush. No, but honestly, sure cats isn't the best movie that was ever shot, nor does it have the best acting performances in the world, but still it is made with incredibly much heart and appreciation of the old musical. The actors are so passionate about their roles that it's impossible not to adapt this feeling. My suggestion for seeing the movie is, to go in without expectations, so you'll just be surprised of what comes. Of course it's weird at some parts, but take it humourously. It was supposed to be that way. The dancing is great! All the choreographies are just awesome! Maybe with the exception of Jennyanydots... She kinda sent even me to chills, but hey, just have a good laugh about it. But in turns, Laurie Davidson as Misto is just so awesome!!!!!!! And Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo do a better job than I had expected them to. Judi Dench IS awesome too, so is Ian McKellen! So, I give it a 9/10."
8.0,14 September 2020,I have never laughed at a movie so much in my life thank you for making this
8.0,28 April 2021,"It was everything I hoped for and more. Having grown up in the theater and done theater myself it was a 1st class cast, music and scenery! Definitely a feast for all the senses."
8.0,10 January 2020,"I could'nt be more happy and delirious with this crazy movie. I love it so much!!!! I grew up listening to the music, i knew all of it, i watch the play all over again. I was so THRILLED to hear the music at the Cinema! It sounds so GREAT!! - And i actually must admit that the moral of the ""story"" is more deep and interesting here than in the play. The purists may hate some of the changes, but it could it be worst. it could be animated (that would be so much of a mistake, even if the animation was intended to be quailty).

In the last 15 years you have eaten the worst of the CGI for the sake of the fantasy in way awful movies. Don't come here and cry because of it because the music, the actors and the art design does'n t deserves it. The music and sound mix is wild! It's a real pity (and stupid thing to do) to retire the film from Oscar nominations. This is real Art, not that La, La Crap you have liking at all this years."
10.0,29 September 2021,"Very similar to the musical which I loved. Apart from the hands, they did a fantastic adaptation to the screen. Will never beat the musical, but this is the next best to seeing it live."
10.0,11 September 2021,"I think that there's something wrong with me . I LOVE this movie ! I don't understand why about 97% of the planet seems to loathe it . You don't watch this movie as much with your eyes and ears , but with your heart . It's a wonderful, surrealistic slide down the rabbit hole! I don't understand half of it, and I don't care ! It's funny, it's poignant, it's a ride ! The only ones who could not absolutely love this journey are those without a soul . Is that you ?"
8.0,1 January 2020,"To all the people who gave this film one star, might I remind you of Willy Wonka's line... ""Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination!"" Hard to believe that so many people have lost their ability to imagine something beyond their narrow, dull lives. Perhaps because I saw the musical live on Broadway, I came in with no expectations except to see a filmed version of the musical. And make no mistake, that's what this is... a film of a musical with people pretending to be cats. The story line is very simple... the cats gather together one night of the year to compete to see who gets to be reborn into a new life. The lucky cat is chosen by old Deuteronomy and ascends to the ""Heaviside Layer."" End of story.

All the people who said the trailer (and the film) were ""weird"" and ""creepy"" - you really need to get over yourselves. Sure, Tom Hooper could have just had the cast members dress in cat costumes. Instead he used CGI techniques to make them look more like cats. I never - for one second in the almost two hours of this film - thought the cats looked like anything more than people ""dressed up"" to look like cats. The CGI work was excellent. The set design, staging and choreography were all well done, as was most of the singing. Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't write that many great songs, most are just passable. In this show, almost all of the songs are character driven and the set pieces were creatively imagined by Hooper and his crew.

The only reason I didn't rate this a 9 or 10 is that I found some of the editing (especially in the dance sequences) was distracting. Oh, and I didn't like all the close-ups of Jennifer Hudson singing ""Memory"", although she did a very good job. (I still prefer Elaine Page's version.)

So, to sum up... Imagination, people, Imagination! Or have you forgotten what that is?"
9.0,2 April 2022,"But a nice surprise. Rebel Wilson is a star, she plays a cat so well. So funny girl. Love her. And the singing was great, the Rum Rum cat wooow.

I love how they do high pitches with tails up. Well thought. Nicely done. Has a story also that you can keep up with through the music. Great. The scene where is filmed reminds me of the darkness in Moulin Rouge. And it fits amazingly.

Great."
8.0,29 April 2020,I rented this is gonna be horrible but actually after watching it was nice it was a beautiful filmed movie and look like it a lot of time to create I loved the play and I think they did a good job reenacting of the characters with a lil bit of twist It was a really good movie overall amazing I didn't like is that there is not that much lines but it's hey beautiful movie with beautiful actors I don't understand all of the hate The music is beautiful! Overall I really like the movie. And wish people liked it more
10.0,4 April 2020,"Cats has always been my favorite musical! When I saw the film, I was amazed by the sets, the music and the songs. It really took me beyond the junkyard! In fact, I understand if the people who worked on the film wanted to do something new with Cats. Who knows, maybe Tom Hooper can make a film adaption of Starlight Express as well someday!"
9.0,11 April 2020,"Look...No matter how you see Cats the first time you're going to leave scratching your head a bit. Is that really a show that's basically boils down to an 'out-of-towner' wanders into an alley and is thrust into a talent show of old cats who are auditioning to earn a chance to go to heaven. That's it. That's literally the whole story.

So if you know that going in, and just relax, watch the pretty colors and listen to the mostly average songs then you'll at least not hate the movie.

Realistically, the movie is a 6 or 7 but I'm giving it a 10 to offset the idiots giving it a 1. Of course Cats has no storyline....it never did! Of course actors are not amazing singers. The CGI is quite awful and distracting though..."
8.0,11 October 2020,
10.0,9 July 2021,"I was not a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Cats' when it was such a huge success so many years ago, so I was not expecting much from this movie (especially after the scathing reviews it received upon its released); however, I was pleasantly surprised when I tuned in and watched this movie version on cable.

The first thing that grabbed me was the music. It had been thirty years since I had heard those songs (apart from the ubiquitous 'Memory'), and they are great. The music is just wonderful and it jogged my memory in a very nice way.

The costumes are a bit creepy at first, but, once I got over it, I liked the look of the whole production. Much like the show, the dancing cats inhabit a stylized London alley, but, unlike the show, some of the songs take place in locations that suit their individual stories.

If you are a cat lover, you are likely to see an old friend among this group of T. S. Elliott's 'Practical Cats'.

I think the failure of this movie is timing. If 'E. T' were to be released today, it would probably be greeted with the same pretentious cynicism that greeted this movie."
9.0,11 January 2020,"The reviews for this movie are so harsh and I really don't understand. This is the best movie I've seen in a long time and I'm very critical of movies but this was a masterpiece. The music, the choreography, the acting. Words fall short for how good this movie. The ending brought tears to my eyes, the songs gave me chills. Everyone who worked on this movie did an amazing job I've seen it 4 times and I will be seeing it again tomorrow."
10.0,26 December 2019,"Not sure why everyone is giving it 1 star. It was a good musical and yes is different from the play.... but it's a MOVIE adaption they can do what they want!!

I LOVED it and would recommend seeing it!!"
9.0,21 December 2019,"How can you possibly say this film was bad? I found it delightful and magic. I think AaronKyle1998 must have watched a different film than we did, or perhaps he just likes John Wayne films. He has NO taste"
10.0,31 December 2019,"My friend and I viewed CATS today (12/30/19), expecting an awful movie, thanks to movie critics' negative reviews. Not surprising, the theater was near-empty. At the end we turned to each other and said, ""That was good!"" ""I liked it a lot!"" It's a musical, it has dancing and singing. Is that the problem? The story flows easily from beginning to end. The costumes (with moving ears and tails) aren't creepy. Maybe we saw the edited version?"
10.0,1 January 2020,"First of all, I'm just gonna put it out there, y'all are wrong. I've never been so blown away by the amazing CGI of cats, mean I am cat lover and regularly adopt stray cats and acquire associated home furnishings. Mean who doesn't want cat plates and stuffed long passed family members? Anyways I'm straying off topic. Who's idea was to insert Taylor Swift? She is the song bird of our generation. I really do hope she gets a supporting actor now, hopefully Kanye isn't in the room! I really just wish people will go back with an open mind of how this movie has opened my eyes to cinema. Jacob, my local police department sergeant really had his eyes opened. He's usually ""oh hell naww"" etc to musicals, he's more a Rocky type but even he couldn't hold back them tears. Do yourself a favor, jump on this movie and grab your best friend, bring tissues and you won't regret it."
10.0,21 December 2019,"If it wasn't for some issues with CGI, I would say this is just as good as the musical. Great depth to characters and Explanation of the movie throughout. Having Victoria as the main character and basing it around her... genius. Update of all of the songs And the characters really made it their own. A lot of well known names although happy that they weren't really main characters as the less known actors were much better. Absolutely loved the movie and just made me want to see the musical again. Unpopular opinion but I absolutely loved it!!"
10.0,18 October 2020,"So here it goes for those individuals that gave a bad rating to this movie: Unfortunately, there are people in this world that completely lack fantasy and who are not able to think outside the box... This movie is great, funny, sexy, sweet. And with Victoria there is an added storyline added to the masterpiece of that genius who is Andrew Lloyd Webber. I gave it a rating of 10 to compensate for the inexplicable bad ratings. In reality it deserves at least an 8, I did not like at all the performance of Jennifer Hudson, there are far better depictions of ""Memory"" out there..."
10.0,27 December 2019,"If you go into this movie understanding that it's a musical ballet, then you won't be disappointed. I'm not a fan of either genre but i stayed and enjoyed it and even cried at the end. And im a middle aged straight single white dude."
10.0,11 January 2020,"Based on the reviews I was a little apprehensive having loved the stage production that I saw in London's West End years ago. I'm guessing the vast majority of negative reviews are from uncultured individuals who have no appreciation of musical theater. The costumes were fantastic, the cat mannerisms captured were spot on, and the emotion evoked in song was stunning."
8.0,30 December 2019,"Ever since I saw the trailer I wanted to see this movie and I'm glad I did. I was drawn in from the start. It looks georgious. So much detail, and the cats are the best. I don't think those haters even botherd to see for them self. It's not about the story, it's about the music, which tells the story. The end, when Dame Judy Dench talks directly into the camera is so beautifull. It made me want to go to the shelter and take a cat home with me. I went on a monday afternoon and the theatre was slimst full. People who want to see it will go, also if you are dog people."
9.0,30 December 2019,I think that the dances and make up was awesome and I have always loved Cats! I have seen it in London and NY! James Corden made it all worth the while! The director added his own flair to it which is what they do best and did a great job on the movie!!
8.0,27 December 2019,"Most of the negative reviews are, I'm sure from people who don't understand the backstory and where this movie came from. While it wasn't perfect, it was entertaining and beautifully performed!"
8.0,21 December 2019,"And he loved every frame of it. No spoilers. Go see this. If you're sensitive, it'll get a reaction out of you."
8.0,30 December 2019,I actually watched this movie twice. It actually helped me understand it more the second time. But the songs were great and song with emotion and their dancing was outstanding. It showed a weird side of theatrical culture but it's Cats. They always have.
10.0,31 December 2019,"I was dragged into seeing this movie with my wife and daughter and even i appreciated the film.

it's fine if it's not your style, that's ok, it's definitely a unique film, but there's nothing wrong with it. great acting, funny, emotional, built in a world of pure imagination.

again, i don't care for the Cats plays and didn't care to watch this film, but it was a well made film that evolved my opinion.

the only fault i can imagine is in being too artistic for the non-artistic to appreciate"
10.0,12 January 2020,"I love the broadway musical and I loved the movie!! Incredible singing, dancing and music! Only for those enjoy musicals..."
10.0,31 December 2019,It was everything I hoped for. Beautiful singing beautifully done. Don't expect anything more than Broadway in the big screen.
10.0,23 December 2019,"Go see for yourself and ignore the 1/10 reviews, that's abit extreme.. The choreography and the singing are great especially Jennifer Hudson's performance, that was truly amazing! brings tears to one's eyes. It does however seem to take some time with the story telling, as there isn't much dialogue, it's mainly expressed with alot dancing and singing, well that's a musical for you...that's what happens. I'm glad I watched it and I would watch again just to see my favourite parts again."
10.0,23 March 2020,"It's almost disappointing how lazy people have become. A large majority of these 1-star reviews are little more than people trying to come up with the most clever cat pun they can. To see how funny they can be while delivering their negative review, but read them, it's rare to see someone actually commenting on the film, they're all just stupid one-liners.

The point I'm trying to make is that Cats is actually a lot of fun. It's weird and wild and everything that Cats has ALWAYS BEEN. If you don't like Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, you probably won't be interested. If you just don't like musicals, maybe not for you. If you can't check out of the real world and into a fantasy for a couple of hours, don't bother. But if you're willing to suspend belief for a couple of hours, Cats is actually a really good time.

Cats has always been humans dressed as cats, singing and dancing and flipping all over the stage, if that makes you uncomfortable, find something else to watch. But if you want to have a good time with some trippy imagery and great music, you'd be hard-pressed finding something more in line than Cats."
10.0,6 January 2020,"What more can I say? The luscious manes enticed me from the beginning, the CGI reminded me of how good life could be under full-immersion virtual reality.

For the love of God, take me in Cats, I am yours."
9.0,16 January 2020,"I hardly ever write reviews online but feel I have to step in and say to everyone who jumped on the bandwagon to pan this movie: this is a well-rendered screen version of the stage musical Cats. It's a film version of a live song-and-modern-dance revue based on a small book of poems. There is not a strong story in either book or stage show. The stage version ran for so long, and continues to be staged, because it's a dance spectacular with catchy songs. Cats is played by adult humans dressed in leotards, simulating a cat-like demeanour, because that is what this musical is. No doubt this film could have been animated or CGI-ed but that would lose one very important consideration in the whole shebang: Cats is not actually about cats, It's about people."
10.0,11 January 2020,
10.0,9 January 2020,"I love musical theatre, the crazy weirdness of tales that stretch the imagination coupled with fantastic songs, costumes and unworldly characters. I can only imagine that cinemagoers where expecting another ""greatest showman"", or ""la la land"" - basic stories with some great commercial songs. Cats is a proper musical, and for me, this film encapsulated the theatre experience. It's good that there is something on offer for all tastes."
10.0,27 December 2019,"To all the bad critics, it is a magical movie true to the musical. If you haven't seen the musical, go watch it. - The set and everything was beautifully made. Yes the human hands and feet were a bit meh, I'd like to see the CGI improvements. The story was even easier to understand following the character of Victoria through the story. All in all, the movie kept the memory of the musical alive !"
10.0,29 December 2019,
8.0,22 December 2019,"This was a brilliant film. Theatrical, magical awesome set piece after setpiece. No idea what critics are on about. Focus is on minutiae of cgi, who blooming cares, all looked shiny and other worldly to me, had cat ears and looked furry, what more do you need. Hatchet jobs are utterly baffling. Film has nothing profound to say, but is absolutely pure entertainment. All actors performed very well, no continuity between scenes, but that was nature of stage musical. Music was fabulous throughout.Whole thing is an absurd contrivance of overblown silliness, and absolutely wonderful for it."
9.0,27 December 2019,"I absolutely loved this live action version of Cats. Yes it was a little different than the staged production but stayed faithful to it as well. The cast was very good and the choregraphy and singing was really well done. Jennifer Hudson was amazing.

My personal opinion is that if you're a fan of CATS or musicals, go see it and form your own opinion. Don't listen to the reviews. Some people will always find somethimg to complain about."
8.0,29 December 2019,"I thought the movie was fantastic. I feel like whenever there is a film adaptation of a book or a play, any differences made automatically make people hate it. the singing was beautiful, the dancing was beautiful, it was overall an amazing/fun film. it saddens me that it'll be remembered as nothing but a box office bomb."
8.0,23 December 2019,"Anyone who saw the Cats on stage will appreciate the level of effort and attention to detail that went into this production. If the CGI bothers you there is always the 1998 version, which is just the stage production captured on film. If you appreciate world class ballet and moving vocal performances, ignore everyone that seems to take pleasure in deriding this film for taking it to another level."
10.0,29 December 2019,I loved the movie I don't understand why it is getting such bad reviews
9.0,23 December 2019,"I know there have been reviews dragging it but I applaud the movie for helping me to actually enjoy one of my most hated musicals. Are we forgetting that these cats were TERRIFYING on stage? I think they are cute in the movie. I loved the scenery and sets and how it brought believability to the world in the eyes of a cat!

Side note: the trailers before hand seemed oddly youthful to be shown before a movie basically about cats in heat."
9.0,26 December 2019,"At first the human-faced cats were a bit strange, but the beautiful (and sometimes wonderfully weird) music and dance pulled me into the story of the streetcats lives. I laughed at the typical cat behaviour and felt deeply for Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella. Her performance of Memories had me crying my eyes out. Judi Dench was amazing, Ian McKellan was wonderful, Francesca Hayward was super endearing and Laurie Davidson's Mistoffelees was magical.

Of course there were some bits that were mediocre, like Taylor Swift and Idris Elba's roles would've been far better served by better dancers/singers/actors. They were clearly included as 'big names', but they merely fizzled...

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
10.0,2 January 2020,"I went into this with a lot of trepidation. I've never seen the stage show, but I have watched the video of the musical, that was released many years ago. I love musicals and I'm a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but I didn't care for the video at all and have never been a fan of this musical. I've simply never understood the appeal. Plus... I hate cats. I find them repellant in every way.

All of that said, my 16 yr old daughter was intent on seeing it, but even she wasn't expecting a lot. She just loves the song ""Memory."" So, ultimately, me going to see this was to take her and my attitude was one of morbid curiosity. At worst, I was expecting to find it as obnoxious and pointless as actual cats and, at best, I was hoping for *so bad it's good.*

After the first few numbers, to my absolute shock, I found myself smiling and laughing at the silliness of it all. Rebel Wilson's character's feature song has some ridiculous, slapstick visuals. Her presentation of ""dinner & a show"" was precisely my kind of pun.

I'm not going to get into every detail, because I feel like that's the problem. So many people are picking apart a movie that should just be 2 hours of eating some popcorn & candy, tapping your toes, seeing virtually every character devouring every inch of the scenery, and just plain leaning back and having fun with it.

If you hated this, you went into it expecting far too much. I had zero problem with the CGI, which I fully expected to find distracting. I've heard people say that the people faces on the cats is creepy. Ummm... THAT'S the show!

The only understandable and earnest criticism I've heard is from people who love the stage show and found the changes frustrating or even upsetting. I get that. This isn't the same as ""the book was so much better"" (one of the most pretentious phrases in the English language). When you take a show that is one of the longest running, most beloved musicals of all-time and present it as a film, really the only changes should be whatever needs to be done to the sets to modify them for the big screen. Significant plot changes or a central character changing genders is going to doom your movie to fail because you've just alienated your core audience, and therefore the bulk of your revenue.

For myself, however, given that I have no affection for the source material, I was able to watch it from an entirely different perspective. None of the changes bothered me in the least because I barely remembered the original to begin with. My only memory (no pun intended) was that I didn't like it. So, if some of it was overly silly, or a storyline was cut, or a gender changed, it didn't register with me. This freed me up to simply have a fun time with what basically amounted to kitty American Idol.

My only problem with the movie itself was that I felt that the ending was flat and felt unresolved. Without giving too much away, after speaking with a few others in the theater, they agreed that one additional scene (literally it would have taken 10 seconds) would have tied the ending up nicely and not left the audience going ""What happened to (insert character here)? Is that really it?""

Bottom line? If you want to go see this movie, I say go into it understanding that you're not going to watch an Oscar contender. This isn't a masterpiece of cinema, nor is it intended to be. It's a couple of hours of lighthearted entertainment with some really entertaining music, a charismatic cast (many of whom you will recognize, let that be part of the fun), weirdly attractive cats, and nothing at all to take so damned seriously. Stop overanalyzing and stop with the hyper negativity. Walk in, kick back, and just have a good time!"
10.0,24 April 2020,"I enjoyed my viewing of this at the Cinema. The Story is about which one of the cats get to go to the Heaviside Layer. And each of them does a Performance.

Things I liked:

° The Visuals Were Great

° I like the Musical style, It was very Enjoyable.

° The Story was Great

Overall, For me, It was a great and unique production."
8.0,17 October 2020,"I recognize that the movie version is very different from the original Cats stage musical production but the beautiful and magical essence of the story is still there. If you enjoy watching the performance of world class ballet dancers that can also sing, and want to listen to a sublime rendition of the song Memory you will definitely not waste your time or fall asleep."
10.0,28 December 2019,I ignored the overwhelmingly bad reviews and found it weird and very enjoyable.
9.0,28 December 2019,I don't understand all the negative reviews. If you loved the stageshow you understand the movie. It is still actors with a costume and dressed as Cats. Loved this with CGI making the costumes even more beautiful.
10.0,23 December 2019,"I've been in love with the music of cats since I was 12. In my 30s I saw the stage show. It wasnt great but not terrible. Yes it does lack plot, its basically a song and dance extravaganza with people in very tight leotards and cat ears and whiskers. Memory is the highlight. One of my favourite songs ever. So,I wanted to see the movie, but I knew what to expect, I wasnt shocked by the cat costumes or searching for a plot, infact the movie tried to improve the plot somewhat. So I wasnt fond of This version of Macavity. He is not meant to be a pantomime villain but a sleek, cool, mysterious cat. I did like the characterisation of Victoria, Mr Mistoffoles and Grizabella. Jennifer Hudsons Memory was good enough, Taylor swifts Macavity was let down by her weaker voice. Overall I did like it and so did my friend, it was a packed Saturday night screening and no mass walk outs. I understand people not liking it but I dont understand this mauling its getting. Did they know nothing of the stage play before they bought their ticket and what exactly were they expecting?"
10.0,13 July 2020,A Marxist masterpiece with a stellar soundtrack to boot. I don't think we have evolved enough as the human race yet to truly appreciate this masterpiece. One day we will look back on this movie as inspiration for abolition. James Cordon sucks tho
10.0,2 January 2020,"I really think that lots of people made up their mind about this film before they went to see it just based on memes and negativity, like they've seen this through a tainted veil.

The singing and dancing is all great and the cast put in a great performance. I especially love Mr Mistoffellees, Rum Tum Tugger, Monkustrap and Grizabella. The singing and the dancing is the main reason for enjoying a film like this.

There's so much out there saying the CGI is rubbish or creepy that I think it's clouded judgement. OK, not perfect, but really not that bad. I went with my 11 year old daughter and she loved it and loved how the cats look.

The story, or lack thereof, is the same as the very successful stage show so I'm glad they didn't change that and try to invent a story. That's just what the story is.

The only time I thought it looked it odd was when the scale felt occasionally wrong (like when they were walking along rail tracks - they looked more mouse size than cat size.)

Please go see this with an open mind, not a clouded one and just enjoy the show."
10.0,27 December 2019,"I know there was no story. There was never going to be one. The CGI is all over the place. It's the first use of this technology in this way. For some reason it got rushed out and sent in unfinished. I found it frustrating because there are some brilliant dance and vocal performances in here, and I never knew what was real talent and what was cgi and what was real talent being clumsily pasted over with CGI. But it was clear that everyone involved was committed 100 percent.

It's insane that this exists at all. I

magine pitching and funding and shooting and editing this monster of stitched-together set pieces. It's like a Berkeley Busby musical generated by one of those deep mind AIs. We won't see another movie like it at all, probably ever, but we will see the results of the lessons from this movie in many movies to come as CGI comes into its own."
10.0,24 April 2021,"I saw this movie without ever seeing any of the stage play or videos of the stage play. I had not heard any reviews when I first saw it but I knew it was a famous play which was highly regarded. The cast is quite amazing, consisting of some of the greatest singers dancers and actors in the world. The story is decades old and proven throughout the world to be a fan favorite. The songs are famous so we can't say that the material is bad. I loved the execution and the set design and the special effects used to give the characters their costumes was world class.

I've now watched this at least 15 times and enjoyed it every time. As far as all these reviewer's giving it one or two stars I can only guess that they're young not familiar with the material and have a little taste or appreciation for this type of style."
10.0,16 March 2020,"If you are an artist, you have had watched the whole thing, but if you are just a regular old folk with a keyboard you couldn't have even watched 5 minutes of the art. yes, this is an ART. because it is portrayed by artists. it explains many different things in the industry of movies, music.. a cat universe dimension of Hollywood. wonderful."
8.0,2 February 2020,"Tom Hooper did it again...! Everything in the films is just like have always been, the visuals are stunning. Robbie Fairchild, Francesca Hayward and Taylor Swift are phenomenal and Lloyd Webber music just slayed! Definetely a film for ages..."
10.0,29 December 2019,"I don't get it! Why the review ratings for Cats is so poor? Having just seen it, my experience was magical! The acting, the singing, the dance, the costumes... were all amazing. Those with me in the cinema were equally impressed and happy as we left. The latter parts were sufficiently moving to give me goosebumps. So, what's not to like? Nothing. I have seen the live stage performance twice in different theatres. This movie was a different experience, but equally as good. So don't let the reviewer comments and rating put you off. Go and make up your own mind."
9.0,7 February 2020,It was as good as the original film from 1998! I enjoyed it!
8.0,1 January 2020,"If you love theater and are a fan of the musical Cats, this is a must see. This version really does a good job of presenting the story along with great singing."
8.0,24 December 2019,"Honestly, I think everyone is being melodramatic and I just don't think they appreciate musicals or have any idea of how to appreciate something outside of their comfort zone. The music, acting, choreography, and cinematography were absolutely amazing. It seems critics who are leaving the most outlandish, and hateful reviews clearly never saw Cats on Broadway. It follows the play's plot exactly. I think people need to adjust their expectations when seeing this film. I mean it's called Cats! What are people expecting?? Regardless, go in with an open mind and just enjoy the music if nothing else. Have your own opinions."
10.0,23 December 2019,"If you base this review solely on whether or not you liked how the characters looked, then you're completely discrediting the other amazing aspects of this movie. I can see how a person who doesn't know the plot of Cats beforehand might be confused while watching, but if you open your mind then you can see that the plot is SO magical. I loved it and the amazing choreography, songs, and acting."
10.0,25 December 2019,"Although we have been to the theaters to see Cats several times, this movie on big screen has touched our hearts and souls in a overwhelming way.

We really do not understand why there are so many people that rates it so low. Is it because the 'professional criticasters' do that?"
10.0,26 December 2019,"Sad to see how they trash this great film. I want to say that I had a great time watching this movie, it was really fabulous! The music, the singing, the dances, it was just good. Love every minute of it. Cats The movie is magical. I laughed, I cried, and enjoyed the music. Critics for some reason wanted to bring down this film and people follow so much what they said. Please, be your own critic and enjoy it."
10.0,5 January 2020,"Where are the middle people at? I love the original Cats and this one, too. They're different in several ways, including an original song by Taylor Swift, ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If people are against the art changing, I don't think they really understand what Cats represents. It is known for being a megamusical that transformed musicals into blockbusters. So, hating a Cats remake is pretty nonsensical lol. If you are a stage purist, you wouldn't like Cats at all. If you go into this expecting the same passive entertainment as a superhero movie, you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a word for word and step for step original rendition of Cats, you will be disappointed. There was a wonderful blend of playful and artistic, and I personally liked it a lot. Good art requires some participation of imagination by the viewer, but it doesn't mean it has to be too serious. Scrooges."
10.0,22 December 2019,"I thought all in all the movie was cute. Taylor Swift can sing but acting isn't for her. People are complaining that there isn't a story line... again, if you saw the Broadway production of Cats, you would know this was the case with the play. The movie is a story about each ""type"" of cat. The songs were great. A sing-a-Long ability unlike most plays turned into movies. I went in to watch with the least of optimism and came out loving it! A must see!"
10.0,29 December 2019,"Some film adaptations of Broadway musicals embellish upon and expand the play's story: think West Side Story. This film does not do that - after all it's a very simple story about a tribe of cats. Nor is it an animated Disney-like movie. Instead, the film brings the audience into, on and around the stage of the play. The dancing is excellent, the songs entertaining and I thought Francesca Hayward made an outstanding first performance reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn. With the exception of Taylor, who I don't think dug down quite deep enough, the other ""A"" list performers lived up to expectations. The movie isn't perfect but in the final analysis I think it is a gross mismatch in expectations that has lead to so many trash-talk negative reviews.

P.S. My wife, who has seen the play Cats twice, also very much enjoyed the movie."
10.0,27 December 2019,This was a great film. I don't get why nobody likes it?!?!?
10.0,12 January 2020,"Went into this three weeks into the full on assault of the negative hate campaign. Had to see for myself. Result: an enjoyable film with great characters and song. Jennifer Hudson was great. Ta-Ta was a surprise. Dame Judi Dench and Ian McKellan were masterful. Was it purr-fect? No. Took awhile to get into it. But it was NOT as bad as the dog-pile mob would have me believe. Safe to take kids to, and I liked it. Folks there's a lot of darkness and hate in the world today and this film adds no verse to that dark tale. Look at this film as a little ray of light in a dark world and allow yourself to be transported to A Jellicle Night. Here's to seeing you in the Heaviside Layer!"
10.0,28 December 2019,Going into this I had never seen anything Cats related save for parodies and stills. The plot is a deep dive meta sci-fi story of ascension to a higher plane. Movement is a means of communication among the Jellicles and one must be willing to understand past the visceral display. Like most great works in science fiction this will not be appreciated in its time but future generations will use this film to mark a change in our perception of life.
9.0,31 December 2019,"Yes, I really did appreciate the film, it was far more entertaining than the Wizard of Oz and the endless repeats on TV, this was a breath of fresh air. I viewed the film as though it was a stage performance and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it... I loved the songs even if they were shortened, I loved the dancing and everything about it...who cares if the CGI is not perfect, there are faults in every film you watch! Yes, I could watch this again and rate this to be better than la la land.. well done to all concerned."
9.0,15 January 2020,"Boo to the naysayers who obviously do not like cats or musicals. I was afraid I would be a strong critic, comparing it with the original stage production which I fell in love with after seeing it in London many years ago. BUT I was in as much bliss at the movie as I was at the stage musical! So fun!! It was hard to keep from singing!!

I at first found it odd that Old Deuteronomy would be cast as a female this time, but Judy Dench was PERFECT in the roll! My only critique is that I did not like making one of the Jellicle Cats be an evil character....that was a new spin not seen in the stage production. Mischievous cats, yes.....but not evil in the sense that McCavity was portrayed here. Could have done without that sequence.

However, in all, it was top notch. Such work went into this....the movements of the cast to be cat-like, all the dancing. Why this was snubbed for an Oscar nomination is beyond me. Everyone behind this production deserves more than what the critics and many viewers gave them. All of my friends who have seen it seemed to love it as much as me!!

I will say that not only is this likely to be my favorite movie for the rest of 2020 (I saw it in Jan. 2020) but it just may be my favorite movie of all time. Move over, Sound of Music!!"
10.0,12 January 2020,"The movie was exquisite! The costumes and makeup and of course Andrew Lloyd Webber's music! It told the story and had the moves and went far beyond what it could go on stage. My advice is to read TS Eliott's book and see the play before you coment on the movie! However if you have no sense of fantasy this is not a movie for you to see, or book for you to read or a play for you to watch!"
8.0,2 January 2020,Not sure what all the negative press was about. It is what it is...people dressed as cats..! Loved all the actors - especially Mr Mistoffelees!
9.0,21 December 2019,"And by god I loved every minute of it! This film does absolutely everything wrong but the things it gets wrong will elevate this movie to the legendary level of THE ROOM, MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE, and yes THE APPLE.

Seriously I want this insanity to live on! This is the cinematic equivalent to opening the box from Hellraiser... pain and pleasure all at the same time. Tom Hooper has such sights to show you and these visions will burn themselves into your brain and if you approach this film knowing you are gonna see something utterly unhinged, unnerving, and unbelievable.

It just hurts so good!"
9.0,21 December 2019,"Starts with a bang with the Jellicle Cats song and doesn't let up. Highlights were Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Jennifer Hudson and Francesca Hayward. Ignore the critics -- people will enjoy this for years to come."
8.0,6 January 2020,"Masterpieces take time to grow. They often encounter misunderstanding among the public first. This is the case here. What a great story. What awesome special effects. Right in front of the heart. If you look back at the cinema of our time in fifty years, this film will shine out as a shining marvel."
8.0,21 December 2019,"I have never seen the stage show but hoped that this film would reflect it. I wasn't disappointed, this film is a must for those who like West End theatre. A total Marmite film which I believe is the same as the stage show. The acting was spot on, Judi Denchi was cast perfectly as was Ian McKellen and there was no pretence at being politically correct unlike a lot of other movies out at the moment, a classic case of the right person for the job. The only negative I have was Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory which I don't believe did it justice. The film also enhances the appearance of the characters from the stage show with the CGI which is magical."
10.0,21 December 2019,"I loved the movie adaptation of my favorite musical! Its clearly not for all audiances but, if your a fan you will love it too!"
8.0,23 December 2019,This movie at first was kinda lame and boring but then the movie started to grow on me. I believe they deserve 10 stars after all the hard work they put into this movie!
8.0,28 December 2019,"I'm so glad I ignored all the negative reviews. Cats was an mind blowing and amazing experience. I can't describe in words what I witnessed, but all i can tell you is that I left the theater a happy guy.

Was it weird to see CGI Cat/human hybrids act like dancing felines, yes it was. Was it a horrifying experience that will never leave my brain. No it was not. The movie was everything I expected the cats movie to be and more. Could it be better? 100% yes it could be better. But this movie is a perfect example if the negative hype reaches it before the positive does. The new Star Wars movie is a dumpster fire compared to this and I am a huge Star Wars fan.

If you love musicals, If you love weirdness and if you love CATS; go see this movie! You wont regret it."
8.0,5 January 2020,"The critics are wrong, the way I see it. If you guys don't like musicals, then why did you ever bothered to go and see it? This was a famous play 20 years ago, and they sure did it justice. All the colours, the lights, the music, the coreography, everything was just the same, with a perfect cast. I don't know what more could you want"
9.0,27 December 2019,"With all the bad reviews, it seems obvious that those who hate it fail to understand that this film is based on a live theater show. Film critics who have never seen it live look somewhat ignorant. If one liked the play, then they will likely enjoy the film as well. I thought most the casting was excellent. Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella was a touching performance, as was Dame Judi Dench as Deuteronomy . Taylor Swift's contribution was lovely as well. Not that the film was prefect. McCavity and Growltiger didn't work for me. This film merits being compared to the stage musical and not being compared to other film genres ."
9.0,18 October 2020,The musical version of Cats adapted into movie in a honest form. The singing beautiful and acting match. All the negative reviews from ignorant non Broadway fans. This is a great movie for Cats lovers!
8.0,12 October 2020,"The costumes, singing, choreography and sets are outstanding. Performances are very enjoyable. If you're not a fan of theater or dancing you'll probably dislike this but my husband and I absolutely love it. I will watch this again and I don't watch movies twice."
10.0,3 August 2020,"Ok this wasnt for everyone, but i really enjoyed it and even got misty eyed at the end wasnt fair to get such a low rating, obviously some people went into this with different expectations, the dancing was beautiful the singing was lovely i thought the whole thing was great"
10.0,14 October 2020,This film had such a roasting I've only just watched it. I've come away thinking what a gem of a movie. So much work has gone into it and such an all star cast. Francesca Hayward is beautifully as the white cat Victoria. I think you have to go in with an open mind and they become so believable as cats. I hope that this becomes a cult classic like so many that are panned by the critics. The rendition of Midnight had me in floods of tears. Watch it all the way through and judge for yourself.
10.0,21 May 2020,
10.0,20 January 2020,
10.0,14 August 2021,I know it has some bad CGI and I know it's been criticized a lot but I like the movie cats I mean I like the songs I even like Taylor Swift in it too I know it sounds like it's saying or a movie but the one you think about it everybody's got their own opinion on it that's why I give it at 8 star note I wouldn't recommend this for children under age.
10.0,10 September 2020,
10.0,28 March 2020,"Naaah.... just kidding. This movie is crap.

This movie will end acting careers of many people. Lol."
10.0,21 May 2024,"I am not an movie connaisseur at all but all I can say is that this musical It's pretty decent, I don't even understand why people have so much hate on this movie. I will fully watch it, I just seen the trailer and I liked it, it looks like an old romanian movie called Veronica, it reminds me of it, I will recommend that too. People just love to give so much hate for no reason, I am that type of person who I like any movie or song, anything has something special in it, like this musical movie named Cats for example. Also I've seen that has some big big names in musical industry like Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson or Taylor Swift. I could easly watch it, seems so relaxing and beautiful."
8.0,2 April 2020,"What a nightmare. All the one star reviews are true. Unless you are forced to watch this movie, don't. Just don't. After 1 hour, asked my 7 year old what this movie was all about and she had no idea. But she likes cats and kittens in general so of course we watched this incomprehensible compilation of singing and dancing. I really have no idea what this movie is all about. All I do know is that if I ever find myself watching this again, hell is real and I am dead."
9.0,9 January 2020,"I loved every minute of CATS! The music is wonderful, the cast impressive, the acting perfect, and the special effects amazing!!

I loved the theater production. This version made a few changes to the play, but it's still enjoyable. If you loved the play, and/or you love cats, then go see this movie!!"
8.0,9 January 2020,
8.0,4 January 2020,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I absolutely loved the movie. It was beautiful. The music was lovely, the ""cats"" were graceful and expressive, and the scenery was spectacular. I think those who didn't like it/hated it/hoped it would burn in he!! are the ones who also think the play is a joke. To some, I'm sure it could be, but I loved the play and I loved the movie. My two friends who were with me loved it too. I know, birds of a feather and all that..."
9.0,27 December 2019,"I loved the movie! The critics and reviews suggesting it is too sexual... clearly have their mind in the gutter. It is an entertaining adaptation of a Broadway MUSICAL- something that most seem to be forgetting. If you appreciate great dancing, singing, and fun- this movie is for you! If you love to jump on the bandwagon and hate whats popular to hate, might as well just save your money."
9.0,13 January 2020,"I saw this today and although it takes a minute to get used to the CGI and the half human / half cat style they've gone for, the film itself is great. It's fairly true to the musical and the acting was fantastic. Especially Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella. It's fun and entertaining and well worth a watch.

I think people have jumped on the bandwagon unfairly rating this a 1/10. It's nowhere near that bad, even if you didn't like the film. I expect that if you aren't a fan of the musical you might not enjoy it, so maybe see the musical first."
8.0,4 January 2020,Has anybody who's watched the film actually watched the musical? It's a brilliant version of play and a top draw cast (excluding Taylor Swift). All 5 of our family came out loving it and wanting to see it again!!
8.0,24 December 2019,
10.0,22 December 2019,"For a commercial movie, cats is weird and uncomfortable looking but from the performance art point of view, cats is spectacular! All the performers did a touching emotional acting job."
8.0,25 December 2019,Its Cats...If you didn't like the movie you wouldn't like the Broadway show either. I love the music and the poetry of it all. Very good
8.0,21 December 2019,"Cats the musical has always been very special to our family and I was apprehensive going to see the film, but I absolutely loved it.

Almost all of the wonderful songs were there (just one missing), along with a beautiful new song. The dancing was fantastic and the comedic asides had us chuckling away.

Jennifer Hudson really captured the emotion of her character, and has a beautiful voice, Judi Dench was wonderful and the way Victoria was incorporated into the storey was clever and heart warming.

For people not familiar with the musical the story will probably seem a bit thin and the dance breaks may pall if that's not something that people enjoy, but Cats is about the spectacle rather than the plot and I found this film spectacular."
8.0,22 December 2019,"I must say I am unspeakably disappointed with the negative reaction! This film was incredibly powerful drawing I into a completely different universe which is rare considering the film industry moves so fast quality is forgotten for quantity. If you are unable to handle innovation then sure stay at home but it is only yourself you are punishing. Different has always historically had backlash but you would think when today we pride ourselves for having an open mind you could handle some cgi. So, go against the grain and take a chance on arguably one of the best films you shall see because in this next decade I am sure the technology shall be repeated endless times but never feature the whimsicalality captured."
9.0,23 December 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the stage show and was a bit apprehensive about seeing the film remake, but it completely exceeded expectations and was INCREDIBLE! Perfect casting, perfect renditions of the songs, perfect costume/CGI - just WOW! If you haven't seen Cats at the theatre then you're not going to get it as it is an odd concept (still love it) so they're reaching a very niche market hence why the reviews haven't been great, sadly. But I hope the Cats fans out there agree with how amazing this remake is!!"
9.0,24 December 2019,If you like musicals then you will enjoy this movie. It's almost more for kids than adults because it's almost like a cartoon. But it was such a fun movie. If you sit down with the attitude that you're gonna hate it then you'll hate it. But if you expect what Cats always has been then you'll enjoy it. I liked it better than the stage musical for sure.
8.0,20 December 2019,I only watched the movie because I wanted so bad to dislike it but taylor made me fall in love with it :)
8.0,1 January 2020,"CATS IS FANTASTIC!

A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCTION! WONDERFUL PRESENTATION, ACTING AND MUSIC. LOVE LOVE LOVED the entire show.

Costumes were incredible and seamless, very realistic ... how the heck did they control those cat tails? MUSIC was spectacular and exciting. Can't wait to download the sound track. Bravo to the orchestra.

Movie Critics who gave it less than awesome reviews need their heads examined. Maybe non-cat folks wouldn't get it! It's a great story line. Even my 85 year old mother LOVED IT! So, boo boo to the haters."
9.0,30 December 2019,I don't know why this film is getting such bad reviews or why people are so turned off by it. I loved the film. I thought it was a great adaptation of a wonderful musical.
10.0,25 December 2019,Took me on a magical and emotional journey. Jennifer Hudson and the other cast were phenomenal. (Only saw the recast version.)
8.0,8 January 2020,
9.0,22 December 2019,
10.0,26 December 2019,Seen it with my children we all really enjoyed it bit of a slow starter but got loads better song are amazing cast are good will definitely see it again.
8.0,23 December 2019,I can't even fathom.. what the hell. People are thinking when they walk away from this film without calling it what it is. A masterpiece. It's such an astounding work of art.. that I'm stunned.. by the philistinism I'm discovering in these comments.
10.0,23 December 2019,I think people went into the theater with those bad comments and went out thinking the exact same thoughts because they went out of their way to find something bad about a really good movie so just try to enjoy it for yourself and ignore the rude comments. By the way Taylor was my favorite part.
10.0,26 December 2019,Took my mom for Christmas. I do not understand the bad reviews. The set design and music were fantastically done. I saw this on stage as a child and was mesmerized...... this did not disappoint me one bit. The Chorus Line and Choreography were all on point. Anyway I enjoyed myself and so did my mom.
10.0,29 December 2019,"Like many, I was nearly put off going to see this because of the negative response from the media but I'm also known for wanting to form my own opinion. I genuinely thought it was brilliant! I have seen the stage show a couple of times and I think this is perhaps key. The fact that it's humans dressed as Cats is really not the issue the press try to tell you it is. After all, this is how it is on the West End. The cinematography is fantastic and I found the storyline so much easier to follow than on the stage. It's understandable that it won't suit everyone but I can guarantee that if you love musicals, maybe know a couple of the songs, you will not be disappointed. The only odd bit was near the end when Idris Elba (Macavity) took off his coat and I found myself looking for his furry bits 😆 If you thought you might like this but have been put off by the critic reviews, take my advice, ignore them and go and enjoy an evening out."
8.0,5 January 2020,"It's a beautiful direction, singing, dancing.. for its genre it's a nice piece!!! If you are into musicals, you should definitely give it a try!!!!"
8.0,6 January 2020,It's not as bad as the 1 star reviews make out. Those reviewer seem to want a live recording of the original west end production?? As a family we enjoyed it & the kids are still listening to the soundtrack
10.0,21 January 2020,"I wasn't going to go see this movie due to all the bad reviews. But I decided to go, and I'm so glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Sure, there were parts that made me raise an eyebrow, such as the skin removal and the furry creature wearing a furry coat... But all in all, I absolutely loved it! Of course, it's going to be strange, it's about dancing and singing cats, for crying out loud!!! I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews and I think many are just being mean for the sake of being mean or looking clever. Loved the music, the dancing, the setting. If I could change one thing, it would perhaps be the shape of some of their heads/faces, but really, that would be all! Watch it, decide for yourself."
8.0,23 December 2019,
9.0,26 December 2019,"I disliked the musical, which I saw twice. I went to see the movies because the trailer was impressive, despite what critics said. My wife also was reluctant. We were both wowed--the storyline was powerful, the songs and dancing moving, and the sfx impressive."
8.0,23 December 2019,"If you like musical theatre you'll love this. It was brilliantly acted by a wonderful cast.

It contained a wide range of dance routines with some brilliant performances particularly from Idris Elba and Judy Dench.

If you don't like musical theatre you are unlikely to enjoy this."
10.0,16 February 2020,"Cats is an utter delight Apart from the cringe worthy Taylor swift bit.

I'm not a fan of musicals but this is one of the three that I put my hand up to liking CGI is subtle and clever. The plot is fairly easy going but has no need to be anything more Brilliant dance sequences and first rate casting

Bighli GA are Ian McKellen, Judi dench and the surprise appearance of ray winstone as growltiger

The standout moment is the beautiful 'memory' song.

Simply don't get why everyone is panning it. Or were you all expecting something else?"
10.0,21 December 2019,I dont know why its receiving such bad reviews. I thought it was an enchanting memorable movie! Loved Judy Dench and Ian McClellan especially. Memories was a tear jerker song of course and not a dry eye in the theater! Loved it!
10.0,24 December 2019,"Cats Movie Review: I know you all have been waiting lol.... First off if you have not seen the musical , don't know what a jellicle cat is, or what the Heaviside Layer is you will be totally lost lol. Pick up T.S. Eliot Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats , then you will know even Andrew Lloyd Weber turned it into a story just about cats with incredible music and stunning visuals. That's the play. The movie is also magical , but the CGI is creepy, I couldn't get past the human hands and feet on the cats and some of them wore shoes too 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️. I decided to just enjoy the amazing sets, the great music ( love the new song addition of beautiful ghosts) and the all star cast. Overall it was a weird fun movie. I enjoyed it and I loved all the musical numbers, I am a huge fan of the musical and have seen it numerous times, it was fun to see in a different way with a bit of a twist. The message is a positive one, it's never too late for a new beginning. My favorites were Francesca Howard, Jennifer Hudson, and Robbie Fairchild."
10.0,29 December 2019,"Loved this movie! If you love cats you will adore this movie, songs are brilliant and dancing is wonderful! I have seen the theatre production and this is almost as good. Those who say it has no plot have no imagination."
9.0,24 December 2019,"I don't understand all the negative reviews. While Cats was by no means perfect it was by definitely enjoyable.

I assume that the reviews are either from Taylor Swift stans disappointed by her 5 minute cameo or from people that expected this to be similar to a Disney live action remake!

The dancing was beautiful and the singing, especially Jennifer Hudson's version of ""Memories"", was spectacular. I think this movie is not getting the credit it deserves and everyone should go into the movie with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is, a cinematic rethinking of a theatrical classic."
9.0,22 December 2019,I loved this film and I thought the characters were done really well. Loved the songs as well. Highly recommend this film!
9.0,27 December 2019,"I just got home from seeing Cats and I couldn't wait to write my thoughts here on IMDb.

I taught music in a middle school for ten years. One of the most aggravating subjects to teach was music appreciation. It didn't matter what I exposed the children to they wouldn't even give the subject music a chance.

This is where my review comes in. It isn't necessarily about Cats but about all of the ""1"" ratings it has received here on IMDb. I read about 30 of these bad reviews and it was like listening to a class of 6th graders trying to explain to me why they didn't like Fiddler On The Roof after the first 30 minutes. These reviews, in my honest opinion, were written by someone paid to write bad reviews, a middle schooler or someone with the mentality of one, or someone whose spirit isn't moved in the slightest by music, dance, art, or theater.

I could go on but it would be pointless. Go see this film! It is a masterpiece of movie musicals! The song Memory was knocked out of the park by Jennifer Hudson. You might not give it a ""10"" (I did) but you will see that it deserves far better than the 2.6/10 rating it is currently receiving here."
8.0,29 December 2019,"No idea what the critics are on about. Just been to see this and it is A-MAZ-ING! The production, sets, dancing and singing are world class. It's a superb adaptation that will bring a classic alive for a whole new generation. I'm in my 40s and left wanting to take up ballet classes! The talent on display is astounding. Took my partner and he loved it too. Go and enjoy it. I suspect this is one that will become a cult hit later...(didn't everyone hate The Greatest Showman when it came out?)"
9.0,21 December 2019,The best film I've ever seen If you're a fan of musicals I really recommend this film along with Les Miserables.
10.0,23 December 2019,"If you love Cats on Broadway, I think you'll really enjoy this. Cats will always be something that wont appeal to everybody, but to those that it does, it will be something both fun and special. My favorite was watching Victoria. All of the dancers were incredible."
10.0,28 December 2019,
10.0,16 January 2020,"Yesterday went to see CATS - the movie that seems to be disparaged by Hollywood elitists and many in the general public.

So upfront let me say that I have loved the book ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats' by T. S. Eliot and was thrilled when I saw the stage production with the brilliant score by Andrew Lloyd Webber. Those 2 sources are the basis for my evaluation of this work - ART. It is (opinion of one) ART in its truest form.

I've seen many stage productions -Broadway's Winter Garden, Hollywood's Kodak Theatre and several other productions including London Theatre -West End in London.

At each production I've overheard audience members comments as they leave. Those who understand the ART of the work loved the show. Many others who weren't familiar with the sources either were puzzled or hated it. So I wasn't surprised as I read some the the early reviews.

For the most part the movie did NOT disappoint. The score remains brilliant and many of the performers brought inspired interpretations of their characters.

The most disappointing performance was by Rebel Wilson who portrayed the normal Matronly character of Jennyanydots as a sloven seductress who munches on the tattoo of dancing beetles.

Also disappointed that the characters Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer chose to re-interpret the original music for their characters - poorly done.

Outstanding performances were Jennifer Hudson - Grizabella, Judy Dench - Old Deuteronomy, Taylor Swift -Bombalurina, Francesca Hayward -Victoria and Steven McRae -Skimbleshanks. Both Francesca & Steven were brilliant in their respective dance interpretations.

Bottomline - if you don't know the T.S. Eliot book or the Weber score, you'll enjoy the show better if you read the book and listen to the score. If you hated the stage production, you probably despise the movie. BUT - - - If you love the show, the book and the score - I believe you'll enjoy the majority of this wonderful cinematic version."
8.0,23 December 2019,"A darkness-before-the-dawn experience of melancholy and hopeful, tentative joy. In my view the true leads (despite the trailers and advertising suggesting otherwise) are Francesca Hayward and Robbie Fairchild, who I'd never heard of before now, and they both bring noticeably skilled and assured acting and dancing abilities to their central roles. I loved it, and hope it finds its audience. Saw it on a huge screen with an excellent sound system, and that's the way to experience it."
10.0,5 January 2020,"Yes I did see it and I liked it. And I am even not that a fan of musicals. But this is a musical, singing and dancing. The rest is extra. I found it beautifully sung and danced. And yes the setting was theatre, it is not a film. So why putting this musical down? What were the expectations? I never saw the theatre musical Cats but again this version I really liked. :)

8.0,29 December 2019,"As a fan of the original Broadway Cats, I was not surprised by the ""lack of plot"" and the sight of humans impersonating (incatonating?) felines. I think many of the movie audience were surprised by those things. Cats is a spectacle, not a ""movie"" in the traditional sense.

The dancing and cinematography are very good, it's a visual treat, and there are lots of clever touches in the movement and gestures. While most of the dancing is similar to what could be seen on Broadway, there are interesting changes of scene that provide variety beyond what you'd see on stage.

The strongest portions are the big production numbers such as Jellicle Cats, Skimbleshanks, Macavity, and Mr. Mistoffeles, because the ensemble (real singers and dancers) can shine, even if most of them are unknown and you don't even know their characters' names.

One flaw is that there's too much ""talking"" rather than ""singing"" in some songs. Tom Hooper directed similarly in Les Miz, where the beauty of the singing was largely sacrificed for overly dramatic/emotive (and ultimately unsuccessful) declamation. Why direct musicals if you don't like singing? Because of that propensity, the singing is a mixed bag. There are strong ensemble performances. The weaknesses are in some of the ""big names"" that, Hollywood insistscasting on in musicals, instead of hundreds of better qualified actors. Of the celebrities, Taylor Swift is excellent although she has only one song and little screen time. Francesca Hayward (ballerina) is an excellent dancer, decent singer, and charming as ""Victoria"" the main cat in this revised story. Jennifer Hudson can obviously sing but her ""Memory"" is chopped into fragments and overacted/undersung, rather than just letting her voice and the music do the emoting for her, which I would have preferred. Derulo, Elba, Corden, Wilson, and McKellen are all competent. Judi Dench, however, is terribly miscast as Deutoronomy, as she can barely sing, and the big ""Ad-dressing of Cats"" song which should be climactic is almost ruined byu her non-singing, though redeemed somewhat when the ensemble takes over.

So I enjoyed it, as did my other family members, one of whom is a Broadway ""Cats"" fan and the other was her daughter who knew almost nothing about Cats. It could have been better, but it is not the disaster that many reviews are saying. Musicals just aren't for everyone, particularly this very unusual musical."
8.0,11 January 2020,"Having watched - and enjoyed - this film I am feeling a bit sorry for all those people who have panned it. So what if the mixed things up a bit from the original stage play. Since when has that been a cinematic crime? And if you go to a musical and complain about the CGI - well, you're paying way too much attention to the wrong stuff!

I thought the casting was great, the music and dancing was engaging, and the film had fun and heart."
8.0,22 December 2019,Loved it ! Especially if you get the musical which has a thin story line anyway. They simply add Victoria as the host where all cats introduce themselves to her instead of addressing the audience/viewer and macavity has a purpose of making each individual cat who is in the running for being re born disappear so that he could be chosen! This is something the stage version lacked. Jennifer Hudson made me cry. Only think I would say is a little more dancing at points :)
8.0,22 December 2019,"I've read so many of the other reviews and I think people had no idea what they were seeing. The film really is just as bizarre as the stage musical so don't expect it to be a 'normal' movie. The cast is great and truly the dancing is magnificent!!!!! Yes the effects are not quiet what I was expecting and there are some definite spatial issues. But if you focus in on the story and the movement of the cast, it's easy to get lost in the Jellicle world. A hint though - if you did not get the stage production then this is not for you."
8.0,26 December 2019,"It is a true singing storytelling concept. Yes: totally different from what I am used to, but great acting and the voices: they really got to me."
8.0,12 July 2021,I grew up watching Cats and loved it in theatre. This was such a brilliant modern translation. I think a lot of people watched it having no idea what Cats is. It gave me goosebumps to see. I loved how they kept so many of the original elements and kept all the songs!
8.0,26 June 2023,"My mom and I got to see this in theaters when it was released. Cats is one of her favorite Broadway shows, so naturally we had to go see this for ourselves. The music and choreography are STUNNING, and I literally got chills during some of the songs. People who think that the cats are creepy but actual horror movies aren't just are after something to hate. This musical theater fan loved this film! My mom said that the film actually added more of a storyline than the original Broadway show had, which she thought was cool and interesting. Haha I guess I could see someone with NO musical theatre knowledge going into this and being confused, but having the background knowledge, this movie was a wonderful experience!"
8.0,1 January 2020,"Cats is not for the basic minded individuals. Sure, it might have the jazziest plots or the most creative settings and camera angels, BUT if you're someone who understands and appreciates musical theatre, then this movie will be enjoyable for you. I feel so many people got caught up in the reviews before having the opportunity to make up their own opinion about it. Mob mentality at its finest."
9.0,22 December 2019,"I'm glad I read the reviews after seeing the film. Having seen the stage show a few years back I was looking forward to the film and I wasn't disappointed.

On a lazy Sunday my son and I took to the cinema away from the madness of the Christmas shoppers and relaxed with our popcorn and we're easily entertained.

The dancing was beautiful as was the singing, there was some comedy elements too.

Yes it's not an epic blockbuster, buts it's the type of film you can enjoy with family or friends. I don't think it deserves all the negative criticism it's getting."
8.0,31 December 2019,"The performances in the film are great and faithful to the characters portrayed. Excellent adaptation of the musical with a few changes that really help for a film portrayal, chiefly the introduction of Victoria as a main character. Francesca Hayward is great as is Taylor Swift's original song.

It appears to me that the negative reviews can all be summed up into four categories:

People who don't like the animation; alright, but it doesn't really detract from the singing and dancing
People unfamiliar with the musical and who were expecting something very different; be familiar with the material"
10.0,30 December 2019,"I was hesitant about seeing this after the reviews but I loved it. After seeing the stage show twice and quite frankly, not having a clue what was going on, the film actually gave it all context and pulled it together. The snippets of dialogue, the scenery and the additional song of 'Beautiful ghosts' really helped.

I think every character in it was perfection and I don't believe that they used Taylor just to ""sell it"" because that character isn't in it for long anyway.

Rebel Wilson was the biggest let down for me. She needs to play better parts. She's the same all the time and I'm bored of her now.

Francesca as Victoria was brilliant. Jeniffer Hudson was sensational and the second part of 'Memory' was perfection. Dame Judy and Sir Ian were absolutely marvellous.

Bravo to all! I urge people to give it a chance. I believe those slating it haven't seen the stage show, so have nothing to base it on."
10.0,31 December 2019,"Just got back from seeing Cats and both my wife and I really enjoyed it. I have never seen the show but am very familiar with the original London theatre score as I heard it dozens of times after my parents went to the show in the early 80s and raved about it. I don't understand the issues people have with the CGI cats as I just saw them as people in costume no different than on stage. The dancing was great and to us was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I now feel I've seen the show but with better staging and effects. If I hadn't read the reviews and was asked by someone should they see it I would have said"" do you like the music of cats and have you seen the show, because if you do and have then you must see it it's great and you will love it"". Make your own mind up,we went totally open minded and loved it."
8.0,22 December 2019,I loved it! It was the same as the musical only better.
10.0,5 January 2020,"This movie its not for the regular population. Its for the artistic, creative and abstract thinkers. Who dont need an explanation for a simple nursery like story about Cats. The cast, dance, music was great. Visual effects better than any real life play. I mean these are Cats played by people. WTH you expected? I been waiting to see the musical for years and Im happy it was done on a big screen. Not all movies need to be about sex violence and drugs or a sad story with a deep meaning. Is the life of a damn Cat period."
9.0,17 March 2020,Can't wait to watch again. Amazingly beautiful! If everyone could just go into this with an open mind I think they'd be more than pleased.
10.0,5 January 2020,
10.0,19 June 2020,"This is still a great symbolic, allegorical piece about the nature of man and the power of love and strong social fabric. I enjoyed the simple beauty of this legendary musical remake. The CGI worked for me. My 5 yr old daughter and I cried at Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory (although perhaps Elaine Paige will always be the one to sing it best). As Victoria, debut actress Francesca Hayward, who took a sabbatical from London's Royal Ballet to film ""Cats."", was a beautiful sight and danced well, but her singing talent was not quite as beautiful (but still enjoyable). Laurie Davidson, dazzles as the magical Mr. Mistoffelees, who doubts his abilities as a magician before realizing his self worth through the belief in him from his fellow Jellicles. Judi Dench covered her role well, bless her soul! An enjoyable fim all in all, but not quite a 10/10."
10.0,12 January 2020,"I for one think that the movie is a masterpiece, it's unique and entertaining. The artists did a really great job portraying as CATS and almost everything on the set is based CATS perspective...well this movie is about CATS after all. Don't listen to critics to blow up your plans about watching the movie. Critics will always be critics and will keep on seeing the bad thing in anything. So just give it a chance you guys. You'll love it."
10.0,24 December 2019,
9.0,15 January 2020,"I don't understand why many people hate this movie?! It's very funny and entertaining. Is it because CGI, which makes things look a little bit weird, is used instead of costumes?! If that is the case then I've to say that I doubt that making actors wear cat costumes in this movie would make things look better. After all, 90's are over and this isn't a live performance.

I give this movie 10 stars because it's more funny and entertaining than I was expecting."
10.0,24 December 2019,"The problem is this is a film gof the educated and ciltured , neither of ehich write reviews on this site"
8.0,21 April 2020,"This was absolutely fantastic and doesn't deserve the hate. It has a confusing storyline, Shure, but the music, dancing, acting, and set are all outstanding. It doesn't really matter what the story is if the music and acting is that good. Please watch this!"
10.0,28 December 2019,
10.0,10 January 2020,"Most reviews I have read by movie reviewers tore this film to shreds. Choreographers tended to like it. Reviewers who said it had no story or plot, wrong. As for the animation, I could have done with fewer floating rose bouquets, but the twitching ears and animated tails were fine with me. As a musical, it had a good balance of song and dance routines. It was thoroughly entertaining."
10.0,13 August 2024,"So if you've never seen the Broadway play I can see how you rate this a 2, and think it is the weirdest movie you've ever seen, because it is. BUT, if you've seen the play the movie is true to it (besides a few small things that I felt actually added to it and clarified the story). While at first the costuming felt a little weird, after 15 minutes you adjust and enjoy. The characters were represented well and in such fun ways in this movie. My daughter was obsessed with Cats (the play) as a tiny child, and watching the movie just brought back all the feels for us. Jennifer Hudson was incredible."
10.0,12 January 2020,"I had to see why nearly every review of this film adaptation spewed repetitious hatred/horror, humorously or seriously, so I saw the movie with a friend. The term CGI is now a ""thing"" apparently, used by every tech-wise reviewer to show how tech-wise they are. They had a field day dissing its use in this film. The plot was a contest (""Who gets to be chosen for a new life?) and nothing more.

Well, I'm glad to say my friend and I actually got a kick out of the movie and enjoyed it for its originality of presentation, the seamless insertions of song-appropriate scenery, and the typical cat behaviors performed by both young and old felines. It was naive, ingenuous and attempted to be no more than that.

As for Jennifer Hudson, I felt her character interpreted the despair of ""Memory"" beautifully--the short screeching part not so much--and thus did not need to imitate Barbra Streisand's uplifting, hopeful ending.

Read my review title again and consider this movie in that context.

(Also please consider using spell-check, or just rereading your review for more than its ingenious brilliance--before submitting it.)"
9.0,16 January 2022,"I loved this movie very much.

Magical, warm, innocent entertainment.

Dame Judi as Deuteronomy ..oh my..I could almost feel her floofie furr and would love to ask her all the great questions on this Earth. Deuteronomy would have all the answers.

It was refreshingly different, but still Cats.

I fell in love with this purrfect tale of hope, friendship and fun.

From now on I will remember how to adress my cats again..."
10.0,7 February 2024,"I remember when CATS first came to DVD. I was a Suncoast Manager and was absolutely ecstatic. We played it in the store constantly. I fell in love with the music and Andrew Lloyd Webers work. I don't know if people have lost the ability to see beautiful things? I absolutely loved this movie. BUT I am a theater / movie buff. Not only did I loved hearing the familiar music but loved finally seeing the story lines played out on a big screen. I especially loved was the cast: Judi Dench and Ian McKellen, James Carbon, and oh my goodness, Jennifer Hudson!! What an amazing Grizabella. The special effects were very well done. Everyone who worked on this production did such a fantastic job. I'll definitely be watching it again for years to come. Maybe it doesn't meet your expectations but if you watch it with an open heart and mind I think you'll see something you might enjoy."
8.0,29 December 2019,"I can't understand why this has had bad reviews, it's thoroughly entertaining and a unique story and spectacle."
8.0,2 January 2020,"The incredible play of the actors really liked (especially Taylor Swift), magnificent scenery and costumes, would go again."
9.0,28 December 2019,Brilliantly done - congratulations to all involved. Will see it again and again - love it.
9.0,1 January 2020,"I saw Cats on New Years Day! I thought it was absolutely fabulous!!

The music and dance was mesmerizing and flawless! I found it extremely interesting and the cast was spectacular! I enjoyed it so much that I could sit through it again and again!! Highly recommend.

I will add that I'm 61 and 6 of us went together (all in the 50-70 year old range)! We all enjoyed it very much!

Maybe age is a factor or appreciation of wonderful and flawlessly delivered music and dance is a factor? I'm not sure, but we almost changed our selection based on the early reviews! Boy are we glad we didn't change!

All of the cast was fabulous, but extra kudos to Francesca Hayward! She was truly remarkable!!

Thanks to all who helped create this masterpiece!"
10.0,18 January 2020,"Film has trained us to beg for high action, cheap thrills and as much skin as possible. This film chose not to fall into the Hollywood model, thank goodness, and play honestly to the original materials it borrowed from. The result was a highly theatrical piece with incredible voices and dance numbers that just brushed the popularity of its Broadway version. Rich with visual skills that only a film could add, the artistic payoff was well-made. I am glad there are still film-makers who don't feel the Hollywood formula is the only type of entertainment the paying audience wishes to see. I am sorry the vast majority just do get this film, but with what they've been feeding on for most of their lives, it's really not a surprise."
9.0,27 December 2019,"We saw Cats at in DC and really liked the play. Yes, I said like. From the photography and effects, the movie was great! The lovely Francesca Hayward was phenomenal as Victoria. My only weak spot was the arrangement (or perhaps the mix) for Rum Tum Tugger. Jason Derulo is a super talent. But the version by Tim Curry was much better."
8.0,21 December 2019,"Don't believe all the negative reviews, this was an excellent film. The only disappointment was Jennifer Hudson as Grizabella, the rest of the cast were brilliant."
8.0,23 December 2019,Sorry Critics. Bravo! Those of us who love the stage musical also loved the movie. I guess you never saw the stage production. So therefore you should refrain from your negative comments.
10.0,18 February 2020,"Seriously what is everyones problem with this? It was entertaining enough, and to be honest the music was spot on, singing well they are actors not singers but did a good enough job.

Anyone who hasn't had the chance to see this on the stage, this is the version for you to see. The sets are fantastic, and the makeup isn't as bad as you may think.

At one point my partner did say - Is this a load of old Thesp's that didn't get to do cats before? However, she does like love island, and didn't understand it.

It's a shame that people are giving this movie bad reviews, when they know no better. This will be a cult classic. Watch the movie, enjoy the music and fantasy visuals, and be reminded of the 80's.

A great bit of cinema, and the cast and crew should be proud of what they achieved."
8.0,2 January 2020,"I didn't love Cats the Musical when I saw it many years ago, but I loved the ballet and dance. Les Miserables had the epic story and Tom Hooper previously directed the Oscar winning film. While Cats had no story, I sat on the revolving stage, best seats in the house, and the show itself was full of musical earworms that are just as catchy 30 years later. Still no one could fail to miss the critical mauling Tom's Cats movie has been given, and my only disappointment was that I didn't get to see the original cut and CGI. I waited until a family trip during Christmas to see it instead.

Royal Ballet Principal Francesca Hayward is the white kitten Victoria, an unwanted Christmas present who gets tossed into the back streets of London's Trafalgar Square. T S Eliot wrote his Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats during the 1930s, and Eve Stewart takes advantage of the period in her beautiful production design, loved the Milk Bar, with fantastical cinematography by Christopher Ross.

We follow Victoria as she meets the lovely Robbie Fairchild's Munkustrap, and the Jellicle cats who will compete at the Jellicle ball, to win the chance to be reborn in the Heaviside Layer. So maybe that 9 lives isn't true after all.

Each cat competing will sing for Judi Dench's, now female, Old Deuteronomy. And that's the story, just following the poems. Some more enjoyable than others. Rebel Wilson as muiscal mad Jennyanydots performing with cockroaches and mice was a little coarse, although the mice were cute.

James Corden's Bustopher Jones plays to his comic strengths as he dive bombs the dustbins of the better class of restaurants in London. But Idris Elba's green eyed Macavity is the cat determined to be reborn, with no obvious talents other than he magics the other competitors away. Two down. A stand out was the Royal Ballet Principal Steven McRae's tap dancing railway cat Skimbleshanks. The Railway Cat's taps matching the chatter of the railway. But he too is stolen away.

Among the other cats I couldn't help comparing Laurie Davidson to Kate Moss's former boyfriend Pete Doherty. But Laurie's Mr. Mistoffelees is a sweet, friendly little cat who looks out for Victoria after she gets herself into mischief with Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer. Danny Collins and Naoimh Morgan leave Victoria tied up in pearls when they are disturbed.

With the cast of A list and new young would-be stars, the scenes are full of psychedelic colour, action and friendship, and into this comes Grizabella, the Glamour cat. An old squeeze of Macavity, she was beautiful then. Now Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella is like Phoebe's Smelly Cat. Unloved and unwanted. Victoria shows herself to have the making of a Jellicle cat when she attempts to befriend Grizabella, while the other cats hiss. For me Jennifer killed the standout song Memory, and not in a good way. The actual standout song instead was the new Beautiful Ghosts, which having heard Taylor Swift sing on the radio, perfectly fitted. But Francesca Hayward as Victoria actually sings it in the film. A surprisingly good voice from the talented young dancer.

Taylor Swift herself is Macavity's new squeeze Bombalurina, but she better watch out she doesn't suffer Grizabella's fate, as she drops catnip onto the Jellicle cats. The feline minx. Game for a laugh Ian McKellen's Gus the Theatre Cat must surely have a particularly good chance of success at the Jellicle Ball. He deserves a second life. But that dastardly Macavity is still cat nabbing contestants. And they all end up magically aboard the jolly roger barge of Ray Winstone's Captain Growltiger. Very weird. If only there was another cat who could magically bring them, and the chief judge back.

Cats is a song and dance celebration with choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler and little spoken words, except by the cats who aren't expected to be able to hold a tune. The dance has been updated with hip hop/street dancing by Jason Derulo's Rum Tum Tugger and Les Twins. But still the ballet and musical theatre dance are the highlights.

The digital fur technology which freaked everyone out is yes a little weird, although I did want to stroke the cats. And I'm more a black Labrador dog sort of person. But then the original show had just skintight costumes, so this is just advancing technology. CGI has been a lot weirder at the movies than a couple of cats. I'm interested in the make-up challenge though as to how the faces were superimposed, if they indeed were. Very impressive however by the make-up team.

Yes I loved it, much more than the stage show. And much more than most of the critics. But then I loved the stage show of Les Miserables more than Tom's film. And after each cat had taken his or her bow I wanted to applaud and sing along with the joyous songs. The cast gave it their all and I feel that James Corden was being dismissive when he said he hadn't watched it yet, but heard it wasn't very good. No doubt if it was a hit he would have been praising it to the Heaviside Layer and back. Well I cannot wait to watch and sing along at home.

Regards Andrew Lloyd Webber, I loved both the stage show of Evita and the film. Madonna was exceptional and Oscar worthy. Now imagine that Starlight Express is set for Hollywood. A distant hope I fear now though. But no one sets out to make a bad film and this certainly isn't one."
10.0,19 January 2020,"It was so good! It's one of the best movies I've ever seen, from the way the actors move like cats to the plot line and everything! I'm obsessed with all of the songs now and would 100% see it again. Amazing."
10.0,28 December 2019,I'm guessing most of these reviewers haven't even watched the film. I saw it with 4 other people. All of whose loved it.
10.0,14 January 2020,"Firstly, to the random reviewer using several accounts to post several reviews each with one star, with an uncanningly similar tone for each - I see you. And if something like this causes you to lose the will to live when so many awful things going on in the world you need a reality check!

Now that I got that out my system on to the movie - is it as bad as the critics said it was? No, of course not, you can't combine the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber with a cast like that and have a complete disaster. The music for those of us who grew up loving ALW's music and learning from him will appreciate the dancing, the beautiful singing, and the mastery that went in to creating something like this. It would have taken a lot of time and energy to create the sequences that, not to mention the visual artists themselves. Sure the vis-effects needed the touch up they were given, and there were still moments that might have needed fixing, but I was too captivated by the talent of the actors and the music for any of it to really bother me. The obvious shape of the cats changing, for example could have had some continuity, but as I said it didn't detract. I think also, that in a film industry that is now very dark, and genre driven a movie with innocence like this as well as the language might be lost.

What Hooper's writers did well was the threaded together the story-line from the stage show to make it more cohesive, and while this was hard to follow for some, if you were paying attention to the lyrics, but I think if you don't know the stage musical or go in for an open mind then you aren't going to understand what's going on. It might have been a case of the writers simplying it without dumbing down the work of T.S. Elliot, but this was already done by ALW & co for the stage musical so what threading it together the way Hooper's team have was great - the use of Victoria the cat played by Francesca Hayward as we learn about the Jellicles through her eyes was great. The new song introduced fitted in seamlessly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride. With Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy you can't go wrong even tho this breaks tradition. I loved Laurie Davidson's interpretation of Mr Mistoffelees as well - he's said to be shy in the poem and Davidson's cat was very endearing.

I'd see it again on the big screen - and I fully encourage you to watch this if you are a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals go and see it for yourself and don't let it's awful reviews put you off. This is a masterpiece in it's own way despite it's flaws. Go with an open mind."
8.0,11 January 2020,
10.0,22 February 2020,"A sign of the times seeing how many people gave this a poor review. They clearly were expecting something that would appeal to their limited attention span. Sadly for them, this requires input from one's brain AND one's creative side. It certainly is NOT a shoot-me-up, not a thriller, nor a horror movie. Rather, this is a movie that invites you to engage with another world, one that has been beautifully crafted. It is obvious from the reviews that people are uncomfortable with costumes that do not look like the costumes they are so used to in the above-mentioned movies. But this is something that's coming from inside of them, and has nothing to do with the very well crafted cat ""suits"". Rather than give a bad review, it would be advisable to perhaps look at the reason why these suits grate on so many people. No, this is certainly not a movie that gives you a shot of adrenaline for 5 seconds and then leaves you wanting another shot. This is 1 hour and 40 minutes of pure enjoyment engaging with a world that could be just as easily a parallel world to ours rather than a fantasy. It certainly is a shame that ""fantasy"" has become a dirty word in this messed up world of ours!"
8.0,23 December 2019,"We recently watched Cats The Movie with a degree of trepidation. After some extremely mixed reviews it was difficult to be confident that we could enjoy it, but we were pleasantly surprised. Some of the comments, such as the characters being highly sexualised, were difficult to relate to. The only issue we noticed were with the CGI whiskers but perhaps unsurprisingly, that wasn't top of our viewing priorities. Ultimately, however, if you are a fan of the stage show then this is well worth a view. If the stage show wasn't your bag, you would be well advised to give it a skip."
10.0,22 January 2023,"As a vocal performer and as someone who's seen every version of this musical, I found this version to have brung magic to the screen, cleverly blurring the line between reality and CGI. This blurring facilitated willing suspension of disbelief coupled with fascination at the magic.

The eclectic and hyper-talented cast bring their unique individual talents and artistry, blending them into an ensemble cast of individual cat personalities, creating a more coherent story than the stage or previous screen versions did.

Cinema purists likely dismiss it as ""much ado about nothing."" But I believe those of us who have performed on stage recognize the skill it requires of the performer to do their turn on the stage in such a way as to invite the audience on stage with them and engage in a joint experience.

Finally, I have a hunch that T. S. Eliot would have viewed this linking together of his Practical Cat poems into a single story line with favor, his characters brought to life and to sound w/Webber's phenomenal musical skills.

The cast members were matched together with their characters extremely well and their vocals were eye- and ear-popping -- both of Jennifer Hudson heart-tearing renditions of ""Memories"" will stick with me because of the power and emotion of her performances.

Ian McKellen's Gus was totally believable (and I don't know how he did it); Idris Elba's Macavity was appropriately sinister, though lacked more definitive exposure ... too bad for us; Judi Dench totally embodied ""Old Deuteronomy"" with immense dignity and depth; for fellow performers, I'd recommend watching them for those tiny, nuanced additions that fully fill out their respective characterizations and performances. Of the group, I believe McKellen's is the fullest despite being one of the briefest -- a master of his craft.

Choreo was imaginative, athletic and extraordinarily well executed. Sight gags were fun and not overdone.

On a slightly downside, Swift's personalized added-song did not display her talent very well (an emotional song, true, but not all that and a dish of cream); though her acting wasn't as free-flowing as the other characters, she brought to hers a bit of innocence and guilelessness.

One element I did miss but that was only referenced was the story of Growltiger, the Terror of the Thames. While I understand its disinclusion due to time constraints, I did miss it ... the references to it in the story let ""familiars"" like me know it wasn't ignored, just not included in full.

If I were a first-time viewer I suspect I'd have a bit of a challenge following the flow of the stories-within-the-story. However, ""Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats"" was not written as a coherent story, but a collection of poems.

In conclusion, I would whole-heartedly recommend this version who was familiar with the previous versions and with Eliot's poems -- but I'd want to do some pre-viewing prep of friends without that familiarity so they'd be ready to appreciate the story and allow them to focus in on the characters and their performances without being distracted by trying to follow plot devices."
8.0,8 January 2020,"I believe if T.S. Eliot were alive he would have liked this movie. It DOES have a plot, just like the poetry book was a collection that had common threads throughout. It is a shame how this gem could be panned so easily. Maybe it is before its time."
8.0,20 December 2019,"If you wouldn't see this on the stage and you don't do musicals, then you won't like the film. This is a full on musical, with endless songs. It's the stage show bought to life.

I personally didn't like the stage show but really enjoyed the film.. You can connect to the characters more and understand the story better because it's a film set, not a static stage.

Moral of the story: If you don't like musicals, don't watch Cats. It's a musical and needs to be judged as one. It's like going to the theatre at the cinema.

They've done a great job bringing the musical to life and Francesca Hayward is just fantastic!"
10.0,5 January 2020,"Very good musical, I like the songs. I cried on one of the scenes. Story was also good, all cats characters were interesting."
9.0,30 December 2019,"Cats really is a spectacle. Sets and costumes are surreal but the characters (with the exception of James Corden) really shine through. There was no need for the new song, which does stick out a bit from the others and the addition of a storyline beyond the basic premise of the Cats vying for a place in the Heaveyside Layer Is superfluous. I enjoyed it thoroughly, it's great to see a movie which presents such an on-screen spectacle."
10.0,22 December 2019,"The common misconception is that diffrent is strange and thus weird and 'bad'. On the contrary this film was a completely unique experience for me, so much so I was giving the 'what are we watching' glance to my partner 20 minutes in.

However I found the charm of the characters, story and music to be drawing me in to a emotional, artistic and vibrant story!

In the end the film finished and I didnt want it to end as I was so indulged in the characters and set.

A excellent experience and would reccomend this film!"
9.0,7 February 2020,"I'll start by saying that I generally love Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and stage musicals. Oddly, though, live productions of CATS never appealed to me that much. But this cinematic interpretation hit the exact right note for me.

If you're going in expected a heavy plot, you'll be disappointed. The tale is simple... about as simple as it gets... a group of felines singing of their personalities and lives.

Of course, there is a meta allegory... about how people (particularly theatre performers) are of a specific ilk... which tends to range from playful to naughty to capricious to otherworldly... just like that of felines.

So, if you appreciate poetry and ballet... and you have a particular fondness for kitties (from the house tabby to a lion)... you might just love Tom Hooper's version of CATS... which, for me, elevated the stage material to something that can only be done in movies... as well as in ones own heart."
8.0,14 February 2020,"""As cast members of the motion picture Cats, nobody more than us understands the importance of ... "" spoke James Corden, then joined by Rebel Wilson to intone in unison ""GOOD VISUAL EFFECTS!"" In the Oscars show, right before they presented the award for Best Visual Effects. While made up in character as Bustopher Jones and Jennyanydots, and indeed seeming an example of two other Oscar categories, (Not-So-Good) Makeup and Costumes.

An article in Esquire states that Cats' box-office failure is being blamed on its visual effects, and that the Visual Effects Society is not happy about it. One VFX artist tweeted ""I assume these two were really classy and thanked me for working 80 hour weeks right up until I was laid off and the studio closed, right?"" (Haven't we been there ourselves? We, the moviegoers who work for our living, and come to the theaters with any spare dollars we'd have if we're lucky?)

Corden and Wilson did not make a serious statement, they were just being funny. Poking a little fun at someone else's expense, maybe. However, the wrong thing to do is to put the blame on the VFX artists. That wrong thing has been done by many critics and many moviegoers. Many, but not all.

Seriously, Cats does have visual effects that are actually good. Every bit as good as those of 1917, Endgame, Skywalker, The Irishman and The Lion King. Cats' underperformance is not due to its VFX. The best visual effects in the world will not compensate for a story told badly. Just how badly told is Cats' story, in comparison to Endgame and Skywalker, is still in debate among moviegoers.

Cats is not really as bad, or as weird, uncomfortable or ""traumatic"" as people call it. Cats' biggest issue is this: people don't like it. Not all people, just a lot of them. They don't like the VFX. They don't like the way the story is told, or the story itself, any way it could be told. The people have no reason to not like any of it, no reason except their own individual opinions.

The VFX artists and companies, as well as the movie crews in all departments (makeup, costumes, production design and cinematography among them) all do as well as they can. They work hard and long for their pay and the sake of their art. They have control over the look and quality of their movies. But there is one factor that they have no control over: whether any viewer will like it or not. The best artists in the world cannot make an individual like it.

The free world, our free will and freedom of choice, not even ""The Dream Factory"" has much control over it all. Cats has been called a scary-looking movie, but every viewer is able to decide for themselves to accept it or reject it. This ability of ours, one that we usually don't think about much. Try to imagine some kind of movie that could take away from you that very ability. Would such a thing be any less unbearable that a movie like Cats?"
9.0,26 December 2019,I would go see this movie again even if it costed $20/ticket!!! I love it!!! Favorite movie of all time.
10.0,24 December 2019,"Go see it. Open your teeny tiny minds, listen to the words, marvel at the dance, the music and dare I say it the acting! If you've ever seen the theatre production then you MUST see this. If you've not seen it then go with an open mind. The story is simple it doesn't take a genius to understand it. Read the poetry it's based on. Don't just go because Taylor Swift etc is in it. You will hate it if you do."
8.0,24 December 2019,"Of course I can't say the experience was as unforgettable as when I watched the theater version in London Palladium. But the movie is just as good as the original version in terms of its music and play.

There isn't much ""acting"" in it cuz there isn't a real plot, it's just a cinematic adaption of the greatest musical show in history.

Those who review 1 or 2 must lack the intelligence or artistic taste to appreciate real good musical."
9.0,8 January 2020,"I was so incredibly touched by this movie. I just don't understand the hate. The music is so beautiful, the sets are magnificent, and the CGI (or costumes) are perfectly fine. They help you understand the characters as cats. It's so fascinating to learn about all the different ones- and much of it is quite funny. What it is more than anything, though, is a heartbreaking fantasy about what it might be like to be a real cat! If you love musicals there is a great chance you will love this one, too. Don't let anyone discourage you from seeing it. See for yourself how beautiful it is. Also you will not believe how gorgeous the song Beautiful Ghosts is, that was written by Taylor Swift as an original song for the movie. Haunting and gorgeous."
9.0,29 December 2019,"This was brilliant! I can see how people who haven't seen the stage show would have been mildly traumatised by the CGI, but if have seen the real musical and had a real human being playing a cat rub up against you, then it's marvellous!! The music is true to its original form and the spirit is 100% there. Highly recommended - but you should probably watch the stage show production first if you haven't already!"
9.0,31 December 2019,I loved it. Why all the bad reviews. Loved the original Cats songs plus the new one co written by ALW and Taylor Swift. Francesca Hayward's dancing and Jennifer Hudson's singing is worth the entry fee. Musical theatre fans unite and give this a good rating!!
10.0,28 December 2019,"I loved it, the music, the dancing. The Rogers and Hammerstein's music was really brilliant in this movie. The special effects were amazing, making the cats come alive."
10.0,22 December 2019,"I actually loved the movie and took my daughter to see it with me for my bday today. It does start out strange but once you realize this ISN'T a play and is it's own movie it gets so much better. They changed some stuff but i feel like the vocals, dance, and emotion was still there. I liked that it was more than just props and I've been watching the original VHS version for about 20 years. It's my all time favorite play and if I had to choose one song to listen to for the rest of my life I would choose memory. Taylor swift is barely in his movie so I don't get all the negative comments about her and she does a good job imo. And the comments about cats with hands.... Uhhh did you even watch the play? You can see their hands too. Have you never watched an anime? Cat people are adorable lol. Jennifer Hudson did memory justice and I teared up watching her sing it just like every other time I've watched the play. I also liked that they added a bit of humor to some of the scenes. Whole theater was laughing and my 10 year old loved it. I feel like a lot of negative reviews are people who can't accept change or adaptations so they go out of their way to bring a movie down. It's still a good story and has beautiful music with fantastic singers imo."
9.0,25 December 2019,"It's weird. If you're looking for weird, this is it."
10.0,29 December 2019,"Chances are that over 75% of the bad reviews on here are from people who like films like The Joker (worst film of the year in my opinion) and Star Wars (was ok.) I bet most people that saw the movie would never consider going to the theatre to see an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, so why start now? Just stick to the movies you like and don't write such insulting reviews about genres you know nothing about."
8.0,25 December 2019,"Let's take a pole for all the negative reviewers with comments such as '' what were they thinking,'' etc. Of those reviews, ''did anyone read the T.S. Eliot book, and/or see the original stage production of which this movie was based on? I attended a pre-screening before the public opening, and went again on Christmas eve. The improved edit wasn't shown yet. This Cats was quite the undertaking and everyone involved stepped up to the plate, and hit it out of the park! T.S. Eliot's cat character parts were expanded, including updated dance choreography blending classical ballet, contemporary, and hip-hop. Some minor dance improve was missing that were in the stage version however.To expand on Tom Hooper's mention of inclusion. It also touches on abandonment ageism, compassion, empathy, good versus evil. This Cats has all these elements if viewers can see beyond the overwhelming CGI. My favorites scenes began with scenes with the appearance of Old Deuteronomy, Mr. Mistoffelees, the Jellicle Ball sequence reminiscent of Stravinsky's (Martha Grahams) production of The Rite of Spring Pagan dance of the Chosen One, up to the Cats ascension to the Heaviside Layer. I hope to go back a 3rd time to see the CGI edited version that's suppose to be a fix..."
9.0,12 January 2020,"All I can think is that the modern audience must never have heard of TS Eliot, or had his poetry read in school. If people had only read the original poems in advance, maybe they'd know what a Jellicle cat is. I had a 3rd grade teacher who read Macavity the Mystery Cat to us almost weekly, and we loved it!! Maybe they don't teach this stuff any more. And, by the way, the Heaviside layer does actually exist--predicted by Oliver Heaviside, it is an ionized layer in the ionosphere. So TS must have known some atmospheric physics. Ok, school's out--now for the review: Cats wasn't absolutely the best movie I had ever seen, but it certainly isn't worth all the negative reviews. I've seen the musical several times--once in a local community theater, and in the touring show, and the official video, so I think I'm qualified to compare this to the original staging--basically, it was a fun flick. The movie is visually sumptuous--lots of detail to look for. The plot, choreography, and character portrayal has, like in many stage to movie transfers is still quite satisfying, although I found the Macavity plot enhancement a bit forced. Note the billboards and business signage--it is very cat-centric. Details abound in the trash piles. Never mind that sometimes the scale of the sets and props relative to the cats' sizes may change. And why should anyone really care that some cats wear fur coats, as everything is all just fantasy, anyway. Some not-so-convincing singing, but Jennifer Hudson was a knockout singing Memory. And, yes, when I came home from the theater, I hugged my two kitties, knowing that they will never dance or sing like the folks in the movie, but still be loved."
10.0,25 February 2020,Great movie. Don't know why everyone is saying it was bad. You're all crazy.
10.0,29 December 2019,Breathtaking and sparkling fun and dazzling and also magical.
8.0,1 January 2020,"Here's the thing. The CGI is hilarious but this movie is a WHOLE experience. You really have to watch this movie multiple times to understand how truly enjoyable and entertaining it is-I agreed with you guys before I watched it a second time, and just trust me, it's actually not that bad. Learn the soundtrack (which is not bad) and watch it again!"
9.0,23 December 2019,"What a great adaptation on the stage show....... the story is nonsense, (that's the point). The songs are spectacular. The cast gave individually fantastic performances, Rebel Wilson especially. They moved and acted like.... cats. We grew up watching the stage show in person, on video and even a Royal Variety performance and loved this version."
10.0,23 December 2019,"Ok I grant that it may seem creepy to some people at some points. The CGI could be better, but you don't judge a film by one thing. In the broadway show the cats looked like people, but no one gave it terrible ratings. If you like Cats in general you are going to love it, and speaking as a person who worked on a production of Cats, this has actually done better than I thought possible. And also there were over 100 digital artists working on that show, give the a little respect."
9.0,19 March 2020,"I watched the entire movie, waiting for it to be as bad as the reviews suggested... I'm sorry to say that I don't understand all the negative reviews. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, the music, the singing, the dancing, the acting. It was lovely."
9.0,2 January 2020,"If anything this is an example of how easily influenced people are. Brainwashed even. I heard on the radio DJs rubbishing it befor the cast even saw it, and it snowballed.

The movie is what it is, if you

A) don't like musicals

B) don't like cats

You obviously won't like it! However I found it beautifully crafted, well casted, the musical performances were excellent all round and had more soul and emotion than any of the recent Disney Star Wars abominations. It's visually stunning, there have been so many complaints about how the characters look but as I say, it is what it is, it's cats played by humans so it's gonna look like cats played by humans!"
8.0,7 January 2020,"Do the cast of the stage production look strange? Yes, so why is everyone being so negative about them looking strange here?!

Granted, you can't make them look like cats there like you could here but can you imagine this film with ACTUAL cats, it would take so much away from what the musical was supposed to be and look very strange in my opinion. Once you see past the strangeness (this took me about the overture to do - stop being over-dramatic) you see what this film actually is: a fantastic musical brought on to screen by some household names and some incredibly talented stage actors/singers/dancers, most of whom will be relatively unknown to the wider public.

I came out with most of the songs in my head ('Beautiful Ghosts' is a terrific addition), despite reading multiple bad reviews before watching this. I even found that the film made it easier to understand the story as you can hear the words (not always possible in a theatre but is very key for this musical) and it is much more visual than on stage."
8.0,21 January 2020,"I saw this on stage some years back and didn't like it all that much. Didn't understand the story line. The movie is different and I had no trouble understanding what was happening. I found it delightful - impressive sets, wonderful costumes/makeup, beautiful music, great dancing and a charming story. I read the negative user reviews with confusion and then decided perhaps it is a generational thing. Maybe the reviewers are too young to appreciate such an artistic, creative endeavor and sweet story? It was refreshing to watch a movie without any car chases, explosions, or bloody violence."
8.0,23 December 2019,"OK,so yes - the human/cat hybrid thing is just plain creepy. But once you get past that it's really good. Fast paced, paced with songs, amusing - myself, my 12 year old and my 9 year old thoroughly enjoyed it"
10.0,28 February 2020,"The majority of the audience didn't realise what they were about to watch, so that's why they were so disappointed. If you loved the original, you'll love this. It's great. Similar but different to the original. Such a shame it has such bad feedback. It's an Andrew Lloyd Webber... What do you expect from it? It's based on a set of poems. That is portrayed in both the play and this film. And does anyone really understand ballet? If you loved the original 1998 version, this is a must."
8.0,1 January 2020,I was delightfully surprised at the quality of the spectacle. The actors acted like cats. The music was fantastic. The dancing was out of this world. Sure to become a cult classic!
10.0,31 December 2019,"This film is straight off the stage. All the music and craziness people don't seem to get about it is exactly what audiences have loved about it all these decades. It's basically the original stage production with higher end effects. Being familiar with the story and the music going in, I found the movie fun, light, and a great way to bring the magic of Cats to a new generation. All the folks walking into this thing blind, expecting another big budget action film, got confused by the art and simplicity of the story and started hating on it for their own lack of understanding. Sad. This movie deserves so much better treatment than it's received."
8.0,17 February 2020,"I feel as films go Cats is relatively enjoyable, I have no idea what the plot is but it was pleasant to watch with some very talented actors. It's definitely not a film for everyone but I do not feel it deserves the slating it has received"
9.0,3 January 2020,"I just watched the film in the cinema and wanted to post a review but now that I am reading the web and it seems to me I am going to be the only one giving it a high rank.. I don't care, I loved the film. I laughed, I cried while watching, it is a loving simple story which probably one needs to relate to in order to appreciate it. The music was gorgeous, the characters were captivating. To me it was like a fairy tale that brought me back to the childhood and not only. There was a note of optimism in the story and it could have come in the right time for me. Thank you for making this film!"
8.0,14 January 2020,"Ok, first things first. I'm not a bot, and this is my first review here. I just can't believe all the negativity aimed at this film. I've just watched it in my local cinema, and thoroughly enjoyed it, and so it appeared did did everyone else at this viewing. Thre was even some spontaneous clapping and cheering going on. I think there's a lot of bandwagon jumpers about, who just want this film to fail. Don't listen to them. Go and see it, and make up your own mind."
10.0,22 December 2019,
10.0,22 December 2019,"Amazing, beautiful music and dance. Why the bad ratings I don't know. It's a must see film."
8.0,3 January 2020,"Having seen the Broadway and London theater productions in the 1980's, I LOVED this movie production. The cinematography, costuming and makeup, cast, dancing, music and production exceeded my expectations. I also appreciated the story line and cohesiveness of the plot. Highly recommend this!"
9.0,5 January 2020,
9.0,22 March 2020,Exactly what it should be. Haters simply don't appreciate or enjoy plays
10.0,5 January 2020,"This film for me is a good transformation from the original Cats material into the technical media of film. I prefere the musical version and live experience. But I totally found the spirit of the poems, music and dance also in the movie. If people cannot handle lyrics/poetic language, slow stories where the focus lies more on character and to draw them, then on action and obvious plaine story lines...perhaps for those this film is not the right thing to see. But if you are a cineast. If you like the special dimension of 'feeling' a film. If you can laugh about human characters and sillyness reflected in a special world of Cats. Then you will enjoy this film. And yes... I got remembered to all my memories of when I saw the musical on stage many times as a child and teenager. And yes, perhaps the film does not work with this background? But I see the hard work and creativity the team put in this transformation. Changes to the story to offer more dynamic, changes in the songs and also there is the great and correct decision to go with the poetic language and tone. Last but not least the technical effort. The film version I saw was impressive...one small sample: just watch e.g. the cat fur, waving in a slight wind perfectly done. Do not watch this film if you do not like the music, dancing and if you do not like poetic texts. For lovers of phantasy worlds, listeners of the word and dreamer in music this film is recommended. Just to enjoy, and not to ask for the whole sense of life."
10.0,2 August 2021,"I watched this movie and my PP shrinkeded to the size of a cocktail sausage. It was so scary and with out a doubt the best movie I've ever seen in my life, and if you don't agree with me, u a hater. And I mother freakin dab on em haters."
10.0,24 December 2019,"I've never seen the stage play, nor do I know the poems by TS Eliot and I'm not a massive fan of musicals either. I saw a preview while watching another movie recently and I thought, I must go and see this when it's released. That magical song, Memories, is strong enough to carry almost anything along in its path. Idris Elba was almost unrecognisable in his role. Great songs, dancing and some great performances put in by, Idris, Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, Francesca Hayward, Jennifer Hudson (Memories), Laurie Davidson, Taylor Swift, et-al with good cameos from James Corden and Ray Winstone. I thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of what the so-called expert film critics had to say!"
8.0,25 December 2019,Good performances by a majority of the actors. Amazing makeup. Great singing and dance numbers; very entertaining. Only the most jaded folks would give this a score of 1 or 2. See it for yourself.
8.0,9 June 2022,"It is incomprehensible that so many reviewers though this was ""the worst movie ever made."" Perhaps they did not understand that it was a rendition of a book which is a series of affectionate essays about cats by T. S. Elliot. As such, it is not like a conventional narrative with a plot and a climax. Andrew Lloyd Weber gave it a semblance of a plot with the device that an individual cat will be selected to ascend to the Heaviside Layer for rebirth.

This is a lovely fantasy ballet with mythical cat characters and wistful settings in England. Computer graphics is used to create actions, characterizations, and surroundings that could never exist in reality.

One can only suppose that viewers with extreme low opinions of this work must have ulterior motivations unrelated to the film itself. It would be good if those motivations were revealed."
8.0,4 January 2020,"I was worried by all the negativity surrounding this movie but decided to go anyway. I'm glad I did. The CGI had apparently been updated on my visit and frankly I thought it was excellent. This is not iron man this is a stage musical brought to the big screen. Some excellent performances from the cast, notably Jennifer Hudsons emotional performance of memories, was worth the ticket price on it's own. This film does not deserve the bad press. Go and see it yourself and make up your own mind."
10.0,22 May 2021,"I do not refer to anything as ""masterpiece"" lightly. I have watched this movie 4 times, and each time I have only come to appreciate it more. Francisca Hayward, the girl who plays Victoria, is not even a professional actor and yet her portrayal is one of the most beautiful things in this already gorgeous film. The cgi is done masterfully, and the cinematography and choreography is stunning! Also the song that Taylor Swift wrote originally for this version of the musical adds a new dimension to the show. It truly makes me sad that so many are unable to appreciate the spectacle that is Tom Hooper's ""Cats""."
9.0,3 January 2020,"I haven't seen the musical Cats since the 1980's so was very excited to see how they were going to bring it to the big screen.

My expectations were surpassed with an all star cast, improved storyline, an extra song that should be added to the musical production, vocals and dance sequences that make you feel every emotion. You can tell they spent time on getting the cat movements correct and the visual effects only enhanced the actors work.

After seeing it for the second time I realised just how much I missed in the first viewing as there is so much to see on screen at one time.

Thank you Tom Hooper and the rest of the cast, crew and production for doing the musical justice."
9.0,23 December 2019,"Hating this movie will be the new, ""I'm gluten intolerant,"" I see. The hive mind has spoken and all those needing peer validation will jump aboard.

We enjoyed the film quite a bit. It's definitely one-of-a-kind. The singing and dancing is probably not up to Broadway standards but the visual style and sets make up for it.

Jennifer Hudson is no Betty Buckley but she did a good job. Judy Dench was fantastic, as usual, and we actually enjoyed Taylor Swift's performance and added song.

If you like sung-through musicals and/or Andrew Lloyd Webber and/or eclectic art design, you might like this film. If you can't sit still and expect explosions and/or wisecrack comments every ten seconds then stay home."
10.0,2 January 2020,"Don't believe the poor reviews here; it's sad that this magical musical about redemption.is being shredded. I read the poor ratings and stayed home while my family enjoyed the beautiful voices, dancing & costumes, all with tails. See it for yourself!"
9.0,31 December 2019,"My son loves (real) cats and he got that love from me. We went to see the film and we both really loved it! My 9 year old son understood the storyline and the humor that was written into the screenplay. Yes, there could have been SOME improvements, like a black nose and line down to the upper lip and more furry parts of the ""costumes"" (like Grizabella, Old Deuteronomy and Aspara""Gus""). I had never seen it on stage but watched it on YouTube to get a feel for the film. The stage performance left some to be desired. However, Old Deuteronomy is best as a male cat (even though Judi Dench did a terrific job in the role). I loved the signs all throughout the dancing and singing numbers although I am sure I missed some. I WILL be purchasing this film on DVD when it is released. The music was beautiful and the dancing was splendid."
10.0,30 December 2019,It was very entertaining and enjoyable. Everybody is sooo freaking critical of every little thing that isn't perfect.
8.0,27 December 2019,"I have never read such bad and unfair reviews. No respect for the opera, Webber, the director and the cast. Cats has always been an experimental work even in the theater. the CGI that disturbs you so much you have had it under your eyes for twenty years. The negative reviews have gone viral and the film is now destroyed even by those who have not seen it. A perfect boycott in the internet age. Shameful! The film is pop, experimental and full of passion."
10.0,5 January 2020,"It seems to me that A.L.W. does not have the needed sensibilities for his picking film directors or approval of the actors for when his shows switch to film. Madonna ruined EVITA. Phantom was a disaster.Even Jesus Christ was badly adapted to film.As for CATS,I have yet to see, but will at some point.When Ken Russell was in talks to do EVITA and insisted on Liza Minnelli, Mr. Webber would not hear of it. Liza would have been electric, unlike Madonna who clearly phoned it in."
10.0,12 October 2020,"So, I am unironicly giving this movie a 9/10. I personally found it delightful. I love the creepy eerieness of the movements and choreography, the songs are pretty damn good, the ""plotline"" was fascinatingly and entertainingly bizarre, and the lead did a very good job acting singing and dancing wise :). Overall, I found it a delightful, entertaining, chaotic, and interesting experience."
8.0,3 May 2020,Cats is a wonderful help me movie with great Cgi (oh god) and I think fun for the whole family help me please and the songs where entertaining where am I helpmmea plaese
8.0,11 May 2020,Very good adaption of original musical. People need to stop complaining. They see a trailer a write a negative review the music is awsome and the effects. Are really cool. Maybe people should see original then see this one. Anyway i think it's wonderfull.
8.0,17 October 2020,"I hate musicals and I did not particularly like this movie... but... it's exactly what I thought it would be and it's as good/bad as any other musical I've seen.

What the heck were musical lovers expecting? It's fine... it's what a motion picture version of this musical was supposed to look like... so.. why the hate. It's fine.. It's ok...

It's as nonsensical as any other silly musical, except Lala Land which was awesome."
9.0,10 November 2021,Seriously. Were people expecting a serious film here. Eat some mushrooms and watch it and lighten up. It's brightly cored with some funky music. If you liked the stage version you'll enjoy this one. Kinda reminds me of The Wiz a little bit which I also love!
8.0,19 October 2020,"Long and parts boring....loved Victoria, magical cat, Jennifer Hudson!"
9.0,25 December 2019,"Honestly I don't get all the hate and negativity about this. I saw an article this morning commenting about the actors' loss of dignity for appearing in this movie. The only people who should fear for their dignity are the critics and trolls who rushed to judgment long before the movie hit theaters and the ones who followed them like sheep. Huge nasty pile-on. I can understand how Cats isn't to some peoples' taste. I saw the original show on Broadway long ago and wasn't terribly impressed, mainly because the Andrew Lloyd-Webber music is pretty weak. Basing a musical on whimsical T.S. Eliot poetry is high concept from the get-go, but it benefitted greatly from conversion into film, while retaining its theatricality. The costumes and the actors inhabiting them were excellent, especially Francesca Hayward, who was absolutely luminous in the lead role. There were five in our party when we saw the film, including three who hadn't seen the theater version - we all thought it was excellent. I lost not one iota of respect for anyone associated with this film, but my respect for film critics in general has fallen to a new low."
9.0,23 December 2019,A beautiful dance and theatre. I thought it was magical. Don't expect Walt Disney it was musical theatre with all the perks of technology. I've seen the show twice once when a child. When I heard the song memories hairs went up on my arms. The colours were beautiful and so was the dancing. Loved it!
8.0,3 January 2020,"Liked it. I saw it only once before, a TV showing of the stage play. I love love musicals and love cats but it will never be one of my favorites. Which is not to say I didn't cry through Memory. I thought they did a great job with it, making humans look like cats, the sets and backdrops were gorgeous. Still definitely not a favorite, but I don't think it's quite fair to complain about everything that wasn't EXACTLY like the stage play.

9.0,29 December 2019,"It's a musical, with a story told almost entirely through song and dance. It's about a tribe of cats, not a tribe of people. Understand that and enjoy it for what it is, not what you want it to be. I understand that the CGI now in theaters is much improved from the initial release. We thought it was spectacular. If you live with cats, you're already well on your way to enjoying it immensely. If you don't like cats and aren't familiar with their ways, you may not get it all, but the music, lyrics, and dancing is still great."
8.0,5 January 2020,"Were some of the haters possibly hired by competing movie makers or something... I'm pretty sure there are worse movies with incomprehensible messages and cinematography and got more than 6 stars here and there.

I genuinely loved the flawless acting of all the actors and the makers' efforts to leave the theatrical elements alive alongside with special effects only a filmed artwork can provide."
8.0,1 January 2020,"If you love theatre, musicals and quirky children's stories (like Charlie and the chocolate factory) and probably not keen in action/horror genres then this will be a fabulous 2 hours of laughing smiling and sitting on edge of seat invested in the outcomes of these fabulous creations. The signing and dancing is wonderful - singing all the way home !"
10.0,5 January 2020,This movie was a very fun movie for me. I loved the music! It was very true to the play! It is like a hybrid of cg and the stage costumes.
8.0,22 December 2019,"I don't really understand all the negative reviews. Cats is a strange musical in that it is purely based on a collection of poems. You have to accept it is a fantasy and just go with it. I did like the acting, choreography is superb and the visuals are amazing and give so much more to the setting of the piece than the stage show could ever do. The singing is very much done in character - and brings a bit more realism than some musical theatre would. If you don't like musicals - don't bother, and I would go further to say if you don't like the actual premise of the 'Cats' musical don't bother either. If you like both, see it and make your own mind up."
9.0,9 January 2020,
9.0,24 December 2019,"After reading the reviews was expecting to hate this film, but in fact I, my husband & elderly mum may all be in the minority but we all really enjoyed it. Had seen the stage show & weren't great fans but this was a lovely Xmas eve watch."
10.0,22 December 2019,Enjoyed Cats for the music and dance. Costume and make-up were very good. Taylor Swift's contribution was full and her song fell flat compared to others - added to cast for name recognition.
10.0,12 January 2020,"What a beautiful production, even better than the original stage production. Really clever use of CGI and tastefully done. Sets were brilliant, humour great - I grinned through the entire movie except when I cried at the 'new' song which was fabulous. I hate it that the critics didn't like it, what's not to love!"
8.0,25 December 2019,"When saw Cats on Broadway two decades ago, we walked out of the theatre confused as any first timer as to what the heck a Jellicle Cat is. The series of musical numbers attempting to explain it is difficult from the stage. With the movie the settings are flexible and I can say we have more clarity now. I was very impressed with the lead cat Victoria. All the cats' movements draw your eyes like magnets, but Victoria is mesmerizing. Had to look up that she is an accomplished ballet dancer. Just like when I saw the musical 20 years ago, I still think Memory and the Mr. Mistoffelees songs are the strongest, but in the movie I'm able to appreciate the weaker numbers as well. If you hate this movie, I recommend avoiding the play as well. It's the same exact story. I'm of the opinion the movie is far more approachable for most people. And for me far more enjoyable."
10.0,6 February 2020,"This movie was so good! I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT THE WHOLE TIME, AND I HOPE THEY MAKE A SUQUEL!!!!"
10.0,15 January 2020,"This is not a David Attenborough documentary, it's musical theatre with great singers who are well cast, (the clarity of the lyrics is better than most), some ballet and the occasional laugh out loud wisecracks. The CGI is fine, yes they look like people in fancy cat suits, what did you expect? It's better than the London stage production or the DVD. This feeding frenzy of bad reviews makes no sense. Go and see it for yourself..."
8.0,24 December 2019,"Firstly I've never written an review before but had to due to all the negativity around this film. I understand that it won't be to everyone's taste as Cats its not your average musical but if you compare it to it's predecessor the it's brilliant. The fact the had the budget to go bigger and more realistic then you could ever do on stage is a fantastic achievement. The celebrity appearances may not be vocally as impressive as the stage verity but they add there own energy and make the role there own. People that complain of the lack or story should see the original before they moan. For people that like the original I'd say go see it it's a big budget reimagining of the classic, for people that are going into it first time I'd suggest doing some research first!"
10.0,26 December 2019,"This movie is NOT that bad like everyone says. I've seen the stage show twice and never understood it..... seeing the movie, now I understand the story.....the choreography was great! Saw it on Christmas Day and theater I was at was a full audience"
9.0,12 February 2020,"I have long enjoyed the musical 'Cats', both in several attendances at live productions and simply listening to the music on CD. 'Cats', the movie, was created in 1997, a full 16 years after its debut on stage. This isn't simply the taping of a stage performance. For the movie they assembled the best cast they could from among 'Cats' stage veterans. The set was designed especially for the movie, the makeup was toned down to look better in the closer perspective of the movie, especially the close-ups, a full orchestra was used, songs were recorded in a studio, and conventional movie techniques were used for the filming -- multiple angles, close-ups, cameras moving on tracks, etc. What we get is a movie that is does not have the realism of a stage production, and it is fairly obvious most times that singers are lip-syncing their own recordings, but a movie nonetheless that is a superb supplement to the live performances. The DVD has a very nice 'making-of' special, we see Andrew Lloyd Weber personally supervising the musical numbers, we see some of the makeup artistry at work, and a few before/after shots of actors and their characters.

Overall a fine DVD of a superb movie of perhaps the most entertaining stage musical of all."
10.0,19 January 2020,I just don't get why people hate this movie and why they loved La La Land. It was terrific. And way better then La La Land!
8.0,11 January 2020,"This film feels like two in one. Let me explain:

The first half is a bit strange. Jason Durelo and a lot of milk (take that as you will), Rebel Wilson and her singing mice/roaches, James Corden and his.....weirdness. That is all pretty darn weird.

However, power through that weirdness and you get to the second half which is really enjoyable. You get the good songs (Mr Mistoffelees, The Jellicle Ball, Gus: The Theatre Cat, etc) with some hard-hitting moments and you would even find me smiling/laughing.

Yes seeing Judi Dench raising her legs up in delight is a bit strange, yes the CGI feet glitch and yes there are human hands here, there and everywhere. However, you will be left with a smile on your face. Honest"
8.0,3 January 2020,"Having never seen the stage version of Cats, I had no preconceived ideas about the plot, characters, or music (other than I liked the music with which I was familiar). I found the cast performances riveting, the story engaging, and the music delightful. Yes, it does require some effort on the part of the audience (Gasp) to actually use your imagination and adjust your perspective to that of an actual cat!"
8.0,26 December 2019,"No spoilers!

Maximizing every penny of its unexplainably low $95MM budget, this destined for Best Picture nominee was able to take an aged-musical with a cast of up-and-commers (none better than introducing Judi Densh as one of the cats) to unexplainable heights. Cats (the movie) takes you on a journey, showcasing a fierce depiction of a cat's life, struggling to prance from a counter to a shelf.

Most people know the story of cats simply as a clowder of felines deciding which cat is the best and will ascend to later return to a new cat life. Most people are idiots. Experiences in abandonment, owning mistakes, and chasing your former glory are masterfully covered in this adventure without direction. As a viewer, you are lucky to be rewarded with an opportunity to try and fill in the multiple story holes.

At the end of the day, this hiss-torical fiction shows us a community will rally around the most beautiful cat because they deserve it. Only reason Cats doesn't receive a 10/10 is because I'm not a big musical guy."
9.0,28 December 2019,
10.0,27 August 2023,"Awesome songs. CGI better than most modern movies. I really don't understand why the sight of cat people evokes such fear or disgust in people. I even heard opinions that this movie sexualizes cats but I didn't notice it. Maybe because I have cats myself and I don't see anything sexy about them.

The way they danced, like humans but with grace of cats. The way the ears move matches the facial expression. I can't say one bad word about that movie. This is just masterpiece, from begining to end.

Plot is a bit confusing for me, who are jellicle cats, be it a different species or a lifestyle or a group name... What is this all about second life thing and magic? But this is musical after all, it's about dancing and singing, not deep multi-threaded twist of events."
8.0,4 January 2020,"I have seen Cats twice on stage (once in the West End) and loved it both times. I absolutely loved the movie! It took me on an emotional rollercoaster- laughter, gooseflesh and tears. I loved the sets, the music, the cgi and the performances! The casting was brilliant, the actors all suited their parts. I truly cant wait to watch it again. This is a movie for musical theatre lovers."
9.0,1 January 2020,"I can't believe the low rating this is getting. It's a wonderful and enjoyable experience. Very well made and you can tell love had been put into this production. I have never seen the play live, so this was an opportunity to see Cats and my family and I had a great time. Give it a try and decide for yourself. I am not very fond of musicals myself, but I give this 8 out of 10."
10.0,25 December 2019,"Ok. So here's the deal.

Yes, it's Cats: the notorious musical. Yes, at its core, it's a bunch of people dressed up pretending to be cats. Yes, it is what it is, and it's incredibly campy and pointless. And yes, I do have a bias in favor of Andrew Lloyd Webber and his works.

That being said, I absolutely loved this film. I'm completely serious; I really loved it.

This adaptation provided a little more cohesion and story to the script, which really helped me follow certain characters and certain objectives. I loved how they fleshed out the character of Victoria more to be a true central figure we can follow, and it made the Jellicle Choice at the end very impactful.

The greatest thing about the film was the performances. Jennifer Hudson truly brought her A game not just with her vocal chops, but to her characterization of Grizabella. Judi Dench brought a wonderful sense of warmth and comfort with her old Deuteronomy. Francesa Hayward absolutely shined in her debut role as Victoria, and her skills as a ballerina were effortless and impeccable. Other highlights were Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap and his dancing prowess, Rebel Wilson as the clumsy Jennyanydots, and even Jason Derulo giving us some smooth vocals as Rum Tum Tugger.

The true highlight for me was Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. In a very ""meta"" role for him playing an old, but not necessarily faded star of the stage, he showed once again why he is one of the absolute legends of acting. And he did it all dressed as a cat.

The aspect I loved most is that everyone was so incredibly dedicated and committed to what they were doing. These are all world class artists at the top of their game. They could have phoned it in knowing what a travesty it could be, but instead, they gave their all and told the story like artists are supposed to.

Not that the film didn't have its flaws, of course. The CGI could have been much better, but it didn't detract from the experience for me. Taylor Swift was very underwhelming singing ""Macavity the Mystery Cat"", and Idris Elba just didn't mesh with the role of Macavity.

I would ask that all the naysayers and skeptics who have not seen it to go in with a fresh perspective while also fully accepting what you're getting into. You might be able to see the true beauty and dedication of the work presented on screen."
10.0,2 January 2020,"Some of the reviews on this site are a bit harsh to say the least. I have to be honest and say that the first 20 mins was pretty hard going if your not a die hard Lloyd Webber, tap dancy type, which I'm not, however, after about 20 mins or so it turns from a mediocre west end musical into a very good, moving film which is very well acted, and the costumes are superb. So, for me, what was wrong with the first 20 minutes or so? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps there was just too much dancing which didn't move the story on, which can make it drag, but I have to say when the intensity of the dancing backed off and the story and drama picked up, it was quite superb and I came out of the cinema having thoroughly enjoyed it. So, in a nut shell, get through the first 20 mins and you will enjoy it."
8.0,19 May 2020,This movie is a disaster. Everything about it is insane and terrifying. I gotta tip my hat to Tom Hooper though. I didn't think a movie could be so scarily bad. Congrats dude. I went twice.
9.0,19 September 2020,This is a movie you put on your watch it once and never again list lol.
8.0,27 June 2020,"People who are saying ridiculous things like ""this is the worst movie I have ever seen"" says much more about them than it does about this movie.

I've seen the play twice, a while ago, and the movie's ability to portray the music so well, to extend the quality of the scenes, and to knit a story together using Victoria was terrifically creative work. Watching the dancing, even seeing what the CGI folks did with ears, tails, and fur, and how well everything was put together was phenomenal. I never took my eyes off the screen. Thee was so much to see, watching how every scene was staged, how the movements were blocked, and the performance of individual actors were all excellent.

Right, Judi Dench is not a great singer, but neither is the Old Deuteronomy character. Ian McKellan was wonderful in his spot, Jennifer Hudson better than anticipated, Rebel Wilson and James Corden really good choices letting their personalities come through, Steve McRae fascinating through his number, and Idris Elba a more involved Macavity than in the play. This doesn't even mention Francesca Hayward and the many excellent dancers who had background roles.

But the thought and work that Tom Hooper, the choreographer, and the set director, achieved for this movie were exceptional.

If someone is too young or too stupid to understand the story or to suspend belief to go into the world of cats, or gets spooked by seeing CGI fur and people moving like great dancers trying to emulate cats, or just wants to pretend to be ""cool"" and rip the production that's on them and a matter of a lack of understanding. Much the same way I can't understand why a person would watch a movie while drunk, but, obviously, those people did."
9.0,10 January 2020,"Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" & the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. Jason Derulo is lots of fun as the singing & dancing & catnip-to-kittens Rum Tum Tugger. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat. There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S. A quick comment on the ""trailers"" ~ having seen the complete movie, I feel sorry for those whose jobs were to create 3-minute trailers to communicate the merits of this movie. The film contains so much more than can be squeezed into a trailer."
8.0,23 October 2021,"I absolutely loved this film - but then I adored the stage show enough to see it three times. To me this is nothing more than a bigger, crazier version of the one in theatre, with more fantastic sets, better choreography and some really good turns by big name actors.

Sure you have to get past the human/cat hybrid thing, but I just viewed it as taking the already wild costumes from the stage to the next level. Taylor Swift's take on Macavity is the definitive one for me too.

The only thing stopping it from getting 10/10 is Idris Elba's Macavity costume - that is creepy AF!!!"
8.0,4 June 2021,"Slick, stylish, very entertaining. Dame Judy an absolute scene stealer, which is saying something giving the superb performances of the rest of the cast. Will never bother with the stage version again as it will always be a disappointment."
8.0,13 December 2022,"I really enjoyed this film. I watched it with my children who absolutely love it and we rewatch it regularly, alongside listen to the soundtrack on a regular basis.

I wonder if many of the reviewers are familiar with the musical? As I am not and maybe this would change my opinion? However I am very familiar with the poems of TS Elliot which the lyrics of the songs are based on. The plot is nuts but the dancing is fantastic and I love the costumes - much better than the stage version!

My only criticism is that the editing is so quick and sharp that you aren't able to fully appreciate the choreography and some of the English accents are a bit hilarious. But overall very entertaining!"
10.0,10 June 2021,I watched this because i love Taylor swift!!! And i love catss after watching this movie i felt like this is sp Good but got flopped i felt bad for that.
8.0,11 April 2020,"It's a gift to the senses. A marvelous, creative , touching story told by a wonderful cast in a beautiful, detailed Musical. I am so happy that I didn't pay attention to the reviews and decided to watch it. What a pleasure!!"

8.0,3 March 2020,
8.0,26 December 2019,"Saw this with my wife and daughter on Christmas. We had been looking forward to it, and we were not disappointed. Very similar to the stage play, but with a few plot lines added to give the shallow story a little more depth. Songs were performed well, but lacked the emotion and 'wow' that the live show provided. James Cordon and Rebel Wilson were funny, but Judi Dench is probably miscast as Old Deuteronomy. We were entertained."
8.0,2 January 2020,"To be clear, I am a big fan of musicals in general and know the stage version of Cats well enough to have been looking forward to this film when it was announced.

When the trailer was released I didn't see the problem that everyone else did. The characters didn't look exactly like cats, but they never really did in the stage version either. It is this mindset that seems to have allowed me to enjoy the film while others have been unable to get passed how unlike cats the characters appear.

Does it look real? No. But it didn't bother me. There are no other characters apart from a human silhouette to compare them to. Whereas the unrealistic elephant in the recent dumbo remake who was sharing the screen with human actors just stood out like a sore thumb.

The songs are as good as they've ever been and the new song fit in well and is now on repeat in my brain. My fears the Rebel Wilson and James Corden would outstay their welcome and becoming annoying were unfounded and i ended up mostly enjoying their scenes.

I assumed Jenifer Hudson's rendition of Memory would not be able to hit in the same way as Elaine Page but once again I have to admit I was wrong and that I did get teary eyed during the reprise.

The only fault I noticed was the inconsistent scaling of the characters who at some times felt much smaller than real cats and then other times seeming much bigger.

I've seen a lot of people call it boring and I have no idea why. Were they bored by the dancing scenes without songs? Did they not like the songs? I wasn't bored and at no point felt the film was dragging.

Having heard the initial response to this film I was waiting for the moment when I suddenly saw why so many people seem to hate this film. That moment never came for me. I really enjoyed it and will happily watch it again."
8.0,26 October 2021,"People nowdays are so afraid to go against the crowd its so annoying...

This movie is not a 10/10...ok but it is NOT a 1/10

its easy....if you liked the musical and you loved the musical video that was released you will LOVE this movie

if your 28 or younger and have no idea what is this musical you never were a fan of the musical cats and you dont know the songs this movie is NOT for yoy.

Ao i think one of the main things is the crowed base of this movie is very little...becaouse ita obviosly made for 35+ years old people who were fans of cats.

And even in that 35+ years old you needed to be a fan of cats so not most.

Actually very few people.

Yea it doesnt explain the story so good (also the musical didnt)... it doesnt make sense at times

but for ME as a really big fan of cats just seing this songs in video was enough to be an enjoyable movie.

It is far from a 1/10 i think what happned is

most young people dont know cats.

And they are the ones who rate in internet sites like imdb

also there is a thing where most people gave it 1/10 so it will be wierd or outcasted to give this a good score.

And im sure the makers of this movie knew that which made making this movie (for the real cats fans) very bullsy move.

And for that they have my respact."
10.0,28 December 2019,"If you have not seen the broadway performance of Cats, then you have no purpose in writing a review that is even the slightest bit accurate to the truth. As a Cats fan, and someone who has actually seen the original performance, this motion picture did an excellent job in portraying the meaning and message of Cats. Jennifer Hudson was incredible, and Rebel Wilson had my companions and I dying of laughter. Andrew Lloyd Webster should be extremely proud of Tom Hooper's adaptation of the masterpiece. For those of you who have said this movie isn't worth seeing and that your kids didn't like it, I doubt you or your children have understood the broadway original correctly. On another note, introducing our Victoria, Francesca Hayward did an incredible job as our main feline. Congratulations to the entire Cast and Crew on an extraordinary creation."
10.0,1 January 2020,"I had seen "" Cats"" as a stage play many years ago. I think that the movie is as wonderful, as was the play. Frances Hayward, as the character, Victoria, was a great addition to the story. The ratings of the movie have not been great; but knowing T.S. Elliot's poem and knowing Andrew Lloyd Weber's music made for a great movie."
10.0,22 December 2019,If you head to the cinema to watch Cats and expecting Die Hard or Disney then you bound to be disappointed. Cats is a stage show and one I didn't quite get until seeing the Film. Yes it lacks the sweeping landscapes of Les Misérables but this was a stage show about alley cats set in London. It's was a stage production on a round stage. This film brings that stage show to life once again and puts it on a bigger stage with more sets. I feel sorry for the reviewers who obviously lack the experience of seeing the show live or reading TS Elliot. So be quite the critic who enjoys the latest Marvel and I implore anyone with an ounce of intelligence to head to the cinema and enjoy this as much as I did.
10.0,11 February 2024,"Love this movie! We all came together to watch it at a themed party, but was honestly disappointed in the lack of cat butthole. :( Hope cats 2 has butts!

Also i think the budding romance between rumtum tugger and mcavity was really down played. I expected a broadway movie adaptation to be more inclusive. Its really disappointing, john corden and idris elba have insane chemistry on screne and i won't stand by as their love is squandered. On the upside though, it was nice to have a preview of tay tay's eras tour, hope she sings Shake it Off with Selena in the next one. #jellicalforlife #judydench2024."
9.0,11 October 2020,"Not having seen the Broadway production I can look at the movie with an open mind! I felt the sets and costuming was well done. On the songs the only one that touched me was ""Memories"". I was very pleased to see so many wonderful actors taking on the costume and the dancing. I would watch it again!

Peter Petretich"
9.0,22 January 2020,"So I finally watched ""Cats"". And I'm going to have a seemingly unpopular opinion: it's one of the better film-musicals made recently! I suspect that the thing that people have a problem is the ""uncanny valley"". Well... I am familiar with the stage musical (and a video-version of it) since I was a kid, really. And I do like it, I used to dance to it in front of a TV and had a small poster by my desk. And I should also probably say, that I always treated it similar to sci-fi or fantasy. Because it is! It is set in a world, where there are humanoid cats. And magic. They are not cats that we know. They are alien cats. They walk on two legs, have human-like faces and like singing and dancing. And some of them can do magic. Going into the film with this (to me very obvious) assumption, their look is just a given.

The SGI is... mostly good. The only problem is that they are often a bit ""floating"", not quite standing on the ground. Slightly distracting, but not majorly. Were the Composite artists rushed in the end to they didn't have time to fix this? I suspect so.

Story is, in my opinion, very much improved. There is now an ""audience perspective"" character - a new cat, Victoria, so we can discover this world of ""jellicle cats"" with her and follow her journey. A few other characters are fleshed out: Mr. Mistoffelees has a visible story ark, Gus the Theatre Cat has an awesome resolution instead of just disappearing after his song, it is explained why everyone hates Grisabella, and Macavity has a reason for lurking around and disrupting the ball beyond ""because he's eeeeevil"". The only thing I missed compared to the stage version was a bad-ass fight between Munkustrap and Macavity. Because that made Munkustrap into a real badass. Actually, I'd say his character was slightly toned down overall. He is more of a guide, rather that a leader and protector. I personally liked the stage version more, but this is just a personal preference here.

The humour is also mostly good, a lot of funny moments, more than in the original.

The actors are good. Really, really good, actually. Especially Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson). I mean, everyone. But... yeah, in this version the Magical Cat leaps from ""one of the favourites"" to ""the favourite"" character. (In the stage-version-video Munkustrap overshadowed him a bit for me).

Oh, and... they can sing! I know, there shouldn't be a reason to mention this in a musical. It seems obvious that the actor should be able to both sing and act (and dance in this case) at the same time to be cast in a musical. But the recent track record for ""films-musicals"" has been... not so good. Well... there you go."
8.0,28 December 2019,"Yes it is true that if you are use to the original Cats Musicals, on stage and filmed stage version, this one will freak you out but in a very delightful way. I have seen staged Cats and the filmed stage version is my go to movie for workouts dance routines, as with any Andrew Llyod Webber musical. I enjoyed every moment ignoring the creepy bits of cats in shoes and the miscasting of Jason Derillo as Rum Tum Tigger lead feet and heavy weighted movents and dragging voice. He cant sing or dance but even but, i am a crazy cat lady also (Rebel Wilson). I loved this musical! Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy was beautiful. Ian mckellen as Gus the theater cat was clap worthy. They really brought their formal clasical acting talent. I clapped. Laurie Davidson as the magical mystical Mr. Mistoffelees just pulled me in and captured the audience support at his failed magical attempts. Jennefer Hudson plays a really good tragic figure as Grizabella. She did in Dream Girls and we all cried. Let's admit that although we don't want to. The girl is getting a Oscar this year. Idris Elba put his traditional theater talent to use and was the perfect Macativity. Even Taylor Swift was wonderful and people can go back to hating her afterwards but she showed her true talent. I chose to stop hating long enough to appreciate good talent. Rebel Wilson was surprising good cast and really captivated the audience with her roll as Jennyanydots. I left this movie wanting to dance and sing. I absolutely loved it, I can forgive the flaws."
10.0,12 January 2020,"I got exactly what I expected when I went to see this movie....a musical with plenty of great singing and dancing. My friend and I both really enjoyed it! At one point, it even brought us to tears when Grizzabella sang the second time. Everyone clapped when it ended. The ears, whiskers, and tails on the cats actually moved realistically, which made it very cool! For everybody rating this a 1 and claiming Hollywood has no soul, what the heck were you EXPECTING when you went to see this movie?!? If you've seen the play Cats, it's the exact same thing except with some cool animation features added in! You're insulting Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, not Hollywood's! Seriously, don't you do any research before you go to see a movie?!?"
9.0,13 January 2020,"The film is an adaptation of a Broadway musical. The Broadway musical is poetry, written specifically for children, put to music, dance and acting. I feel that, in this context with which one should use one's imagination and bring out one's ""inner child"", this movie may quite possibly be as mesmerizing as the Broadway musical."
9.0,29 December 2019,"The only reason I'm not giving this 10/10 is because it's objectively a poorly-done film. But I still give it a 9 because it is so absurd, befuddling, and bizarre that I couldn't help but enjoy this glorious disaster of a movie. Between the truly enjoyable music and the film's ability to bring me to tears (with laughter), I can't say that I hate it or that I don't intend to watch it multiple times throughout my life. Truly a cult classic in the making."
9.0,25 December 2019,"I absolutely loved this movie!! The costumes and makeup were spot on!! I would definitely sea it again and recommend you do too, don't listen to the bad reviews, they are all just sour pusses!!"
10.0,24 December 2019,"Absolutely amazing!!

Cast outdid themselves to bring cats from stage to movies.

FYI don't bother seeing if you don't like musical as you certainly won't appreciate it. This movie is everything you expect from a Musical"
9.0,3 February 2020,"My wife and I saw Cats (2019) for the first time last night. Since the ratings are so terrible, I didn't have my hopes up. However, I must say, I truly feel sorry for every single person who have this film a negative review. It is clear that you don't know Cats and you don't appreciate good art on screen. If you don't understand Cats, if you don't appreciate Andrew Lloyd Weber, if you don't recognize the brilliant CG artistry behind this film, if you don't care about Tony Awards or the fact that this was the fourth longest running show on Broadway, or if you simply don't have good taste, go ahead and give this beautiful film a bad review- we won't hold it against you."
8.0,3 January 2020,Just phenomenal. And remember: a cat IS NOT a dog. bye.
10.0,4 January 2020,I love love loved this move so so so much. the cats were so artistic and they all danced so good. Cats is by far the best movie I've ever seen.
9.0,6 January 2020,"Having seen the original west end version as a child I was really looking forward to this but after seeing so many negative reviews a little worried I wouldnt like it, but if you can look past the CGI and set sizing issues which we did we were soon emersed in the wonderful music of cats. Personally I really liked it, the touch of humour and new characters and songs I think helped younger audiences as the original was a little tricky to follow. But I think this version set the story well and if you like a musical definatly worth a watch in our view. Me and my daughter walked out singing the songs and looking forward to a DVD in the future."
10.0,15 April 2020,A great family movie! The choreography and costumes are incredible!
8.0,18 January 2020,"For anyone who takes the time to research the original book of poetry and the Broadway production of this title, they will find a fine film adaptation of an art piece that most film goers will never understand. No, there is no high action. No, there is no sexual innuendo, no, there is no Hollywood tagline or payoff. Instead, its a poetic, dance-filled adaptation that pays homage to its origins, with a nice touch of film story-telling to fill the large screen. If I had a fine piece of art in my house, I would enjoy it privately, knowing that most people might just not see the beauty of its value. My wife and I enjoyed every minute of this film and were grateful for the artists who took the time to do it right, adding just enough film fanfare to bring it up to date. And if the common film-going audience doesn't get it, that leaves more for those of us who appreciate a wonderful theatrical moment. Bravo!"
9.0,15 April 2020,My kids absolutely loved this movie i don't understand the hate on the whole movie. So what if the cgi is terrible? The movie is fun and haunting in a good way I'd watch it again!
9.0,18 January 2020,"I went in to see a bad film for fun. I came out changed. I did not see a bad film, I saw an amazing film with great songs, super talented dancers, and overall this viewing was a huge positive win! I hope more people can enjoy this film the way I did instead of being so harsh on what is a great fun musical."
10.0,30 January 2020,"I think everybody got a bit too carried away with all the bad reviews. It's like a competition - who's gonna come up with the worst. While the CGI really is rather poor and unfinished, the rest looked pretty okay to me. What's more, I even loved the dancing and the singing. It's obvious that a lot of effort, time and soul went into the making of this movie and it's not fair to ignore that. Tom Hooper is a brilliant director - maybe he should have had more patience and waited a few more years before he made that movie, that's true. But the film is not hideous, nor more cringe worthy than The Shape of Water for example (I personally hated that one). Overall, I would give it a 6 because I am not a fan of movies with little to no plot, but I want to help up its rating, so an 8 it is. If you love musicals, give it a try despite the bad reviews. Give yourself a chance to form your own opinion."
8.0,6 January 2020,"Ok, first & foremost, I consider myself to be a cinephile & lover of all genres of films (except Western cowboy crap), Broadway & off-Broadway plays, musicals, theatre productions...you get the point. Also, I am in no way affiliated in any way with the production studio, nor marketing for this film. I own the live play recorded in '98, love it, and I LOVED this film also!! The CGI is a bit different, but the hybrid imagery of cat & human is phenomenal!! And Francesca Hayward, a Principal ballerina with London's Royal Ballet, no less, is phenomenal in this!! Don't pay any attention to half these reviewers that likely didn't even watch this, I will definitely be getting the Collectors Edition Blu-ray for my collection... absolutely fabulous film!!"
8.0,7 September 2020,"Why so many hate this film? Because they dont like the costumes? It makes no sense that the stage musical is loved by everyone but this film is hated. It has the same music, the same story, the same carachters. So if you like the musical, you also like this film."
8.0,11 October 2020,It Gents beter Evert time i watch it. There are so many beautiful moments.
9.0,31 December 2019,"Not sure what people expected to see but we went along expecting a film with people pretending to be cats and singing and dancing and that is exactly what we got.

Slightly different from the stage show or the T S Eliot book, but only to allow the creation of a film.

The actors were really good and well cast. Gus and Grizelda both brought a tear to my eye.

Yes, it's not your average film but then again the stage show is not your usual musical.

We really enjoyed it from start to finish."
8.0,12 January 2020,"I don't get why so many 20-40 year old men are giving this movie such bad reviews! Lets be honest, they seem to get hurt with quite a few movies that are aimed at the child or female demographic. I saw the theatre show of Cats in London when I was about 7 years old and I loved it. This musical film is very similar to the theatre show. The plot isn't that clear - you have to really listen to the words of each song to really understand what's happening but that is how it was always written. Ian McKellen makes an amazing cat! The singing is good, Grizabella is amazing (and that's saying something given I saw Elaine Page live perform that character and the iconic song Memories), Judy Dench is great in her role. The CGI is good. The only thing I was missing was the Cats coming off stage and dancing & running amongst the audience. I would recommend giving it a chance."
9.0,23 July 2021,"I have not seen the stage play yet for comparison but this film is amazingly well done. Everything is spot on for the effect of the cats. The human portrayal, special effects.... All very well done. The few one star reviews I've read seem to totally disregard that this is a film adaptation of theatre, which is different all together from simply being ""a movie"" in my opinion. Theatre actors are required to do A LOT more than look pretty and cry on demand."
10.0,3 January 2020,"A spectacle, full of joy. Great music, great dancing. Watching this was an absolute delight."
9.0,30 December 2019,"I went with my 12 year old daughter and we both loved it. The singing was amazing and the dancing spectacular. They have had to make some changes for the film version but it works fine, we both like the theater show as well. The effects did not seem any stranger than the actors in their full make up for the show. Fans should see for themselves what its like and leave the negativity behind. Well done guys!"
9.0,1 January 2020,Having seen the stage play I thought this was good. The stage play had very little plot and was carried by the music and dancing. The music and dancing are as good as the stage play...only concern was that Memory was sung with a little too much emotion. We all enjoyed watching the movie.
9.0,4 January 2020,"It is not often I feel the need to post a review on IMDB, but after reading all the negative remarks and seeing Cats last night I felt duty-bound. The sets, dancing, and cats themselves are visually stunning - not to mention personable, beautiful and obviously dedicated to giving extremely heartfelt performances.

Francesca Hayward as the new young cat (Victoria) binding the story together (a stroke of genius) was mesmerizing and has to be the most gorgeous face to be seen on the screen since Zoe Saldana in «Avatar»). She is also an incredible singer and dancer and worth the price of the ticket alone.

Other fantastic adaptations were Skimbleshanks - the railway cat, Ian McKellen as Gus - the Theatre cat, and a surprisingly bold move using Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. I would have given the film a 10 except for the fact that I thought Rebel Wilson's singing (Jennyanydots - otherwise another great scene) could have benefited from autotune.

In conclusion, if you like Cats - the musical, I don't see how you could be disappointed by this wonderful and-state-of-the-art cinematic production. The portrayal of the cats is spellbinding. The CGI and spectacular scenes are mesmerizing and the singing and dancing are all one could hope for in a modern day musical.

Forget the negative reviews, most of which aren't really «reviews» at all.... «my grand-mother cried in the bathroom for two hours»........» This is paraphrasing, but when such comments get 150 «helpful» likes, one has to wonder who is doing the reviewing, and who is doing the liking. I give it a score of 8.5!"
10.0,30 December 2019,"The movie started weird but you got used to it after a while. I loved it! I had seen the theatre production of it on dvd and my mum had seen it in theatre twice and we both enjoyed it so much. We were really impressed in how they did it and how the effects worked, I recommend it to any cats fan."
8.0,31 December 2019,"In a short and simple review, Cats is not what all the nay-sayers are making it out to be. 8 stars for the recut version, a noticable improvement over the original that would have 7 stars. Cats is strange and different, but it fits the strange-and-different trend in recent movies. Cats has more than the usual amount of strange and different, but not as much as the harsher critics claim. Not bothering with the film's quality or details, I'll just leave well enough alone.

Except for one minor detail hardly worth mentioning. One crucial flaw. The single worst thing about this movie as well as all other Hollywood fare. It's budget. To be more precise, the budgetary ways and means of Hollywood.

Given it cost $100,000,000 to make Cats, it cost another hundred million to distribute and advertise. The average cinema ticket, however much it costs, has to have at least 50% going to the cinema that shows Cats, with no more than 25% going to Universal Pictures. Cats could make a profit if it grosses more than $400,000,000. It has grossed around a tenth of that, but this is only its 10th day of its first run. Cats might break even in 3-6 months, considering it can profit from home video release.

Compare this business to the Rise of Skywalker: its budget of $275,000,000 requires a gross of $1.1 billion before profit shows up. Is it anywhere near that yet? Can Disney deny a loss of their own in the hundreds of millions?

The Hollywood money system, if not broken, is built to break movies. In a previous decade, a movie's cost of distribution and marketing would amount to no more than 25% of its production cost. This was when movies came on reels of 35mm film. Digital technology is the current medium of the movies, so should it not cost less to distribute and exhibit? The cinemas need not take as much percentage of their tickets, and they would still make more than enough of their own profit to pay their workers well and maintain their venues well.

In a more sensible world, no movie would have to gross four times it budget (if not five or six!) to begin to make money for its studio, since the profiteers who want their money up front would settle for sensibly smaller amounts. Why would Universal or Disney demand so much money to distribute digital video files to cinemas? Who would Universal and Disney have to pay so much money to for the digital services? Why would not a major studio consider a distribution and marketing cost as part of a movie's production budget? Or pay for such out of their own bank accounts, since the major studios are capable of doing so with ease?

This miserly money-grubbing stinginess at multiple levels is what tilts the playing field against the good people who do honest work to make the movies as good as they are, and more good people's honest work to keep the movie venues as good as they are."
10.0,30 December 2019,I'm a fan of musicals but really didn't like the stage show of cats. However this blew me away! I laughed and cried at this. Jennifer Hudson was simply amazing . Such a feel good movie. Would watch again
10.0,21 December 2019,"As a watcher of this film without a need to follow the media critics, I found this film very enjoyable. Yes, at first I thought the faces on CGI graphics a little quirky, but I saw through to the joy of what Cats is meant to be. A celebration of T. S. Eliot's feline friends. No, it's not perfect (yes I resisted), but it is a homage on the silver screen. Dame Judy Dench and Sir Ian McKellan are delightful; the young upstarts maybe don't capture the spirit of Cats the musical because unlike those above, the stage is not in their blood. This is ultimately what this has to be, a stage show on the silver screen. It was always going to fail in one respect; it's not the on the stage! What it does do is introduce the characters to a younger generation through their stars, such as Jason Derulo and Taylor Swift. It also gives access to those who don't usually go to shows on stage. For this I applaud the creators of this film, maybe they knew they might get a verbal hiding by the press and stage aficionados. See this film through innocent eyes, and you are in for a treat!"
8.0,17 March 2023,"Like the heading says, this this movie is a classic! I would put it in the same category as Titanic. Like Titanic, not only was the directing top notch, but the acting was deserving of an Oscar or BAFTA. Thank you for writing a masterpiece. I seriously don't understand why this movie has received such poor reviews. I would at least expect a rating of 8.2 and metascore of 84. I can only recommend that you watch it at least once. The acting is beautifully performed and beautifully choreographed. Definitely worth watching. This movie would not be such a classic without the beautiful storyline and quality acting from all. Do yourself a favour and watch it!"
10.0,29 December 2019,"So I went to this with a friend, both of us expecting to MST3K our way through the whole thing; the previous day, the theatre's manager was confronted by an elderly woman who was irate because the rest of the scanty audience had been doing exactly that, and she wanted a pass for a future date as a result. Needless to say, my hopes were on the seriously low end, and I was pretty much expecting a complete dumpster fire of a film. BUT...

...what do you know? It actually turned out to be surprisingly GOOD! Yes, I was totally sober throughout, and am more than familiar with both good and bad films in such as a way as to be able to tell one from another, and I""m telling you, CATS was actually pretty damn good! Yes, seeing CGI fur on human beings definitely takes some time getting used to (although it was the tails and ears that made me twitch more than the fur itself), but I *did* get used to it surprisingly quickly. Part of my brain kept wondering ""Is *this* where it all goes to hell?"", but no, that never happened --it just kept on going its merry way, taking me and my friend (who agrees with me, but doesn't spend much time on IMDB) with it.

More specific comments: The acting: Everyone did a perfectly respectable job with their characters; Francesca Heyward was a most charming and sweet-natured ingenue, Idris Elba was wonderfully fiendish as McCavity, and, of course, Dame Judi and Sir Ian were terrific. (I definitely noticed that Old Deuteronomy's fur and ensemble bore a most striking resemblance to Queen Elizabeth in Shakespeare in Love, which I'm sure was totally intentional, and I'm reasonably sure I've seen Gus's ""human"" in a similar outfit for a different role as well.) My only real complaint--and it's certainly not her fault--was with Jennifer Hudson's Grizabella having a perpetually runny nose--we know she's supposed to be a wretched outcast, so the teary eyes are quite appropriate, but did she *have* to have a snotty nose throughout? (It made me want to offer the poor cat a tissue for mop-up; Tom Hooper, could you do *something* about that when you inevitably tweak it all again?) The singing and dancing was all on point, even with the actors who weren't from a musical background, with the talking/singing of several performers coming off just fine. (Believe me, I've seen in done in ways that made me cringe--hello, Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady!--but this wasn't one of them.) Yes, I even liked Rebel Wilson, who seems to be getting a lot of grief as Jennyanydots--as a cat person, I've *known* cats just like that, rolling and lolling and lounging and looking totally obscene in the way that only a large, spoiled cat can, and the only reason they don't pick up prey daintily with their fingers is because they literally can't--if they *could*, then they *would*!.

Pretty much everything else: The set design was wonderful--yes, I noticed all the sneaky little cat-related signs and business names, and I'm sure Bast, wherever she may be, is pleased that the theatre was named The Egyptian--and the scale of the set and props re: the performers seemed just about right. I personally didn't happen to notice any serious CGI glitches (there probably were some, but I must have missed them; as for Dame Judy's hand, *all* of the cats had hands rather than paws, so what was the problem with that?), and the lighting fit perfectly, especially that lovely sunrise at the end. Oh, and the musical arrangements were another aspect I'd heard complaints about, but I thought they complimented the songs very well. Oh, what the hell...I even cried during the whole ""Memory"" sequence, and I'm not usually one who cries at movies. *sniff* Finally, the pace moves along quickly and without dragging, and the two hours practically flew by; I daresay there are a number of other films who could use this as an example of what and what not to do in that regard.

TL;DR: I really, really ended up liking the movie, and am seriously inclined to go back to the theatre and see it again, bringing along someone who's heard and only expects the worst, and hopefully converting them, since I do so love to proselytize...won't you come along?

Note: No, I've never seen the stage show, so I was a total CATS virgin; I am, however, someone who's enjoyed musicals their entire life, and has lived with *real* cats for many years, so I like to think I have some understanding of both that I was able to use while writing this review."
8.0,30 December 2019,"Okay. Okay. I'm expecting a lot of just - anger from this, but I liked this movie.

The performances were good, choreography and sets were nice, and personally, I had no problem with the CGI although some of the jumps were odd. This movie did have a plot, and it wasn't hard for me to follow. As a fan of the original musical, I'll definitely say; to anyone saying that this movie is way too good - you should SEE the musical. The musical is definitely better. Anyways. I don't see the problem with this movie, and I thought it was charming and really enjoyable. I didn't enjoy the removal of a certain two characters relationship but other than that- really. It was fine."
9.0,3 January 2020,It´s weird this unanimity against Cats. It´s a musical with men and women dressed like cats! Didn´t you know that? The music is the same as always: wonderful. Good dance and scenery. I spend two pleasant hours at the movie.
10.0,31 December 2019,"After having seen all the negative reviews I was expecting the worst, but really came back pleasantly surprised.

Ok, let's be honest, it wasn't perfect... With actress Rebel Wilson you can expect some slapstick kind of jokes a-la Pitch Perfect, which sometimes feel out of place. I found it hard to adjust to Old Deuteronomy being an old lady instead of the baritone voice. Some of the CGI was not very convincing, but nothing too distracting. Lastly, I could mention that some of the camera shots were a bit static and boring...

Besides that, I think this is a beautiful rendition of the musical Cats, with all the music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in excellent quality, good singing, impressive dancing. Breaking away from the theater stage restrictions allowed for some more freedom in scenery, story-telling and special effects, such as the twitching cat ears and tails.

If you've ever seen the musical this will be a wonderful opportunity to relive the memories, perhaps - like me - wipe a tear during the impressive performance of Memory.... and you're already familiar with the (admittedly) somewhat strange story."
9.0,28 December 2019,"I absolutely loved this film adaptation of cats, I actually don't find any issues with the CGI, yes a cat human hybrid isn't normal but it's also film and I have definitely seen a lot weirder. I actually think it's sad that the CGI is taking away from everything else in this film, I love musical theatre and ballet and thought it was brilliant, the choreography was beautiful and the songs great too. Jennifer Hudson singing memory was unlike anything I've seen or heard before. I also really enjoyed the sets, I found them to be magical."
10.0,23 February 2020,"I am simply baffled by the many negative responses to this film. It's almost as if audiences and critics are competing with each other in being vitriolic. I saw the original stage version in London, which was great, and this film compares very well with that, although I will concede that it gets off to a slow start, but when the big numbers come thick and fast during the second half I was not only touched by some of the performances but genuinely impressed with what these fine actors could achieve despite the heavy make-up. The sensuality of their movements and dancing seemed most convincing, and Mr Mistopheles in particular impressed me. Judy Dench not so much - a rather wooden performance. But if you've never seen Cats please don't take the negativity about this film too seriously. Give it a chance and make up your own mind. I hope you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was."
9.0,13 January 2020,"I went to see this movie because I saw everyone else's awful reviews. And all I have to say is this movie makes no sense and it's horrifying, but that's what makes it good. All 20 of us in the theatre screamed at the screen and cheered and sang along. And all I have to say is this movie gave me the experience of a lifetime and was the perfect tool to scream at"
8.0,15 January 2020,"This movie is bad, yes, but it was also incredible."
10.0,30 January 2020,I was captivated from start to finish. The costuming was uncanny--they were so seamless they didnt look like costumes at all. The choreography was fabulous and very cat-like. The music was exhilerating and brought tears to my eyes. and the casting was spot-on. Jennifer Hudson and Idris Elba blew me away. I saw Cats on Broadway and the movie left the play in the dust. It had to be a movie to be fully appreciated!
9.0,19 April 2020,Only highly intellectual people can appreciate this movie.
9.0,9 February 2020,"I don't get the horrible reviews... The Cats look somewhat weird, but you can get over it after the first 10min. The acting is decent, the set design is beautiful (although the proportions are somewhat off sometimes), the acting is decent, the singing is for the most part more than decent. They added some story line to the stage production's story and I think they did a decent job at that. Even if you do not like the fur technology, I don't think it's reason enough to dismiss the whole thing for just that. Yes, it's not the best movie of the decade, but it is far from the worst. If you're a dreamer and are willing to forgive some shortcomings, do give it a shot!"
9.0,2 January 2020,"I've almost missed this amazing show because of the hail of the negative opinions. These ""Cats"" have an appealing weirdness I can compare to my impression of Alice in Wonderland. I think haters lack either imagination or perception of musical genre. Give this creative work a chance! It's touching and magical. Hudson's performance alone is worth watching."
8.0,25 December 2019,This was a good movie It is not as horrible as some would try to make you believe.
9.0,23 March 2020,"I'm so sick of everyone being a critic nowadays. People that haven't even seen this movie have probably downrated it. That being said I didn't think this movie was 10 stars (more like a 7.5/8) though I gave it 10 to combat all the ridiculous and pointless 1 star reviews.

I think people are forgetting the source material here. I haven't read the book, but I've seen the musical many times, and if you like the musical even a little but, this film is a total delight! Even if your just a crazy cat lover you'll enjoy this film! I decided to rewatch the musical before watching this movie and it had that much more of a positive impact.

This movie was creative, unique, and fun. I loved the fantasy aspect and all the visual treats this movie offered. Give it a chance. It was a lot of fun! Even if you hated the original Cats, there's a chance you may like this film."
10.0,19 January 2020,I went in with an open mind although I almost expected to be disappointed - however I feel that the Rotten Tomatoes reviewers maybe didn't truely understand the principle or creativity behind the musical based on TS Eliots' poetry? (Which is not really a criticism) - I actually very much enjoyed it..... Then again I loved the theatre version - there were slight variations which made it more suited to screen which was necessary. 9/10 from me (because Taylor swift really didn't do justice to her role) - Maybe She should just stick to pop singing? ....... my other fave songs didn't disappoint and I still cried at memory.
8.0,7 January 2020,"I saw it today, and I hardly believe the score. It's much better than that. Yes, it's a highly theatrical movie, based on loosely connected poems about singing and dancing cats, but it's kind of a given, isn't it? I knew what to expect, so I enjoyed it a lot. The cast was great, with some great moments. Ian McKellen did as well as humanly (or catly) possible, his nostalgic charm was deeply touching (okay, he made me tear up, let's get it straight). Francesca Hayward is beautiful, almost dreamlike, the way she looks, the way she moves, the way she smiles, she's just perfect. Every little girls who's socialization was effected by Disney movies wants to grow up to be her (most of them to be grown up finally to be Rebel Wilson rather, and realize only later that it was a luckiest thing ever happened to them, but never mind). Speaking of which, the comic relief section, Rebel Wilson and James Corden were good, they had the most boring songs of them all, and made them work. The character of Macavity was a major letdown from a writer's point of view. In the original he's not a character, just a faceless threat, so he was practically a blank page here, with the potential to be used for anything. Like, for giving the movie a plot, for a start. A sensible one, for those, who don't appreciate T.S. Eliot's poetry enough to keep them entertained for two hours. But his appearance didn't help the plot(lessness) much, because it wasn't connected in any way with Grizabella's storyline, which is, honestly, the only plotline-seed the story has. Not a very strong one, because in the end no one really understands why Old Deuteronomy chooses her. She has this immense pain in her, but humans, not being as empathetic as cats (or maybe it's just me...) prefer a reason to find the decision credible. Seriously, after watching the movie, who on Earth would give her a second chance instead of Gus, or any other contender, when her only regret seems to be that she's not young and pretty anymore? The climax of the story should be the choice itself, and the question to be answered is not why Macavity can't be chosen - it's pretty obvious from a musical's simplistic point of view - but why Grizabella is. It's stated that in the past she went with Macavity, so it was a missed opportunity, I guess it wouldn't be that hard to add a few lines, and, presto, much less one star ratings. Other than this, Jennifer Hudson was good, maybe less close-ups would have worked better though, for some names mentioned make the comparison a bit unflattering for her. And Idris Elba... I don't know, they were able to CGI everyone else into something more or less cat-like, except for him. They kept his original skin tone (which is beautiful btw), without any patterns, which made him look nothing like any cat breed known to date, but still Idris Elba, who grew fur due to some unfortunate medical condition since the last time we saw him. The good news is, if the CGI guys ever plan to make a movie called Yetis, technology is a given. I wonder why no one mentions Robbie Fairchild, who plays Munkustrap. The movie is mostly based on him. He's practically in each and every scene. And he's the only one in the cast who seems to believe, I mean seriously, that he's a cat, and not an actor dressed as a cat. He also has the aura of a leader, which is not easy to convey while meowing, I guess. He did a very convincing job, singing, dancing and acting. Laurie Davidson's Mr. Mistoffelees was cute, I liked the rookie magician concept, but it was a bit overplayed, and the song itself would have worked better with more confidence maybe. Steven McRae, playing Skimbleshanks was simply impeccable. Taylor Swift was more cute than sexy, but given the PG rating it was a knowing choice maybe. The only one I felt a bit out of his depth was Jason Derulo, who simply failed to bring the star quality into his character. His singing was good, but the way he moved looked more self-conscious than badass/over the top, as if he was scared of the space given him to fill. What really made me love the movie was the ending scene. With Judi Dench reciting The Addressing of Cats. If you ever try to break the 4th wall, break it like a boss. With someone of her quality. She made every line sound as if she made them up on the spot, which is, in case of a poem, just incredible. And with arguably the best poem of Old Possum's book (it's just an opinion, obviously, based partly on the fact that it lost some of its edge in translation to my first language, which is always the sign of being a great poem; good ones often can be translated into something equal, or even better, adding a few layers here and there). And I loved the concept so much: a cat, who is also a human, addressing humans about addressing of cats. It was a great meta moment, I really appreciated it."
10.0,17 January 2020,"I had very low expectations when going due to the reviews, but since I'm a musical theatre nerd I wanted to see and judge with my own two eyes. To begin with, I absolutely adore the on-stage musical, and I really enjoyed this film as well. I can see how some people might find the CGI-design a bit strange, but I thought they were very cute to look at. I especially felt my heart melt a little bit every time I saw Mr. Mistoffelees. So cute and adorable. Yes, there are som mistakes in the CGI, like collars not connected to a cat, floating feet etc, but that's basically the only reason I give it a 9/10 and not the full jackpot. It was also pretty... strange when Macavity ""flashed"" in one scene, and then looked naked in another scene (due to his very short fur). Other than that, the film really captures the musical, and I LOVED that they added in Victorias storyline, since it gave the film a bit more structure than the original show (the show can be a bit confusing). And that they gave Mr. Mistoffelees a bit more storyline as well, since he's (obviously) my favourite cat (was in the musical as well). So don't listen so much to the negative reviews, go and see what YOU think!"
10.0,31 December 2019,I love cats. And I love movies! And I love dogs! But that's beside the point. The movie was amazing!! I love it!!!
4.73,3 January 2020,"From a guy who likes ""Curly Sue"" and "" Mirror Mask"" but also likes ""Inception"" ""Shutter Island"" and ""Saw"" as well.

Like I said on my review of ""Curly Sue"" I did years ago,we need a bit of silly, nae,,, even stupid, and whimsy.

Would you rather watch another movie about Vampires, or the Fastest fury, or whatever, many times, me too.

I'm glad a stupid, silly singing cat show brought a slight tear to my eye, and healing to my heart.

It's kinda like a mild, PG, hallucinogenic high, mixes with film, about a book of poems, about cats, introducing themselves to a new possible member.

The director, and screen writer actually took some necessary creative direction to the writer, T. S. Elliot's short book. A very cute, and important piece of literature, But it is a kids book, Intellectual Londonite children book from 1939.

P.S. The rating is weird, about 1/5th of people really liked it, but it stays flat until it hits the 1 spot. Most 2.something movies have very low 7 thru 10, generally only 8 out of 10 lie a movie with this low a rating. It's all singin n dancin, so come on...."
4.73,27 January 2020,"Political assasination of The Wonderful ?

Some halfwit reviewer claimed this as not as good as The Broadway theatrical great. Excuse me ?!! I think you'll find it started as a British West End theatre triumph. So does it all come down to "" lets hate the Brits"" cause we can't claim it as American. Are the Bafta awards becoming such a threat to the Oscars?!!

All of the creative talents in this film positively shine. I don't really like Rebel Wilson ......but she aced this. I don't really laugh at James Corden....but he aced this too. Mostly amusing with occasionally funny. I wanted to hate Jennifer Hudsons version of Elaine Paiges classic ""memories"". Boy, was I impressed. I know the choreography was not Gillian Lynnes perfection, but Francesca Haywards magnificence is undeniable. I loved the musicianship..............so not the assault on the ears that the 1998 film did so badly. And overarching all are the creative genii that are Dame Judi and Sir Ian Its libelous and slanderous to claim otherwise.

Think for yourself when you judge this film, not like 'The Emperors New Clothes' trolls. See it for what it really is."
4.73,22 March 2020,I am not surprised that this did not appeal to the masses and I am glad that it did not; in order to do so it would have had not honored the stage production. My only complaint is that a few of the songs especially Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer were changed so much. You certainly do not have to be intelligent to appreciate this movie nor does hating imply stupidity but it is interesting that the brains that do not appreciate it do not have a grasp of the 1-10 rating system which is making IMDB irrelevant.
4.73,2 February 2020,"I'm cat person with 3 cats, and I've seen the live musical.

The cgi, dancing & acting is impressive...

The fur, the twitchy tails, the subtle way the ears rotate, the elegant cat-like dancing, the cat-like facial expressions, the variations in coat patterns... attention to detail & cat behavior was amazing & so true to real cats.

Maybe this movie was not so true to the live version, but it was an adorable human tribute to cats - to their beauty, their struggles & joys!

I thought the movie was just as good as the live musical, (I've never been crazy about the songs though) Other than that... really cute & entertaining! Loved it!"
4.73,21 March 2020,"Mooie film.

Grote musical fan. Grote van van de originele Cats (1998)."
4.73,10 February 2020,Only normies don't get that its meanings are much deeper than normal. It loses two points because the execution of singing was lackluster and the Grizabella casting was horrible (not because she's forget racists but because she was way too young and uninteresting for that regal role).
4.73,2 January 2020,"I just don't understand the negative reviews. Great dancing and music, and I really don't mind if some of them can't sing that well. Daft comments about lack of plot (it's simple enough) and scary appearances are hard to fathom. Just go and enjoy it."
4.73,4 January 2020,"Horrible green screen graphics (which honestly added to the enjoyability of this film) aside, this was a very well choreographed and amazingly performed musical. Despite not seeing Cats the musical, I had no trouble following the plot. All of the actors did their parts respectably and I was invested the whole time."
4.73,23 December 2019,I just love the fact that every second was singing and that the movie only had a few minutes of an actual plot. if I could go above ten stars I would put an infinite amount. my friends and I loved it so much they started to die from how good it was. and with a budget of 95 MILLION dollars I think they did really good.
4.73,28 December 2019,"I think this film is a classic example of expectations being too high. It was never going to be a word for word step for step remake of the stage show and why should it be. Whilst Lloyd Webber created an amazing show it would be stupid to replicate it. Whilst the stage show has only singing, this movie goes deeper into creating a story so the dialogue is very helpful to helping the story along.

Use your imagination and some of the fantastic imagery and within it is actual a diamond in the rough.

The choreography is not as sharp as the 1998 production however when watching it you have to remember that they are trying to replicate feline movement - something which they actually do quite well!

I adore the stage musical and think the music within it is fantastic. The cast do a wonderful job of carrying the story and bringing more attention to Victoria and WHY the cats are doing what they are doing that the stage musical does. They have given the cats more personality which is deeply needed.

The only weakness in the cast is Taylor Swift who sadly doesn't seem to realise she should be moving like a cat not as a pop star -

That being said Judi Dench is a fantastic Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen is an adorable Gus!!

Overall it isn't to everyone's taste but as a firm fan of the stage musical I very much approve of the vision of this film. Some parts of it don't fit and don't look as sharp as they could but if you go in with no expectations and let your imagination guide you I guarantee you'll enjoy it far more than trying to compare it or make it something it just isn't."
4.73,23 December 2019,I loved this movie! I highly recommend any musical lovers to c this movie.
4.73,1 January 2020,"I have never been lucky enough to see the live broadway production. But I know the songs and I'm fairly cultured. I really enjoyed this film and admired the clever ways they did things and interpreted things into a cinema format. The singing was beautiful and casting brilliant. I think all the negative reviews are either by those who are theater snobs or those who had no clue what they were going to watch and what it was supposed to be. Was it amazing no. Was it great yes! Very enjoyable, attention capturing and entertaining."
4.73,24 December 2019,"I really don't understand all the negative commentary on this movie. It's entertaining to watch with a dose of good humor and captivating performances by Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, Judi Dench and Jason Derulo. I especially loved the ending (no spoilers here though).

To all who hate this movie: tame those feral Cats."
4.73,29 December 2019,Guess it's gonna be like Marmite. The kids loved it.
4.73,1 January 2020,"This is a beautiful production of one of the most successful musicals ever. Addition of some dialogue and one or two songs provides a clearer plot line than the original, but a traditional story is not the purpose of this production. This is NOT ""The Aristocats"". There have been complaints about incomplete superimposing of fur CGI, but I believe this produces a separation that lets us see cats as both surreal and mystical, and also not so different to us. Immerse yourself in this world, and you will laugh, cry, and cheer.

Exceptional actors and performers bring a superb level of dance, performance, and song. In addition to icons like Judy Dench and Ian McKellen, and the vocal talents of Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift, there are multiple ""triple threats"" from musical theatre that movie audiences may not be as familiar with, notably Steven McRae as Skimbleshanks, Robbie Fairchild as Munkustrap, and of course James Corden as Bustopher Jones. And I can't close without mentioning the gorgeous performance by Francesca Hayward as Victoria, who ties the story together and channels the beauty and sensuality of ""cat"" like nothing I have ever seen."
4.73,16 February 2020,"Honestly cats is awesome. Saw it in a rowdy screening where you could sing, dance, hiss and act like a cat. It was great. The story makes zero sense but the songs are fun and the dancing is fun and the idea of two legged cats are fun and all the cat characters are fun. People have really bad taste and adverse reactions to fun and silliness. Hissssssss to the general public. Meooowwww to Cats!"
4.73,8 January 2020,"I enjoyed this production of Cats. So many talented people and wonderful performances. Taylor Swift was wonderful. I thought Jennifer Hudson was also great, but I would love to hear her sing and un-acted version of Memory. They way she sang it fit perfectly with the story, and of course she hit the dramatic part second to none, but still...and I always wished that song was longer. I think the movie should get an award for costumes, except why in the world did they neuter everyone? If you like musical ones, this is a good one"
4.73,4 February 2020,"I've just spent a productive two hours watching the late 2019 movie ""Cats"". Now I had read the critics panning it, saying they weren't real cats, and the story was weird.

Clearly they hadn't seen the live show, something I've seen many times from the original Sydney production at the Theatre Royal (where I spied British comedian Mel Smith in the audience) to Gosford Musical Society's to the UK video with Elaine Page and in the Big Top at St Ives showground, among others, amateur and professional.

I still know the lyrics pretty well, and was pleased that singing along - apart from a couple of sections (see below) was an easily achieved joy.

There were a few minor insertions of dialogue in between songs, which provided a bit more character exposition than what you get in the musical. They weren't obtrusive, and quite helpful.

*MOST* of the production is faithful to the musical, except many previous third person descriptions of a character sung by other cats now see those lines given directly to the character.

They changed the melodic structure of ""Mungo Jerry & Rumpleteazer"" for the worst, but made a few cuts here and there for the better.

There was a delightful addition of a song following ""Memory"" (first rendition) sung by a soprano which was completely new material for the movie.

In some places the lyrics are obviously drawn from parts of the original T S Eliot that Webber didn't use in the musical, but this only happened in a couple of places.

The sets apparently used modern CGI, and naturally much greater visuals than ever possible in a theatre. The look of the production is slick, and wardrobe and make-up are a real tour-de-force.

It's also a little bit darker with cats, especially Macavity, pushing their case to be reborn for a new jellicle life, and Old Deuteronomy's responses, something not in the musical.

With Judy Dench as Old Deuteronomy we miss the dulcet baritones of this role, but she plays the dramatic side impeccably which adds to the understanding of the story. Ian McKellen was Bustopher Jones, and did his song exceptionally well for an old salt.

There are certainly differences, but they are mainly related to transferring a live show successfully into a movie. If you've seen the musical you'll love it. The familiar ""Cats"" is all there. If you haven't, then you'll either ""get it"" and love it too, or miss the point, as a number of the aforementioned critics obviously did.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's score and Eliot's lyrics have always combined beautifully. Webber's highly syncopated arrangements appeal to all listeners of many genres.

This is what ensures any production of this highly original concept will border on masterpiece levels.

I absolutely loved it."
4.73,25 December 2019,"I'm convinced the poor reviews are left by those who lack a profound appreciation for the arts, the weird, the offbeat, the whimsical imagination. What a treat for the senses and the soul. I was absolutely engrossed from beginning to end."
4.73,26 December 2019,".Dear Diary, Today I saw the movie ""Cats"". It has been destroyed mercilessly by the critics. Indeed so much so that I HAD to see it even more to see how badly Hollywood had destroyed one of my all time favourite musicals with its CGI realistic fur covered actors. Contrary to popular belief they are real actors in this film. Real singing, real dancing and real situations and emotions...only the fur is fake. Its quite PC in that way if you like. They only touched up the bodies with Computer generated costuming. OK so the missed a few bits. Yes the version I saw today still had the human hands and Dame Judy Dench does have a lovely ring but why pan that as a movie fault. They have human faces, human eyes, lips, feet so what difference does a hand make? That is just nit picking in the extreme. I have no problem with it. From the opening bars in the darkened theatre of almost 10 people... I cried. Tears rolled down my face with the beauty of those simple notes. I LOVE Cats the musical. It's on my ipod, its one of my 10 desert Island albums. I LOVED (almost) every part of this movie. I knew every song word for word. I knew the history of each cat and their personal pains and I love how each on was brought to life by the various actors portraying them today. I had my doubts about Political correctness. Dame Judy as Old Deuteronomy, was originally a male role. But surprisingly it translated well. She was magnificent. Just one look in her eyes as she stares a Grisibella...and I was weeping again. I was pretty much crying at the beauty of this film for two hours. Even Rebel Wilson has a new respect from me. She played Jennyenydot to perfection. Although there was an additional sub plot in the film and she was an integral part of it, her quips, one liners and costumes changes were exactly right for her expanded role and personality. If I have one major criticism its with Macavity the Mystery Cat played magnificently by Idris Elba and its simply that although beautifully rendered with a solid muscular body and the blackest fur with deep green eyes... the lyrics say quite clearly.. Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in

Macaviy here is simply NOT a black cat. Even in the movie they use the lyric ""Ginger Cat"" but show a fine but scary looking black cat. They really could have keep Idris in the role as he is perfect but CGI'ing ginger fur on the Avatar, Its not rocket science, However this is my only criticism.

I loved this movie. I have already bought a ticket to see it again. I will own it n DVD when possible. I will turn up at midnight screenings in a onsie if necessary. Drag Queens are going to love the new song Taylor Swift added to the sound track ""Beautiful Ghosts"" It... just... works.

The story is about learning about our cats and thus learning about ourselves. Its about magic and mischief and forgiveness. Its about beauty being more than fur deep. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry because you know what is coming and its wonderful. Ok, it has a sub plot but its more of a expansion of the characters and is entirely feasible script wise..

See it... Take a new eyeliner and tissues. But see it..That means you"
4.73,3 January 2020,"I like musicals. I've never seen Cats , until this evening when I took my wife and two adult daughters to see it. All we knew was the song Memories.

I liked it. It was funny, moving and weird.

Francesca Hayward's singing and dancing was beautiful. I loved all the balletic dance. Taylor Swift can sing without an autotune and actually has a nice voice. She contributed the lyrics to one song, and it added poignancy, if any were needed, to Memories.

Idris Elba - I always thought he was a nice guy, but his performance as Macavity leads me to a rethink (joke). He can sing, he can move, and he can be creepy.

For all the other actors - know and not so well known - it was clear that they were chosen for the best to play that role.

At the time of writing, the film has an overall rating of 2.8. I suspect over the years it will gain a following. It's no Les Miserables, but it is a good film."
4.73,8 October 2022,People give this such a hard time but I personally liked it the music was awesome the dancing was awesome the story line was great people need to stop judging things before the even watch it it's so stupid. I love all the music especially Mcavity was my favorite and they put a lot of famous actors in this which I thought was great. They took along time to do this movie so people need to appreciate it again James corden was so funny he always is in his movies he always does an awesome job in his movies . The dancing was not what I expected it was top notch it must have taken so long to practice it.
4.73,19 January 2020,I recommend 100% this film for all the dreamers...
4.73,3 November 2023,"Plot no, character interest no, drama almos no. So wats left; great song and dance. Sweet costumes. Maybr under fills feature length, but mezmerizing got done, like the author of thes. That central song embeds itself somewhere deep in brain tissue for some; wishes condense to just. Desire for another repetition.of that brilliant Andrew Lloyd Webber melody and haunting T. S Eliot words..Barbra Streisand later embedded it furthers, but this earlier version still compels.

Memory, all alone in the moonlight I can dream of the old days Life was beautiful then I remember the time I knew what happiness was Let the memory live again."
4.73,23 December 2019,"I admit, when I first saw the trailer I thought it looked a little different and I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it but I am so glad that I did. The original songs and the singing is amazing. There are so many big artists included which I love because I am a huge fan girl. Taylor Swift is in it and I absolutely love her. I do wish that she got more screen time but a movie wouldn't put her in it just for a promotional tool. I know Taylor and she wouldn't agree to do the movie if that was the case. Not everyone has huge amounts of screen time in any more. I highly suggest it."

4.73,28 December 2019,"Caveat emptor ... i'm a cat person AND a dog person.

I loved the original Cats (1998), have the VCD, watched many times. I also watched the live theatrical version twice.

I loved this version, a total remake. Of course most people would know the story and its ending. + The makeup was wonderful, so realistic compared to previous version. + The street scenes and indoor scenes with larger than life furniture was great, and attempts to scale to proportion what cats would see and do. + The actors and actresses mimic the action of the cats. + Victoria (white cat) was very good at singing and dancing. + Grizabella's singing was absolutely stunning ! If that's really Jennifer Hudson singing, then kudos !!!"
4.73,24 September 2021,"Im not going to lie, i only watched this for taylor. She didnt disappoint, but of course she never does."
4.73,2 January 2020,"Look, I have to admit that I haven't even seen this movie, nor will I (I actually walked out of the stage show.) So WHY am I giving it 9 stars?? Well, I'm hoping that people will now admit that the movie version of Les Miz was also truly terrible, and a complete insult to the fabulous stage show. If the Cats movie achieves this, then I'm happy to give it 9 stars 😀"
4.73,31 March 2020,"Very good movie! Music, ballet, songs, nostalgia and not creepiness!"
4.73,28 December 2019,"I personally thought the movie was good , it was not as bad as what the reviews were Saying in my opinion ! Really enjoyed the movie . The singing and dancing was very good ! I would recommend this film ."
4.73,3 July 2022,
4.73,20 April 2020,I loved how they gave such a different story line. There is so much imagination to this. The music was beautiful and so what about cgi. This was so true. And beautiful.
4.73,29 December 2019,This is cinema. Isn't b'way show. Different. A eccellent film
4.73,20 April 2023,"I absolutely love this film!!

As a long-time enjoyer of the musical (I performed this in my amateur theatre troupe and I played Mr. Mistoffelees!), I greatly enjoyed the inspirational portrayal of the characters. I feel that Tom Hooper did a fantastic job of truly reviving the classic characters and evoking their true dimensions.

Essentially, this is a film about love, betrayal, passion, eroticism, and this modern world we live in. It truly goes against cancel culture of the Gen Z snowflakes and stakes its own place in the cinematic cannon - in fact, the cinematic annals of history.

This is better than any of Hooper's previous works. I went to see it with my late mother and it was the last film she saw before she passed. I am incredibly grateful that this masterpiece was her final viewing experience (she was a massive Taylor Swift fan so it was a bonus! She loved Bombalurina and her song).

Overall, please ignore the haters of Cats. James Cordon and Dame Judi Dench made up one of the most memorable casts of all time with their acting prowess.

The only thing that could have improved this film is if it was longer!"
4.73,8 January 2020,New reincarnation of famous musical. For those who loves creativity of A.L.Webber
4.73,3 January 2024,"When I saw the movie during the holiday break of 2019, I knew the movie is a masterpiece, everyone love the songs and love the plot, it was a great film based on the Broadway musical. Steven Spielberg is a genius on this, his magic touch has done it again. The movie is also nominated for a golden globe for best original song because of this. My aunt and I love the movie, my older sister (who is a Broadway fanatic) might recommend seeing it. But many people on the internet disagree it, I was the odd one out of this. And this is not an uncanny valley, this is a breaktaking expierence. Cats has been a Broadway favorite that fans of the stage musical might recommend seeing it, not internet bloggers."
4.73,18 October 2020,"Plotless but not pointless. The characters arch, the music soars, and I was somehow spell-bound by those little jellicle felines."
4.73,22 February 2022,"If you want movie, then this... is cat movie for cats. Is also made by cat? I think, who knew a cat could look so much like Jimmy Fallon, i mean Corden, ruddy unbelievable."
4.73,26 October 2021,"Making this as a movie was what made so many people hate this movie as this movie is mostly for CATSthe musical fans

i think making this as a movie made a lot of younger people warch it that dont love / fans / care of the 1980's musical

if iy was a YT special only the fans would watch it and it would get very good reviews

i thought this was was an amazing movie but im a sucker for the original musical also

i think it wasnt smart.to releae this as movie on theaters rather then a special somewhere."
4.73,14 December 2022,"An endeering rendition of Cats. Moving and highly entertaining. The ""cats"" are iconic symbols of human behaviour in catty characters. Exactly as Eliot meant, i think. The plot, if ever there is one, is about atonement and redemption, about loss and gain, about friendship and acceptance. This is beautifully met in the different human characters in feline form. The music is entertaining and clever constructed, e.g. In the imitation fragment of the jellicle dance. Not directly ""singalong"" music, but that is just the point. The dancing i find smooth and fine. Other commentators who defy this dancing being ""not catlike"" or ""unreal"" should reconsider their opinions. Who ever thought this should be about cats is sorely mistaken. This is a movie about us. That is why its so appealing. This is no opera in which the singing should always be pitch perfect. Reading all the negative reviews here stem from viewers who obviously fail to understand the movie. I think its very good."
4.73,16 April 2020,"I am not a movie or musical person whatsoever, but I have got to say it is actually, no word of a lie, one of the greatest things I have ever experienced.

The movie is a garish, over the top spectacle, and I would not have it any other way. The dancing and singing is on point. The scenery is perfect. The ears and tails move with the mood of each character just like they would with a real cat.

I honestly had no idea what to expect, and I was quite blown away. The music matches with the story, and that is my thing, especially with concept albums outside of film.

Do not listen to the universal panning, it demands much better. The smaller name performers are what make this movie special. Give them the recognition they derseve.

Watch it. Love it or hate it. Sing to it.

I will die on this newly made hill of CGI feline madness with glee."
4.73,16 October 2021,"It was and still is extremely popular for people to hate, nay, despise this movie. Almost everyone who has heard of the movie and some who have actually seen it will tell you it is the worst thing ever created. They'll tell you about the look of the cats, the lack of a story. And even the terrible songs are the reasons they hate it so much. I guess I'm gonna have to go against the grain on this one because I enjoyed seeing it, heck, I've seen it three times. Maybe it's my bizarre taste in movies (for pete's sake, I love some of the weirdest films around, 'Coneheads, anyone?'), but I actually got absorbed in the songs and the world created. All of those towering sets dwarfing the human actors, the strange yet captivating mocap work on the performers, the dance work and choreography, and the songs.... the cast is uniformly strong and I think Hooper's direction here is even better than his work on Les Mis."
4.73,4 January 2020,"I had to come on here to try to read about what's going on? I'm sitting in the theater watching the movie. I'm not sure what's going on. I've never seen Cats before, so I'm not sure what it's about... I brought my 8 year old children. They wanted to see it. lol It's ok, but I just don't know the story. So far they're ok with it. lol We has one bathroom run which I totally welcomed!"

4.73,25 April 2020,"The experience is quite strange when I watched Cats (this version). Some scenes may be accepted on stage, but in movie theatres, the fantastic scenes become horrible."
4.73,3 November 2020,"If this would of been my first musical experience,it would of been a short one. Disgrace to an iconic hit,or any musical in general. For the huge cast,many decent actors & singers it was poorly done. It's hard to find appreciation,even with costumes. Skip it! Watch anything else. Too bad was excited,when it was originally announced."
4.73,6 February 2020,
4.73,6 May 2020,It was beautiful but it needed a Narrator or something to allow us to get to know each character and the whole purpose. I think that would have solved the issue. If could have worked also if the cats spoke more.. this helps the audience to understand if they have never see the musical.
4.73,16 September 2020,This would be the world if Democrats and Labour were in charge. You would be forced to watch this on repeat every day.
4.73,23 January 2020,"If you've been following so far you'd probably come to the conclusion, all on your lonesome, that I don't like to twist the handle once I have plunged in the blade. I mean, there's no point, right? You say the movie sucks, I say the movie is bad, we agree to disagree and move on. But when it comes to Cats, it's a different story. The movie breaks all norms and has a daring edge rarely seen on similar productions. I mean, you have to admit this much about a movie where Taylor Swift is dressed in a tight fur costume and laying her elongated body in an open invitation. Never mind what that invitation is for. She could be asking you to pass the salt for all one cares. But let's leave young and feisty Swift for a while and focus on the rest of the cast. I had it from reliable sources that Idris Elba is in the movie and Dame Judi Dench as well. Now, I have something to say about that, but again I'll keep it to myself because this is not the place for it and I don't like to cast the first stone. So let's at least keep it civil, OK? Now about the script. There's a whole lot to be said about that script. But again I'm not going to say it. No, siree bob. Let's just leave it at that. The acting in itself was what you'd expect it to be from such a cast. Except in this case the cast was not really themselves so maybe you shouldn't go see the movie with high expectations. Better yet, maybe you shouldn't go see the movie, period. I see that I did venture an opinion there. that wasn't intentional, I assure you. As for the director, well, the least said about that the better. We all know how cats are prone to mood swings. It must have been hard trying to direct a cast of cats clawing at each other all the time. So I kind of feel bad for the guy. I realize I haven't said a nice word about this movie so far. Well, I'm not going to start now. But maybe if I ever watch it someday, I might find some redeeming quality to mention or even a fleeting moment of brilliance or something. You never know with these movies, right?"
