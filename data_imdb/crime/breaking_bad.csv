10.0,4 July 2021,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."

10.0,30 July 2021,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
10.0,19 February 2020,"I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.

10.0,9 November 2021,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"

10.0,9 December 2022,Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!
10.0,13 November 2017,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.

Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
7.0,6 August 2022,"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.

Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long."
5.0,12 February 2014,"This is a hard show to review. The first few seasons were incredible but I feel that they dragged it out too long. As the weeks go by I found myself thinking ""really, there are 5 seasons of this"". I am truly diverse in my tastes and don't get offended very easily at all. I love gore, gritty, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, romance, animation. You get the picture I really do not discriminate and instead judge on it's merits. But I found that Breaking Bad exhausted me. Five seasons of disgusting, corruption, ferralness, deplorable human behaviour took it's toll on my level of appreciation for this show. If it had been shorter I would have enjoyed it more. I know it was revolutionary and truly realistic but in the end I despised it for being great and the fact that I had to see it through to the end.

I know people will think I am mad for writing this but does a show that is fantastic but sucks the soul and heart out of you make for as good TV as everyone believes; or was everyone else too caught up in the hype to admit their true feelings about Breaking Bad."
10.0,19 May 2014,"People are STILL talking about Breaking Bad, long after the series finale, and I just wanted to write a bad review partly out of spite, but mostly out of confusion. I'm confused by the seemingly universal love for this show...

I'm a big film/television fan, and I love large-scale, epic drama more than my own mother, but Breaking Bad just never really did it for me. I have watched every episode of Game of Thrones at least 4 times, and I could watch them again without nodding off once, but I struggled to make it through a season of BB spread out over the course of a month. It became a chore to watch it, like it was obligatory.

I will give credit where it's due, and say that Bryan Cranston gave a phenomenal performance.

That being said, outstanding performances are in no short supply in television these days, and they can be found in series that are - wait for it - more original. Yes, this series is praised for its originality, but the ""middle class parent turned drug dealer"" bit has been done before. Granted, not to the scale of BB, but the premise IS unoriginal."
10.0,9 December 2022,"I have never watched any series which depicts emotions so exactly through camera angles, dialogues, screen play, perfect story line other than ""Breaking Bad"". We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this. Teaches us loyalty, family love, pain and many more things.

More than anything this series teaches people to live life the different way and changes people mindset towarss life.

There are scenes which will stay with you forever after this series and it will change the way you watch TV Series and life for that matter.

I don't think I will ever see any series which will be better than this.

Perfection!"
10.0,12 January 2014,"If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.

The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).

For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
10.0,9 November 2021,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
10.0,12 August 2021,"Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.

I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time."
10.0,20 May 2019,"I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.

Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.

Thank you for existing.

10.0,15 February 2021,"If i say that it was good , but not excellent , every fan will try to kill me , but it's my opinion"
10.0,14 December 2017,"It's already famous, to me this is an average TV show. Lack of suspension & excitement, terrible Spanish, non realistic character development and horrible ending. They extend a short story by adding lots of camera details and spinning the story. For DEA character, how can be any DEA agent that much dumb?

It's more like a family TV show, lots of emotional scenes."
10.0,13 March 2008,"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week!

10/10

Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!"
10.0,6 December 2022,This show was easily a cinematic masterpiece its the best show I watched. From the cinematography to the songs used it's the best. It starts slow but if you give it a chance it speeds up and gets more action-packed. Almost every episode is good. One episode 3x10 is pretty slow but almost every episode is great and it is easily one of the best shows of all time beside better call Saul. I highly suggest watching this show and the rest of the breaking bad universe. I recommend watching the breaking bad universe in this order: 1. Breaking Bad 2. El Camino (Movie) 3. Better call Saul This order is the best for the storyline of the breaking bad universe and if you watch this show you will easily love it. Everything about the show is perfect all the actors are less well known and Aaron Paul had no prior acting experience but still played one of the important characters of the show and he even hung out with drug addicts to have real experience and to act his role perfectly.

10.0,3 March 2023,"This serie is unique. This is somehow realistic and amazing also. Even if you're going to watch for find the flaws, I bet you can't find real major flaws in this serie. You know some people are just tries to find nonsense things in contents. (I mean in a movie or TV show) They are hard to pleased but even those people can enjoy this serie, because they really can't find one easily.

I don't know how Vince Gilligan think this serie. It is real complicated and amazing story. He's a true genius that deserves so much more. He shared the golden age of TV Shows with Game of Thrones. It is best crime, drama TV series possible. And it ended with the best way possible.

The actings are quite remarkable. I don't know how we were'nt know the name Bryan Cranston, I don't know how he didn't became a big star before this show. Giancarlo Esposito, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn Jonathan Bakns and Bob Odenkirk is also pretty amazing. Nearly all cast did a perfect job.

Cinematography is so good in this serie. Not only looks great but also brings realistic style with that shaking camera sequences. You feel the moment with silence.

Costume Design is also underrated. Did you know that characters has his own colors that reflects his personality? I know, it isn't a secret, many people know that but it really is something great.

Also makeups are pretty good, did you know Bryan Cranston had hair when he's bald? Yes there was hair behind that. I know it's not that hard thing to do, It's not magic. But also wounded characters are too realistic. Especially Jesse's wounded face."
10.0,27 June 2017,"Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: ""No thank you"" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see ""Breaking Bad"" again. I can't wait."
7.0,6 December 2022,"I binged breaking bad, worst mistake of my life, never binge a good show! Especially not breaking bad, binge it when rewatching, same experience. You can binge something multiple times, but you can only experience the show once. Anyways, on to the review.

What hasn't been said about breaking bad? It's an absolute masterpiece that pretty much everyone has watched. It starts off with an insignificant highschool chemistry teacher and ends with a ruthless drug lord (hopefully not spoiling too much here). But this is not only the story of a broken man, what many (I think many people anyway) fail to acknowledge is the team that worked on breaking bad, the progression of the writing. The first season is a pretty good crime drama about a chemistry teacher breaking bad, nothing special. However, when you get to the last season, every goddamn frame is a breathtaking painting.

If you're putting off watching this: I'm not going to urge you to watch it. Take your time, but still do watch it obviously.

Breaking bad is what art is meant to be, a birth and a death. It was made with passion, not an endless money grab like the sitcom. I know it's been said over and over, but death is what makes birth meaningful and beautiful. Season 1 was good, but you need to watch the finale to fully appreciate the beginning. Breaking bad is the story of a man, but do not mistake it for a tragedy. It is simply the legacy of a prideful man. We all want our stories heard, we all want to live on in others, we are all desperately human. I simply ask you to keep the story of breaking bad going, watch the show and be grateful for Vince Gillian's creativity."
5.0,8 December 2022,"Spoiler free review of this and i am utterly shocked by how good this show was. Season 1 started off slow so dont drop the show so quickly, this show becomes one of the greatest shows of all time and my favourite show.

It really dives deep into Walter Whites character and his development throughout the show. He starts off as a boring high school Chemistry Teacher with cancer to a Drug Lord Millionaire. Another great part about this show is its Cinematography the shots and camera angles placed by Vince Gilligan are gorgeous and beautiful. And dont get me started on the acting, the acting for this show is absolutely amazing and gut wrenching. To Parents: DO NOT WORRY, This show isn't bad for children who are 13+ however, make sure that your child is VERY mature going into this show. Most of the sexuality is in season 1 and is almost completely gone by season 3-5 in fact, Season 5 has no sexuality, The Gore however is quite frequent and sometimes graphic Mostly in season 1 and 4 with Season 4 Eps 1 being the most brutal eps in the show but you can just close your eyes if you cant watch it. Season 5 is the most saddest season and has loads of intense scenes. This show might be a little Mature for the younger audience but it tells a magnificent story and you should definitely give it a go."
10.0,23 April 2020,"Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable. Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show."
10.0,29 September 2024,"In 29/9 and same time this Date is Final Episode Day ( Filena ) This is The Best Tv Show I have ever had season one a little slow like season two and season three but seasons four, Season Five Was Perfect Very Good Character have in this TV Show Like Walter White, Giancarlo Esposito, Mike, Hank And Jesse I Love All Of Them What'a Story Breaking Bad in My Heart And Stay in My Brain Forever I Will Miss This Tv Show Coming Soon But The Good Point is I'm not saw Better Call Saul Next Up is Better Call Saul I'm Happy to See The Best TV Show Ever This Date For My Is Very Special 29 9 2024 At 5:30AM I Awake To Watch Filena Final Episode Thank You Breaking Bad I Love You."
10.0,1 July 2015,
10.0,11 October 2022,"Where do I even begin? The writing is near perfect, the actors and characters are all amazing, the over-arching story just gets only better and better. This show is just a bullet train, this just goes and refuses to stop. It pulls no punches, everything that happens has all the impact. And honestly, there isn't a single bad episode. Every episode, yes even ""Fly"", serves a purpose, and honestly, shouldn't be skipped over upon first viewing. And for a show that ended in 2013, it's still relatively popular and beloved among people. Everyone I know still loves the show and loves it to death.

There isn't much else to say, other than that this show is perfect. 10/10."
9.0,26 February 2009,"BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite ""Must See"", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.

10.0,11 March 2009,"I have to echo another reviewer on here and say that as of the past many years I have not watched television, save PBS, Discovery, or History channel. And the news, of course. There has been nothing except The Sopranos and Family Guy in the realm of series that warranted my attention. Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings.

But Now !! Now we have Breaking Bad !!!

All I can say is: HOLY S**T !!! This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!!"
10.0,7 December 2020,
10.0,21 January 2008,"The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.

For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, ""living realistically as a middle class in the United States"" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like ""Bad."" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.

Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he ""never smoked."" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.

He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.

For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea."
6.0,9 August 2021,"Everything from the subtle details, to the unmatched writing and the perfect cast, to the very beautifully shot scenes. It may very well be the best Tv-show out there. The story, even with some creative liberties, is well grounded, believable and feels very real. The show, unlike others, ages like fine wine. The more you watch and the longer you sink in the better it gets. I can think of few series which grow stronger and better every season. It's not only worth sinking your teeth into, it's worth eating. Breaking Bad is a timeless piece and it will stand even long into the future, and will forever be one of the best Tv-shows to ever come out."
5.0,21 February 2020,"The best series I have seen in my whole life, even better than the wire."
10.0,30 December 2023,"This is the rudest and best TV series I've watched. And he is rude not in terms of cruelty (although there is also enough of it here), but in terms of narration, this story itself is already terrifying, especially when after watching you review season 1 and remember how you thought that everything was already bad here...

Walter White is objectively one of the most charismatic and well-researched characters in the history of cinema, Gustavo Fring, who appeared in the future, is one of the most memorable antagonists, and so on. You can write something about each character, but the point is the same - they are all worked out as much as possible and it will be interesting for you to observe the development of their character throughout the seasons.

Regarding the seasons, this series is one of the few examples where the further the better, and not the other way around. 62 episodes are not repulsive, on the contrary - when they end, it will be sad.

In the development of the story, we will see Walt's alter ego ""Heisenberg"" becoming more and more open.

I think the end of the series is brilliant and, if not the best, then one of the best in history, everything is so worked out...

I don't think it's worth describing anything else. This show is on the 1st place in the top and therefore you just have to watch and enjoy its greatness."
10.0,21 March 2021,"Pros: well cast, great acting and mostly highly entertaining. Lots of interesting characters, fun moments and once in a while: great action. Cons: To keep the drama rolling, the writers want us to accept characters that act like morons on a regular basis, and perpetually make decisions that make little to no sense on any level. It's not only infuriating but very quickly gets tedious. The two main characters seem to be hellbent on sabotaging themselves for no other reason than moving the story forward. It's annoying, mostly because it should be unnecessary if you have competent writers. Entertaining escapism for sure. Deserving a 9.5+ score? Sorry, no."
10.0,25 March 2020,"The caveat here is that I only made it through 1 season and a couple episodes of season 2 then had to quit. I really tried to like this show but my god is it boring. I've heard the show gets really good in the later seasons but you shouldn't have to watch 10-15 hours to ""get to the good stuff"". I honestly don't get it. Aaron Paul is a horrible actor too, it's honestly cringeworthy. Someone please tell me what I'm missing. Oh one more thing- I don't want to see Bryan Cranston force himself onto his wife anymore, I almost puked"
10.0,19 March 2021,"To be honest I liked only the last season. The plot is so obvious. I also don't like the characters, Walter's evolution is incredible but the character is so hateful!! Jesse is so stupid and Skyler is annoyng."
10.0,6 January 2024,"Being able to finish the entire show in a week and a half is a testament to how tightly written, engaging and easily binge-able it is. Some of the most fascinating character studies you'll ever see. You can't help but get invested in the different characters' journeys and the overarching story. The storytelling is impeccable and the dialogue between characters is dynamic and engaging. At times, very intense and other times funny. The acting is some of the best you'll ever see. There's a reason why so many of the actors either won or were nominated for awards. The cinematography is poetic. An iconic and unforgettable show. Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best, if not, the best show of all time. An unstoppable, immovable force of cinema that demands to be watched, and maybe even re watched. If you've never watched Breaking Bad, do yourself a favor. Climb out from under the rock you've been living under and give this show a watch. Believe me, you won't regret it.

There's moments in this show that are truly unforgettable, that stick with you forever. The way they create tension and build up certain scenes is incredible. A lot of very clever and brilliant ideas were thought of for this show. From the cinematography, the plot development, the character development, the editing, the soundtrack/songs, sound design, the titles of the episodes, the use of color, metaphors and symbolism. It's all beautifully and masterfully done. The show also covers psychological problems that men and women face. Focusing more on the psychological troubles that Walt, Jesse and Hank have to deal with. It's interesting seeing how they overcome their problems. The show also highlights the problems that can arise if men don't have their ego and pride in check.

It's amazing the way the plot progresses, the different events that happen throughout that change everything, the characters and the way they develop. It's interesting because they take a simple approach to writing the show. They don't make things complex or convoluted or ambiguous. But they also don't hold the viewer by the hand or treat them like a monkey. It's this beautiful approach to writing that makes this show one of the best. The characters are beautifully written and fleshed out. They're given so much depth and personality that you can't help but become invested in them. One of the best parts of the show is seeing how all the different characters interact with one another and how their paths interconnect with one another. It's a masterful character-driven story with depth. It's brilliant how they also do social commentary on American health care, the fast food industry, the drug industry (including the Cartel) and the legal system.

Although it can be a quite dark, gritty and violent show at times, it never gets overly bleak and always manages to lighten things up with some humor. This is one of my favorite qualities if a movie or show can pull it off. They get really creative with some of the camera work and cinematography. It's pretty terrifying how quickly his personality can change in the blink of an eye. One minute he'll be passive and calm then the next he's intimidating, confrontational and intense. His split personality is both fascinating, gripping and scary to experience. It's kind of like Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde. He ego trips like crazy and his pride is out of control. He's a manipulative pathological liar and isn't scared to make people feel inferior or bad. It was always fascinating to see when Heisenberg would come out and when Walter would just be family Walter. It's this spontaneous side of him that was always so refreshing to watch. It's crazy seeing how many people's lives he affected (and not in a good way). All the lives he destroyed or changed including his families, friends and everyone around him. Every single person that dies was a result of Walt and his actions, his choices. I mean, talk about a man becoming a monster.

Jesse is such a beautifully written character. He's definitely one of my favorites. I feel for the guy. He's put through so much at the hands of Walt and yet has a kind heart. He's also everyone's punching bag. Everyone takes out their insecurities, their frustrations, their problems on Jesse and he just has to deal with it. Such a tortured soul, and it's so sad because his parents cared so much about him. Hank was another incredibly written character. Seeing his transformation and character arc was fascinating. Hank's flaw was that he dug too deep and his was too persistent, relentless, determined and obsessed with seeking justice. He was willing to do whatever it takes to catch Heisenberg. Such a beautifully flawed and human character. And what an amazing performance from Dean Norris as well. Skyler starts out as my least favorite and most disliked character in the show, but then eventually she turns around. Mike is another character I really liked as well. Gus, Saul and even Tuco all amazing characters as well. Even Tio!"
10.0,31 October 2008,"Absolutely one of the most ground breaking bad ass shows on the screen, (pardon the pun). Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.

I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets.

How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch.

The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone.

I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)

10.0,8 February 2015,"It's hard for me to be super objective about this show. Over the course of 62 episodes, right from the start, for me, Vince Gilligan and his team of writers and directors crafted a piece of neo-noir-western American tragedy that almost never, if ever, lost its footing. In its story of the rise and fall of Walter White (or his fun alias Heisenberg) and how he becomes a Meth ""Emperor"" in Albuquerque during his run of lung cancer, we get all kinds of dramaturgy here. There's conflict, conflict, conflict going on in this show, always, from the familial (what do I tell my wife, Skylar, or not tell her, what doesn't she tell me, how far do the lies and deceit and horrors go?) to the more genre-leaning (how much criminals go in their crazy s***, which is established early on with the throw of the particular chemical and the ""This... is not Meth"" explosion) to the dark comedy that gives the Coens a run for their money (Better Call Saul!) - not to mention how it made Aaron Paul just as much as star as Bryan Cranston, both working actors along with Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt and Bob Odenkirk. It all... fits.

Often with a show it's easy to let things slip, even (or especially) on the great shows when it comes to character dynamics, repetition, things that can be hard to control over the space of such a long period of time. But everything is so carefully mapped out, season after season, for the unpredictable to keep happening and for the dramatic beats to gain tension and mystery. Just take how the writers set up, so patiently, over a season, the opening clues of objects and debris all outside of a house, and when you finally find out what all this is about - BAM right to the gut.

What one comes away with, outside of the tremendous performances (you might gripe that Cranston got too many Emmys, but... what didn't he deserve with every fiber of his acting bad-assery?) and the consequences that are built up for all the characters, including those we think are made of rock and steel (Mike Erhmantraut), is the world of moral terror. What is morality in this world? There isn't any. It's the Wild West, but crossed with something like, I dunno, American Beauty. What happens when you take a hardcore drug-gangster tale of suspense and warp it with dark comedy about what it means to be a man in society today, or what it means to have a family (and believe me, there are many moments that are downright haunting, harrowing to the soul that speak to this, especially as it builds and builds in its last eight episodes)? You get... this. Perfection.

I wish I could tell you there's problems with the show, but rarely can I find any. I'm sure if I dug deep enough some might be there, a cliché exploited for the drug-war scenarios or having a baby around for easy drama or theatrics. But so many times on this show you - or I should say I - get thrown curve balls that really have no other way of working out except how they do. When a moment like Walter White in his crawl space discovering a terrible revelation and going from agony to abhorrent laughter arrives, it's just one of those amazing moments of drama in any American medium. It might be throwing praise like gravy on a Thanksgiving platter, but I'm reminded of Nicholson's comment once on Kubrick: everyone acknowledges he's the man, and I still think that underrates him."

10.0,18 August 2019,"PERFECT

Season 1: 8 stars.

Too awesome. Such an intriguing start, especially the opening scene of the pilot. A perfect example of how to do setup while simultaneously having major plot points. You feel the tension immediately.

Season 2: 9 stars.

Amazing. Great escalation.

Season 3: 9 stars.

Wow. Continued escalation plus two of the most memorable scenes ever. Jaw-dropping moments.

Season 4: 10 stars.

I continue to emphasize how beautiful the escalation is. So much stuff happens. Major plot points regularly (something modern shows forgot how to do). And the climax/conclusion is one of the smartest examples of writing. The finale is one of my favorite episodes of any show ever.

Season 5: 10 stars.

Perfection at its finest. So smart. So amazing. Nearly every episode has as much major plot points and excitement as a normal show's season finale. Several scenes with unmatched levels of tension. The escalation is even more escalated. Best show ever.

(First 4 seasons plus first half of season 5 - 4 viewings, second half of season 5 - 3 viewings, 8/18/2024)"
9.0,19 September 2023,"Often hailed as one of the greatest TV ever made, Breaking Bad lives up to the hype. You will be hard pressed to watch a show that is as well shot, directed, acted, and written. Being a finite series, the story told feels complete, compelling, and doesn't drag out into unnecessary and disappointing filler episodes. Every minute of this series is masterfully crafted and designed to encapsulate the viewer into a once in a lifetime experience. Instantly becoming a classic must-watch show, I cannot name anything that I would have wanted different. If you haven't yet seen it, you've been missing out and I hope you take the time to experience such a perfect show."
10.0,27 March 2018,The plot line is great... the acting is good... it has all the makings for a great show but for me it was just so dark and depressing I can't call it a favorite.
10.0,12 January 2014,"I decided to watch this after hearing how good it was - I hadn't watched any of it by the time the last episode had aired.

After watching the pilot I thought that the show had potential and was looking forward to getting into a new show - (having just finished Dexter and whilst The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones were both on a break).

The short first season spent its time building us up for nothing to actually happen. But as it was quite short and all I had heard was how amazing this show is I opened up Season 2. This was very much of the same - every episode building up to something but not much actually happening.

Admittedly Season 3 was a bit better but still quite boring in comparison to many people telling me it's the best TV show ever. In all honesty I haven't bothered with the last 2 seasons as I feel that I have lost several hours of my life watching the first 3 and it's not worth putting the effort in watching the rest. There are plenty of TV shows worth watching before this one. I cannot honestly see why this program has high reviews."
10.0,2 March 2021,Best show you will ever watch. It will exceed your expectations.
10.0,26 January 2008,"As the clueless, hapless and hopeless father of four on the celebrated series MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE, Bryan Cranston came into his own, as he did an amazing balancing act that juggled slapstick, pathos and insanity all at once, proving that not only did ""father NOT know best"", but more than likely never would.

Now he essays the role of another father in the new series BREAKING BAD, but it's a shocking, bracingly refreshing turn that takes his 'Three Stooges' repertoire of grunts, shrieks, barks and neurotic ticks and virtually throws them out the window. Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.

This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel.

Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer.

Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).

You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to ""ask nicely.""

Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)

A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been ""edited for time and content"" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.

And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys. I sure hope he does...thanks to his work on BREAKING BAD, he'll need it."

10.0,13 September 2015,"To be honest, this show is OK, but it is nowhere near worth the hype. I watched the first three seasons in full and was not compelled to watch the next episode after the season three finale. The depth of this show is ankle deep. The characters are not quite believable, and sometimes, downright grating.

I contribute the success of this show to: binge watching availability on Netflix, and the easy money mentality. It's OK, but if you are looking for a drama that is actually compelling, look elsewhere. I think the only reason this show has such a high rating, is the fact that it has such a hard-core following. So if you feel that you might like it, go ahead and give it a shot. Apparently, the IMDb reviewers think it's the best television series of all time. But in my opinion, is it really better than the intricacies and depth of character in Lost? The wit of Friends? The plot of Game of Thrones? The well thought out House of Cards? It is rated higher than all of these...

The answer is a resounding NO."
9.0,4 September 2024,"Made an account just to write this. The absolute magnum opus of television shows. No show will ever provide the feeling this one gave me upon watching it for the first time, and I have seen them all. The only contenders for a show coming close to matching this one are the wire, sopranos, or game of thrones, but unfortunately they all fall short of this. I am upset i did not watch this as it was airing live on AMC, but so grateful to have seen it in its entirety shortly after.

An absolute 10/10, breaking bad offers the most intense and bingeworthy drama of all time. Fiction has never been so masterfully portrayed. I truly feel sorry for people who gave up on this show or who refuse to watch it for whatever reason. I have never felt so empty after finishing a series as i did with this one. If you havent seen it yet, do yourself a major favor and watch it right now."
10.0,22 May 2019,Breaking Bad is my favorite and great series ... I advise you to see this ... Adrenaline is needed for you ... :D
10.0,28 July 2024,"I'll start off by saying if you haven't watched Breaking Bad, get on it asap.

The first few episodes start off a bit slow but it's all up from then on. Each season gets better and better, ending on a perfect note (in my opinion).

Each actor plays their role perfectly, character progressions is great, storyline is genius and each season will keep you at the edge of your seat.

I've watched BB at least 3 times now and would recommend it any and everyone.

The only downside of watching BB is that it sets the bar so high that anything else will pale in comparison. That and the fly episode......."

5.0,3 February 2023,"I wish I'd never seen it so I could see it for the first time again.

It's the story of an underappreciated chemistry teacher with terminal cancer who decides to ""break bad"" and get into the drug business to ostensibly make a quick buck for the sake of his dependent family before kicking the bucket.

But of course things aren't so simple. Even though Walter is a scientific genius and has most of the answers, he doesn't have all of them. On top of that, things aren't so easy as they look.

Even at face value, this plot is compelling and the product does not disappoint in that regard. This is a substantial work in the action genre with superbly directed scenes of violence and rage.

Yet the deeper level may be what takes Breaking Bad to the highest pinnacle of art. The series is marked by unparalleled intricacy in its characters dipped into this simple premise that would make quite an adventure on its own merits. Even characters which would usually be neglected, like Skylar, Walter's housewife spouse, is a tower of complexity. Her motivations, urges, and errors lead to dire consequences for others even though such a character as pregnant suburban middle class homemaker in work of realism would initially appear powerless.

Over the course of the series, this intricacy of the characters coalesces into one of the finest works of tragedy in fiction. Hamartia in the form of excessive ambition, pride, or commitment combine with the simple truth that things aren't as clear cut as they appear at face value to lead to truly powerful scenes and explosive conclusions.

A frank and mature exploration on the meaning of love, life, family, loyalty, and so much more.

Not to be missed."

10.0,15 November 2022,"Breaking Bad is without a doubt the best TV show ever made. Everything about it was just phenomenal. The acting, writing, cinematography, all of it. It is truly a masterpiece and large step forward in television. It proved shows could feel as realistic and quality as television and was able to engage audiences and build a world of it's one using this technique. We get to watch the transformation of Walter White from mild-mannered chemistry teacher into drug kingpin. The great part about White is that the transformation is a slow burn, so to speak. The show has received numerous awards and nominations and is still speaked of highly 14 years later. It really effected me so much I was depressed and feeling empty for 3 weeks after I finished watching it. It has the perfect ending and the seasons get better as they go on which is rare and rewatching it I still find all these new details its just so well written. I highly recommend watching it if you haven't yet I promise you won't regret it."
10.0,14 February 2021,"I honestly don't understand all the hype for this show. Probably in 2008 it was a revolutionary series but now in 2021 in my opinion it's not as good as everyone says. In my opinion, the first three seasons are very boring, the fourth is a bit better because it has a lot of epic moments and the fifth season is the one I liked the most and to be honest it's the only one that really interested me. However the characters and their evolutions are incredible and photography and direction are also excellent."

Because it is tough, has a lot of black humor and above all, it makes you think about the miserable world of sociopaths and psychopaths, no matter how flamboyant it may seem at one point. A real revelation for me was the actor Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman character, a very good actor from the young generation.

4.0,24 November 2019,"You read it right. This show just blew me away. I wasn't even a huge TV show fan. I would peek in from time to time on popular shows for some good entertainment, but none of them hooked me. It was just something I would do when I was bored.

Then came Breaking Bad. I got lucky. One night, about six years ago or so, maybe seven, I was watching a classic movie on AMC- I think it was Goodfellas or Gladiator- one of the ones they always show. The credits went to black and I was expecting another movie in the lineup. Instead, I saw a unique shot in the desert and a Winnebago barreling through with some khaki pants flying through the air, as it revealed a guy in a gasmask driving it in his underwear with another guy passed out.

At first I thought it was another 90s Hollywood movie, maybe something in Vegas like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or something quirky like that, but then I realized it wasn't. I had no idea what it was- I had never seen this ""movie"" before. But I couldn't stop watching. Soon, there was a commercial and I realized it was a TV show.

And let me tell you...what came next was literally the best and most well spent TV/movie viewing hours that I had in the better part of two decades. What went onto occur blew my mind at every turn. The genius and brilliance in the subtleties and acting that came forth was unbelievable.

I barely left my room for three days as AMC was running a marathon on what is now widely believed to be the greatest show of all-time, but I had no idea about that then. All I knew is that I couldn't stop watching and felt like I was addicted to it....Just so intriguing, beautiful, real, amazing, and shocking.

Then came late season 4 and season 5, and I was speechless. It's not that seasons 1-3 weren't great, but when late 4 and 5 arrived, I practically jumped out of my couch and lost it. I was not expecting anything like that, but it was hands down some of the greatest filmmaking I had ever seen going back to the 70s. Honestly, words just cannot describe it. All I can say is this is the greatest show of all time. Enjoy."
10.0,27 May 2019,"Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more. Fast forward to 2019. Looking through Netflix I came across this series once again so thought I'd give it another go. Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house. So to my friend I owe an apology. I should have listened to you and watched this great show a long time ago."

10.0,3 February 2014,"Let me start by saying that I am not trying to start a fight or insult anyone, just expressing my own opinion. It's very hard for me to get into new shows as I find them quite repetitive; to me, ""Breaking Bad"" was no exception.

I don't know or understand how this show got so many 10/10 reviews. I have to agree the writing was good, but after a while I found a lot of it redundant. It was simple- two guys manufacture meth, they need a distributor, the find a distributor,their partnership goes sour with their distributor, they find a way to kill their distributor, rinse, repeat....add in a little moral questioning, some bromance and there you have it- how to write ""Breaking Bad.""

Personally speaking (again), I found shows like Nip/Tuck (though far more far-fetched)a great deal more interesting and creative than BB.

Again, just my opinion"
10.0,20 April 2021,In my life I have found this as one of the most overrated web series.

9.0,14 November 2017,"Everybody has their own opinion of how many stars a show deserves, whether more stars or fewer it's seldom so many people agree. ""Breaking Bad"" is possibly the best TV drama ever made - there isn't a wrong step, bad episode or miscast character throughout the whole series run.

A willing suspension of disbelief is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is probably not plausible to believe that anyone like Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught let alone the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic characters, who nearly all resonate with most viewers, make you willing to set aside any differences with plausibility (which, admittedly, the show takes huge liberties with).

Like most serials it is best not to watch the show out of order! More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you might not want to miss a minute in this original and daring TV drama once you start watching!"
10.0,6 October 2020,Wish i could erase my memory just to watch this show with the excitement i had in first time and having no idea what will happen. It is the greatest TV Show i have ever watched. Acting and writing is just perfect.
10.0,23 May 2019,"I am not one to beat around the bush so here it goes:

This show is epic in its entirety. The writing, characters, plot, cinematography, the pacing and the incredible transformation just pushes this show into a league of it's own. It takes you into a world we haven't quite ever seen before, a world where the sad and unaccomplished Walter White turns into a genius mad-man. You can see the character evolve into a selfish, power-hungry villain who you just love to hate. Vince Gilligan did an amazing job not following the lead of most tv shows out there right now. He knew how to build a story without making you feel like you are underwhelmed and when he knew it was time for this show to end (although I felt a hole in my heart for days after the finale), he didn't care about the money or the fans or the critics, he just ended it the exact moment it was supposed to end.

Bryan Cranston is a power house and completely embodies first Walter White, and later Heisenberg to such amazing heights, you really cannot see anyone else acting this part. That is what, I believe, sets his character apart from most characters we see on TV. He dominates every episode and that is not the say that the rest of the cast don't put in their best efforts (they are all amazing in their own way), but he just has this energy that is undeniable and you cannot help but root for him and the crazy plans he comes up with.

Epic is the only one word you can use to describe a show like this. The only show I feel sometimes touches the bar of this pure excellence, is Vikings and it still does not come close to how well thought out Breaking Bad as a whole series truly is."

10.0,15 April 2010,"To say this program has great writing is an understatement. BB has the best writing I have ever had the pleasure of listing & reading (I always leave the captioning on). The acting is top notch by Cranston. It is also very good by Aaron Paul (Pinkman), Dean Norris (Hank), Betsy Brandt (Marie), RJ Mitte (Walt junior). Unfortunately, it feels like Anna Gunn (Skyler) is the weak link. It is hard to know if the Gilligan is trying to make a somewhat awkward and unlikable character, or if it is just not hitting the mark. I prefer to think that the writing is intentionally odd for Skyler for some reason, and that we will get to learn more in the episodes and seasons to come. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant for the most part – it almost always rings true. The episodes are gripping (for the most part). The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. I have to opt for a 10/10 because there is not another program that comes close – even Dexter which I've been enjoying for 5 seasons doesn't have the writing or acting to stand up to BB."
10.0,11 November 2022,"Breaking Bad is a perfect series. This is a fact. In the past, there were movies and series. They lived in a very different universe from each other. Nowadays there are cinematographic television series. In the 70s, 80s and 90s, series such as Full House, Seinfield and Family Ties with the formula of Sitcom and Miami Vice, 21 Jump Street and Starsky and Hutch with the formula of detective fiction appeared. In 1992, Twin Peaks appeared, a series with episodes of almost an hour long, with a cinematic style, including having been created by a film director, David Lynch. Other series emerged with a cinematic style, such as The Wire, Oz, Mad Men and The Sopranos. Breaking Bad is the most cinematic of them all. Walter White is the most complex and best-developed character in the history of world television. There are dozens and dozens of memorable and memorable scenes in Breaking Bad. The series holds up great over five seasons, which is no easy feat. It's also impressive how the series managed to build a sensational episode in which more than 30 minutes of episode take place inside a laboratory. The episode ""The Fly"", serves to develop the relationship between Walt and Jessie. The figure of Walt\Heisenberg is a very emblematic figure. He is the personification of the anti-hero. The series remains one of the best series of all time or perhaps the best."
10.0,14 March 2021,"The first three seasons are boring, there are so many unnecessary scenes!! Then it gets better especially in the last season. Directing and acting are phenomenal."
10.0,1 February 2014,"I finished the very last episode (""felina"") today and felt a sort of disappointment - I was hoping that this critically acclaimed ""best show of all time"" would get better, turn into the masterpiece that everyone seems to consider it, at some point become interesting, or, at the very least, worthy of my time... it did not.

At no point was I invested in anything going on. Never did the show manage to lure me in, make me care about anyone. There were no interesting characters whatsoever (Except for maybe Saul Goodman, but he was hardly the main character) - sure, it packed a bunch of great performances, the actors honestly did a truly good job, but what's the point when the script is so devoid of character, boring and hopelessly uninteresting.

The show might be considered a good character study - Walt's descent into this becoming a nigh-monster who will stoop to some extremely despicable things is somewhat eye-catching, but this could have worked as a movie, maybe even a one-season show, but as it is, breaking bad is simply too pointless, boring and devoid of any sort of charm to be considered a good show."
10.0,26 August 2021,"This is arguably one of the best things created by the human race.

Without a doubt the best series of all time. Pure perfection.

I gave it a chance, and it won my heart. I wish i could forget the series so i could experience it for the first time again."
9.0,5 December 2016,"Some years after writing for ""The X Files"", Vince Gilligan created a show. I only saw scattered episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" during its run, but I finally got around to binge-watching the first season. Bryan Cranston puts on one of the most chilling performances in TV history as a terminally ill teacher who turns to manufacturing crystallized methamphetamine to support his family. Basically, the show is about moral ambiguity and how actions have consequences. Indeed, each episode adds a new complication.

When I first read about the show during its run, I saw a picture of Bryan Cranston with a beard, glasses, and a shaved head. Having known him as the dad on ""Malcolm in the Middle"", he looked unrecognizable in that photo. But he's proved himself to be a truly versatile actor in the past few years, with roles in ""Contagion"", ""Argo"", ""Godzilla"", and ""All the Way"" (as Lyndon Johnson).

In the meantime, this show will offer some of the most unusual chemistry lessons. Outstanding show. It deserved every award that it won.

I wonder if Vince Gilligan has ever gotten comments about ""Gilligan's Island""."
10.0,24 October 2021,"I finished watching Breaking Bad 8 years ago and was blown away by how brilliant it was. Original story, great character building, comedy, drama... edge of your seat moments...this show has it all.

After all these years I've started rewatching on Netflix and I'm every bit as obsessed with it now as I was back then.

It is absolutely unrivalled television."
10.0,10 February 2022,"THIS SHOW IS IN MY TOP 5 OF THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER WATCHED IN MY WHOLE LIFE!

ALL PRAISE FOR THIS SHOW IS LITTLE."
6.0,1 February 2024,"For me it is the greatest TV series of all time.

The show is better written than any other show I have ever seen. The entire storyline is a sweet cake of masterpiece and Walter White's classic character arc is the cherry on top of it.

The story seems like it was well crafted from the very beginning, like every action has a thrilling and/or heartbreaking consequence. It built it's reputation well on its villains. Vince Gilligan's genius embodies 99,1% purely great story.

Mostly I liked the episodes Face off, Ozymandias, Full measure, Salud, and of course Felina. Breaking Bad is one of the few TV shows that delivered a satisfying conclusion. Iconic characters like Walter White, Jesse, Saul, Mike, Hank and Gus were well written."
2.0,10 January 2024,"Wow. I've got to say this is the best series I've seen for a long time, if ever. I couldn't stop so we watched it over a few days.

Brilliant acting. Fantastic assortment of comedy, frustration, infuriatingly suspenseful. Times of incredible sadness.

The storyline just gets better and better. The change in Walt will leave you shocked and also understood. Compassion and frustration for his young counterpart throughout the series. This series is well worth the time to watch. I'm ready to watch again.

If you choose to watch, be prepared to be entertained from beginning to the very end of this show.

Walt is a little nerdy at the beginning. He's smart, clever, inventive... and dying. He needs to provide for his family financially. Thus begins his trip down meth lab creation. Walt entwines an ex student, Jesse, to help him with his quest. Together they make for a comedic, annoying, frustratingly close partners in crime. Breaking Bad is their story and, what a story it is!"
10.0,8 December 2021,Im watching the show for the fourth time now and it's still entertaining. The story is well planned out and the acting performances of Bryan Cranston and Aron Paul is amazing.
10.0,2 February 2024,"This is hands down the best series to date. It has everything you would expect in a good series. I watched this when we had to wait a week for the next episode and I didn't miss an episode... But now that I own the dvd set I binge watch it.

Very well written ,the acting is phenomenal. As far as the crystal meth scene in this show. I swear whom ever wrote this was most definitely familiar with how things work in the underworld. Jesse is my favorite character and Aaron Paul kills it. I can't tell you how many one liners I got from that show. It's a show that is definitely worth checking out. And Good Job to the makers of itm."

10.0,9 March 2020,"....you like the first few episodes. If you do, then great. If you don't, you will do what I did and waste a lot of time going through some tedious and mind numbing TV, constantly waiting for it to get better. It didn't for me. I didn't like any characters, the pace was painfully slow at times, episodes can be missed entirely and no one would care (fly!), and there was a lot of filler. I will say, the way it ended was excellent, but not enough for me to recommend sitting through series 1-4 to watch it"
10.0,16 July 2022,"No review here!

I'm just here to say that go for it! Literally just go for it!!

It'll your worth time!

But just keep in mind that don't hurry for thrill in first 2 seasons. There's more after that. After you have successfully completed 2 seasons with patience, you are ready to jump into thrill!"
10.0,13 August 2024,"When a piece of popular culture is touted as the best of its kind there is often two types of reaction. Those who enjoy it so much they believe it is the best and appropriately sing its praises. However you get those with expectations so high that it does not live up to them and ultimately feels overrated. Greatness is in the eye of the beholder, but personally I think Breaking Bad is one of the best serialised television shows and ranks amongst my other favourites like 'The Wire', 'The Sopranos' and 'Deadwood'.

The writing consistently impresses me throughout the seasons. Vince Gilligan's famous pitch of a character arc that goes from 'Mr Chips to Scarface' sounds like an ambitious if somewhat impossible undertaking, but is achieved in the most effective way possible with the character Walter White. The two signature qualities of the writing are: 1) they keep you invested in Walt's journey from start to finish by continually manipulating your emotions; 2) they frequently paint themselves into corners with seemingly impossible situations, but find a way to move the plot on from each one in a plausible way. Additionally, it has powerful moments of drama, suspense, and dark comedy that linger in the memory. There are aspects that involve a willing suspension of disbelief. I. E. The main premise, timeframe and convenient appearance (and non-appearance) of Walt's cancer symptoms, but if you accept these details you should get the full impact of the story.

A lot of the success must be credited to the actors. Walter White is an iconic perversion of the American dream, embodied so well by Bryan Cranston it is the type of career high point that is impossible to reach again. Likewise, Jesse Pinkman is a tortured, sympathetic and important character that the brilliant Aaron Paul will never likely match. Bob Odenkirk's Saul Goodman is so entertaining and impactful he justifiably generated his own spin-off, that in moments is every bit as good as Breaking Bad.

Great support is provided by the likes of Anna Gunn, Jonathan Banks, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandy, RJ Mitte, and Giancarlo Esposito who all play wonderful supporting characters. Other recurring cameos such as Laura Fraser, Jesse Plemons, Raymond Cruz, Mark Margolis, Charles Baker, Matt Jones, Julia Minesci and Steven Michael Quezada all are strong contributions.

What sets Breaking Bad apart is the visual storytelling. Although the dialogue is fantastic it never relies on anything other than the cinematography and editing to tell its story. Several episodes have distinctive cold openings or flash-forwards that we spend the next 45 minutes (or entire seasons) intrigued about how we got there. Plus there are so many great situations where an initial unexplained event or piece of imagery becomes clear as we watch the full sequence unfold. Add to this the incredible desert landscapes, quirky POV cams, perfect use of light, shadow, props, set-design and general image composition and you probably get the picture that it is inspiring filmmaking.

The only aspect (purely personal preference not quality of filmmaking) where I think other shows like 'The Wire' and 'The Sopranos' have a slight edge over Breaking Bad is in my motivation to rewatch. It has been over 10 years since I first saw Breaking Bad because it is the type of story that loses some impact when you have too much familiarity with what's coming. The others I find less so and have so much humour and variety in the writing I can rewatch every 3-4 years and never get tired.

For me Breaking Bad is a 9.5/10, but I round upwards."
10.0,22 August 2022,"I wanted to leave this field empty, but it since i need to put 150 characters i will only add that the cast of this show and Vince Gilligan have reached a peak of perfection when it comes to tv shows. You shall be remebered through eternity."

2.0,2 August 2024,"This tv show was amazing it had almost everything you could ask for it is the greatest tv show besides the wire that is a 10/10. There was no episode that was considered boring, even the worst rated episode ""the fly"" has 7.5 on IMDb. The acting is some of the best from AMC before the walking dead existed. The actor show runners etc etc put so much emotion into to a show that i have never seen. You can watch this with a VERY wide audience too, despite it being MA it only is for violence and swearing. If you ask me you should give this show a try atleast you wont regret it at all. ( The wire is good to)"

10.0,10 February 2015,"10/10? 9/10?

Before people start bashing me with dislikes I gotta say, I watched the entire series this summer because a friend of mine recommended me as the single best TV show to date, as well I read reviews on several website recommending Breaking Bad as a must watch. By the end of the show I still don't get how or when this show got such insane amount of hype that made most people praise it as the Overlord of TV. I am not in any way saying Breaking Bad is bad, far from it, Bryan and Aaron are great actors, and the tragic plot is believable enough for me to stick with it to the end, but calling a show which only benefits from when Bryan and Aaron are around can't be called a Masterpiece. Breaking Bad isn't a masterpiece, its side characters and villain are way far from original, Walter ""home time"" is the pure definition of bore, as an incredible slow pace, some episodes fell meaningless to the overall point of the story, the women on this show are a disgrace as characters, one is worse than the next, etc. TL:DR - For some reason this show is highly overrated, described as one of the best shows around, but its that is just now true, at all. At best is good TV, a good drama, with a good anti-hero, a show that most of the times can figure out itself, if it should be a comedy or drama. Just don't be on the hypewagon, Breaking Bad isn't really that worth."
10.0,14 August 2015,"Was expecting good things from this as everybody kept going on about it and had some great actors in it, but was very disappointed. It took me 2 attempts to watch it all. 1st attempt I only got to season 2 ep2 and gave up because I was bored. 2nd time round I watched up to season 4 as people said that's when it got good (It didn't get any better as far as I was concerned) I only finished it because there was 1 season left to go. It may have been better if I had of watched it before sons of anarchy but I had watched sons of anarchy before breaking bad and in my opinion S.O.A takes some beating and breaking bad came nowhere close to it. It was very slow and to be honest it was kind of like the saying ""same s**t different day""."
10.0,12 January 2024,"The king of kings for a reason. Exceptional characters, great plot, good action and, even in the early seasons, good pacing.

Some people will try to tell you this show is overrated, it has a slow start, etc. It does take its time to build up conflict, but there isn't a single moment of the show you can really consider boring.

As most top tier TV shows, every scene is significant, every character unique and every plot point relevant, but BB has a unique way of creating tension and defining its characters through conflict.

All seasons are amazing but it gets better as it goes on, and the last two seasons are straight up masterpieces.

Of course, I wouldn't advise to watch it with the idea that it has to be the greatest show of all time and every episode will blow your mind. Just give it all your attention and I can guarantee it'll pay off."
10.0,21 May 2019,It has been said Breaking Bad is the perfect example on how to write a perfect script. That couldn't be more true.
10.0,18 August 2024,
10.0,23 August 2024,"Breaking Bad is an extraordinary piece of television that transcends the boundaries of its medium, offering a narrative experience that is as intense as it is intellectually stimulating. This series, created by Vince Gilligan, stands out for its masterful storytelling, intricate character development, and its unflinching exploration of moral ambiguity.

From the very first episode, the show grabs hold of the viewer's attention and refuses to let go. The journey of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine kingpin, is as compelling as it is tragic. Bryan Cranston delivers a career-defining performance, transforming Walter from a desperate man into a ruthless figure, all while retaining a semblance of the person he once was. Cranston's portrayal is complemented perfectly by Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman, whose own arc is equally profound, navigating themes of guilt, redemption, and survival.

The writing is nothing short of brilliant. Each episode is meticulously crafted, with a narrative that weaves together tension, dark humor, and shocking twists. The dialogue is sharp, often loaded with subtext, and the pacing is impeccable, gradually building up to moments of pure suspense. The cinematography and direction further elevate the show, with a visual style that captures the desolation of the New Mexico desert and the stark realities of the characters' lives.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Breaking Bad is its exploration of the consequences of one man's decisions, not just for himself but for those around him. It poses deep ethical questions and examines the lengths to which people will go when pushed to their limits. The show doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of the drug trade, yet it does so without glamorizing it, maintaining a stark, often gritty realism.

The supporting cast, including Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, and Giancarlo Esposito, add further depth to the narrative, each delivering powerful performances that enhance the central storyline. Esposito's portrayal of Gustavo Fring, in particular, is chilling, providing a counterbalance to Walter's own descent into darkness.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is more than just a television show; it's a masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact. It challenges its audience, subverts expectations, and ultimately tells a story that is as much about the human condition as it is about crime. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates top-tier drama, and it has rightly earned its place as one of the greatest television series of all time."
7.0,23 December 2021,"Just amazing. I had heard that it has boring scenes but I didn't find a single boring scene. I have rated 10 for each episode, it is a wonderful story and the cast is fabulous."

10.0,19 January 2015,"I watched the first three seasons of Breaking Bad.

I liked the series, although it is much more flawed than I expected.

What I liked:

excellent cast and chemistry between the lead actors - refreshing take on drug crime genre - some very funny moments


What I disliked: - too many lengthy parts - often we're caught in really boring everyday drudgery that the producers apparently didn't have the heart to cut out - too many incongruent parts over time - the character development is weak and made me want to switch off after a while. I kept watching purely for the quality of the actors (who make up for it somewhat) - way too many clichés - too much repetition - some characters become irritating after a while, because they lack real growth (e.g. Skyler)"
10.0,21 February 2021,"It was a good show , not the worst I've seen obviously, but it was kinda boring to watch. Any ""plot twist"" they tried was pretty obvious, and I really couldn't engage with the characters or care for them as I thought I would before watching it . You already know what's going to happen in the beginning of every season , and to be fair , it's not worth the hype . Walt and Jesse's relationship is just the weirdest thing I've ever seen... and Skyler is just awful . It's a good show , watch it if you have the time and want , but there are others that are way more addicting and better written."
9.0,29 August 2024,"""Breaking Bad,"" truly one of the best TV shows in history, masterfully blends suspense and drama, leaving viewers intrigued. With Vince Gilligan's creative genius, you find yourself breathless as you watch an ordinary chemistry teacher, Walter White, unexpectedly descend into a life of crime. The rising tension in each episode, the depth of the characters, and the twists in the story keep the audience glued to the screen. Bryan Cranston's unforgettable performance and the show's compelling storytelling make ""Breaking Bad"" not just a series, but a masterpiece. That's why I highly recommend this amazing series to all of you."

If you are in the same boat as those two previous things, watch the show right now. It is even better than what people say it is. Despite knowing how the show ends, almost every second of this show still kept me captivated and interested. I fell in love with the way the characters are studied and presented. My only issues with this show have to be that the two brothers have some really corny scenes, and there are some parts that don't make any type of sense. However, the amazing cinematography and the emotions that the show got out of me in the last 3 episodes really made up for those flaws that I had to rate it so highly."
4.0,4 October 2022,"What hasn't already been said about Breaking Bad?

It's brilliant.

4,500+ reviewers here on IMDB have probably said all that needs saying - but I've just watched it all through again and I'm gonna add my bit.

We don't know the drug producing criminal underworld. We don't know the anger of a frustrated genius. We (in the main) don't know how we would think if we had cancer and not much time to provide for our family. Breaking Bad starts with these things and boy - does it get bad...!

Everything about this works. There is a bit of Jesse in all of us, a bit of Walt in all of us, Skyler, Marie, Hank - they are all a lot like us. But some have different capabilities than others.... The characters and acting is excellent, the camera work in New Mexico superb. The story, drama and the build-ups are relentless.

It's the descent, the ego, the destruction of - pretty much everything. Then there is the fragility, the feeling of ""in-too-deep""; so many feelings are brought to the surface here - all in a completely extreme but somehow believable way. Breaking Bad is extraordinary."
8.0,25 February 2014,"The outline is clear. Most people will know what it is about even those who haven't seen the show. The teacher who decides to take a step into darkness. And the consequences, he and others have to suffer because of that. Bryan Cranston is superb in his portrayal of Walter White the chemistry teacher, who after being diagnosed with cancer, decides to take matters in his own hands.

Having met an old pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, both undergo a journey, that has its up and downs. But while Walter White has his family (and all the relationships feel realistic), there is a special bond that is hard to explain, between Mr. White and Pinkman. Trying to depict every little great aspect of the show would take too long. The show itself though does take its time, building up tension and when it gets released, it is heavy! Be it because of the action involved or the emotional impact.

The first season may seem to have a very slow pace, but even so it has more than its fair share of great moments (I'll only mention the bathtub, which had me almost crying because of laughter). Season 2 picks up and there is almost no stopping after that. There are McGuffins here and there (like the eye of a teddy bear to name but one) and they all enhance the feeling that this show is real. Feels real that is. The show is obviously for mature audiences, because of its content. Which is the violence and the behavior of characters, not any nudity!"
10.0,25 January 2014,"Breaking Bad is a magnificent,outstanding and completely original television series that is filled with fantastic character development,action and an endless amount of highly intense and un-forgetful scenes .The series starts off fairly promising,and then as it continues it just gets better,over the course of five years,it never a goes downhill,and there isn't a single bad episode in the whole series.I think people were skeptical when the series first came around about the the dad from Malcolm in the Middle starring in a drama,but Bryan Cranston delivers an exhilarating performance in this,Walter White is nothing like Hal and thus proves that Cranston's range is amazing and he truly is a great actor,the change in Walter over the course of these five seasons proves that.But Cranston shouldn't have all the credit,no actor in this show comes across as unprofessional,but the outstanding actors have to be Anna Gunn,Aaron Paul,Dean Norris,RJ Mitte,Betsy Brandt,Bob Odenkirk,Jonathan Banks,Giancarlo Esposito,Charles Baker,Matt Jones,Jesse Plemons and Krysten Ritter are all some of the series best characters and incredible actors and they all deserve so much credit for making this's series so great,and of course,Vince Gilligan,for his incredible writing and directing skills,this show would be nothing without him.My favourite characters of the entire series are without a doubt Jesse and Mike,their personality are something that really appeals to me,and their development over the course of the series is very pleasing,I loved Walter as well,but I never felt like I could relate to him,not that I would want to.All in all,Breaking Bad is a fantastic series,it never disappoints and I would recommend it to everyone.

Walter White (Bryan Cranston),a highly intelligent high school professor,joins the crystal meth business using his amazing skills in science to create a high quality and addictive product,after he learns he has lung cancer and wants to make enough money for his family to use when he's gone."
10.0,12 January 2019,"Walter White (Walt) has a high IQ but couldn't always succeed in life, but an opportunity occurs just when Walt gets terrible news. The opportunity comes with risks and terrible scarifies that Walt normally wouldn't take, but the need for money forces him to take it.

The character build of Walt is unique in some ways - only a few shows have done as great as job as the character development of Walt. The world of Walt is not as ""grey"" as the real world and hence the struggles of Walt are presented in a different way. This way enables the show to present the real-life struggles in a kind of art form. This way comes with more drama, action and comedy than, probably, possible in real life.

Sounds great right? While the supporting characters have ""reason"" to cry. So, they complain about different things. The wife of Walt wants to get evolve with the world of Walt, but right away wants to stay away. While she doubting her life, she feels free to burden Walt with her troubles. At the same time there is a junky, that has a terrible life, because he is doing drugs. While, I hear you say, he is doing drugs because of reason A or reason B right? Hahahaha don't let laugh, he irritating character that destroys the TV show.

So, Walt is great and the story is beautiful. However, expect for Walt there are a few characters that contributed something positive to the show. Still it's worth watching, but there are better shows out there."

10.0,18 December 2015,"Albuquerque, New Mexico. A chemistry teacher, Walter White, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. By chance he runs into a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman, who is now a crystal meth dealer. This gives him an idea on how to pay for his medical bills and provide for his family upon his death...

Fantastic series. Starts innocently enough and builds tension and momentum with every episode. So many dangers and hurdles in his path - from small time hoodlums to drug lords, his wife, plus Walter's own brother is a DEA agent!

In addition, while their enterprise is a very illegal one and one with some unique challenges, Walt and Jesse's struggles are relatable. Most of the issues they face, especially initially, are what all small businesses face - finding a location, distribution, capital, supply, competitors, regulation, restless (in this case, homicidal!) partners/shareholders - and the series demonstrates this quite superbly.

The Walter White character arc is also quite something to behold.

It's not just about the plot though, everything about this show is fantastic. Direction is incredibly innovative, especially for a TV series. Clever use of camera angles and shot depth. It's the sort of stuff you only usually see in movies and then Orson Welles-directed ones at that.

Wonderful cinematography and scenery: great use of colour and the vast, unspoilt New Mexico landscapes.

Casting and performances are spot-on: nobody puts a foot wrong.

Absolutely brilliant."

9.0,29 September 2021,"Please watch all the things you want to watch before watching this masterpiece.

Whenever i watch a series , my head starts to compare breaking bad with it. I just can't watch a show without comparing it to breaking bad. How will any other show justify itself?"
10.0,16 April 2021,I eagerly want to want to watch again but after some years so that i can forgot the scenes and dialogues and i want to experience this epic show once again as i did before. Honestly speaking NOTHING WILL COMPARE WITH THIS SHOW. AND THE FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE IS GOD LEVEL EXPERIENCE.
6.0,4 November 2023,"I can't describe how this show made me feel. I went through all the emotions while watching it, and when I finished it, the only thing I could feel was emptiness. I just wanted to erase it from my memory so I could watch it as if it was the first time.

I got very attached to the characters and seeing the entire journey and decline of Walt and Jesse was incredible but devastating at the same time.

All the characters are extremely important and deep. Certainly Walt and Jesse were the most impactful characters, Walt is one of the best characters ever created, and despite him being an idiot and destroying the lives of everyone around him, you just can't hate him, because everything that involves him leaves you fascinated. And Jesse is just the sweetest person in the world, I would easily die for him, he didn't deserve anything bad that happened to him and he's a character that you can feel empathy for and get attached to.

(Jesse, you deserve the world)"
4.0,1 August 2022,"Breaking bad is the most consistent tv show I've watched. Vince Gilligans writing is absolutely incredible. I could probably watch this for the rest of my life and not be disappointed. The cinematography is possibly the greatest advancement in the whole world.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for an amazing show. The only thing that is missing is nothing."
10.0,23 February 2008,"What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while."
10.0,14 August 2017,"Not quite on this website, but at least on others, this is ranked as the greatest TV show of all time and it's pretty easy to see why. Everyone should be familiar with the story already. It's about this guy named Walter and his assistant Jesse who sell meth initially to raise money for Walt's family as he hears he's dying but eventually himself becomes selfish and destructive. Right from the get go, we get a fantastic set up and iconic images and characters. Probably the main reason this show was so wonderful was simply because it didn't try to be anything more than it wanted to be.

It just wanted to be a realistic representation of the increasing insanity of an ordinary person and the huge web of destruction he got himself entangled in. There are so many unique and profound characters in this show that it's hard to name them all. Okay, I can still remember the two main ones I just mentioned. Maybe the main appeal was that this show didn't go on too long. It had a very defined story that it wanted to tell and it wasted no time in telling it right away. It just seems like not a single episode of this show was wasted.

What's amazing is how smart these characters are, especially Walter. From the very first episode, we see how observant he is noticing all the little details in everything and how they can help or hurt him. The story continually builds on itself until the massive explosion in the last episodes, giving the viewers exactly what they want. It may be the most dramatic show I have ever seen in my entire life. Everything is so intense and realistic. It's great that a completely ordinary show manages to be so effective and influential. ****"
10.0,21 March 2020,"Midway through season 5, and I cannot understand the hype..... Mostly BORING."
10.0,9 May 2021,"I had high expectations on this show. Started watching and waiting for it to be any good. Then realised that I started on the second season and still found it boring. I guess I didn't find the plot believable or interesting and that the characters just acted stupidly. Sorry, but not a show for me."
10.0,9 August 2021,"It is not enough to even make long reviews about this series.

After watching this series, I entered the world of TV series for good.

An excellent series in every way.

It has already become a classic."
10.0,19 October 2022,"I finally got around to watching breaking bad in 2022, more than 10 years after the show first premiered. This is at the top of the list for best rated shows and it's a series that has been recommended to me a lot of times and... wow. What an absolutely outstanding piece of television.

It's perfectly paced across 5 seasons, bringing gripping portrayals of what feels like real people. The events are shocking, real, clever and all around well written and though out. The show brings out so many different emotions, and will take you on a rollercoaster ride through twist and turns. Ultimately culminating in a near perfect ending, that will leave the audience satisfied, but with a sense of dread as the credits roll one final time. The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, capturing and you see a lot of the same techniques being used in movies and others show to this day.

Breaking bad changed the industry while bringing some of the best portrayed and written characters ever put to screen. Now I wish I could erase all memory of the show, so I could watch it for the first time once more.

10/10."
10.0,29 October 2021,"What is called good?

It's something that stands out from other kinds of things.

What kind of thing is called wonderful?

It was something completely beyond anything contemporary.

What is impeccable? It is not only beyond ""wonderful"", but also wistful. It has a meaning and emotion that you don't have to think about.

So, this show is impeccable."
9.0,13 September 2022,"I watched this as it aired so I've not seen the earlier seasons for many years now. After Saul I thought I'd re-watch it, see if I still think it's great and settle the debate about which show is better.

Yes it's an easy call to make. BB is sooooo much better than Saul it's not even a debate. Saul is very very good. And it has some amazing moments and great episodes and I'd say the character arcs in Saul might even be better/more rewarding than those in BB.

However, BB is just one of the best shows ever, it's like crack you just keep watching and the story, acting, cinematography, colours, pacing - it's all just spot on!!

It is the best show ever made in my view but it's fair to say I haven't seen everything, so I'll say it's the best show I've ever seen!

If for any reason you haven't seen it, do."
6.0,5 September 2021,"Season1: not bad~Worth 8.8 Season2: uh, just so so...Worth8.9 Season3: unbelievable. Worth 9.2 Season4: brilliant. Worth 9.6 Season5: Jesus, Christ! Worth 10.0."
5.0,2 February 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" has 5 seasons and a total of 62 episodes. It stars Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris and RJ Mitte. The series has gained a lot of popularity over the years, and let's face it, it really is a masterpiece to be praised.

Directing: Sometimes even too good. Every director who worked on the series did a great job.

Writing: Very brilliant. The whole story of the series is impressively written.

Acting: Absolutely fantastic! Every actor brings out their best.

Editing: The editing is also very commendable! It's outstanding and unique.

Soundtrack: Every song is great. There are a lot of vocal songs in the series, but for example, there is also the great, catchy intro by Dave Porter (who scored several songs for the series).

All in all, this is a brilliant series that is absolutely worth watching. I can only recommend it."
10.0,18 July 2022,"I've been around a long time and I've seen a lot of television, but I've never been hooked on a series like this one nor have I seen so many others hooked at the same time. This epic and excellent series performed the remarkable act of getting better each and every season with two of its greatest episodes near the end and the finale. The performances are all superb, but let's face it. It's the writing that makes this so amazing. I didn't start writing reviews on here again until this year (a few prior years worth were erased by someone) and I never review things unless I watch them again, but I'm not sure I will ever watch all of this again as there is so much television these days, but I might, so this is an opinion from the past and I doubt a second viewing would alter my view. This is magnificent."
10.0,17 October 2022,
10.0,27 April 2021,I seriously don't get the 9.5 ! The last episode of season 4 was just the perfect ending. Season 5 is so messed up ! So many things do not match up ! So disappointing.
10.0,7 May 2021,"It's not that much good show as all say. Personally, I didn't find it good at all. You rather go and start reading a book instead. The three first seasons are totally time wasting. There is no excitement in it. It might be interesting to the people who love. It is all story on top of another story. It is like all day sitting there just listening to a story. No excitement, no entertainment, totally there is nothing that you could be thrilled by this show. In my point of view, just read some brief document about the movie and start watching it from season 15. You would have guessed the previous ones by that time and you would have really enjoyed it more than start watching it from beginning.

Don't waste your time.instead just read a book; i think that might be excited."
8.0,31 July 2023,
10.0,10 December 2022,"This is, in my opinion, the best show ever written start to finish. I avoided the show during its heyday due to all the hype, and watched it after the fact. Not a single show will leave you as satisfied as Breaking Bad does start to finish. Once you get sucked into the story, there's no looking back. There are other great shows out there... Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Lost, etc..but what all of them tend to suffer from, is a drop off in quality at some point and a weak ending.

Breaking Bad does not suffer from this. Season one is as good as Season 5. And the finale is so good.

My only single gripe, is that the neo-nazi characters did not compel me as much as the previous season villains, but the show still was as strong as ever, if not the most intense ever, as we neared the final conclusion.

Find time to watch it, you won't regret it."
10.0,28 April 2019,"Breaking Bad is definitely in the top 5 of my all time best TV series . I have just finished watching it for a second time and enjoyed it just as much or more than my first viewing. Can't understand the bad reviews that this show is getting but ""To each his own """
10.0,22 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is one of the ahem.. the best tv series to exist in its genre. It is absolutely flawless, amazing character development, flawless acting."
7.0,25 January 2024,
2.0,7 January 2014,"I have never seen a show that I loved so much from the start until the very end. It never went down in quality, actually I feel it become even better in later seasons. And while not everything that was happening was what I liked, I still thought that it was done brilliantly. I am just sad it is over, I could go on watching it longer.

Created by Vince Gilligan, the show goes about a chemistry teacher Walter White who gets cancer and tries to make money for his family by getting together with his old student Jesse Pinkman and cook meth. The relationship between the two is one of my favorite parts of the show. They have such a great dynamics, so much chemistry (no pun intended) and seeing their friendship develop going through bumps etc. was beautiful.

All acting on the show is A class. Just as characters. So many different people very complex and greatly performed by the actors. This doesn't just go to the characters I loved, but even the ones who I didn't like, such as Walt's whole family. Their performances made the shows as great as it is just like the plot did.

And I must say, I found out some spoilers ahead of time. But watching the moments was still very intense and sort of unexpected. This shows how well it is done. The show is not only unpredictable because of ""what happens"" but also because of ""how"". Watch it! This is the best show of our time,impossible to not enjoy it and it will be a classic. I will try to follow the work of the creator and the actors from now on."
10.0,26 July 2015,"Having just watched the finale of Breaking Bad, I can now say that it is one of the few series that work perfectly from beginning to end. This isn't to say it couldn't be criticized - it was often far fetched, and in the first season the series didn't quite have a hold of its characters, with Walter making some overly-sudden shifts and Jesse's IQ seemingly wandering up and down - but it was always incredibly intelligent and entertaining, the acting was always amazing, and the show managed to effortlessly move from gritty realism to flights of fancy (like that mariachi song that began one episode).

It is wondrous how beautifully formed character arcs are. Walter, who loses tiny pieces of his soul in ever episode, Jesse, who lets himself be lead into deeper and deeper waters, and Skyler, whose underrated (and often castigated) role is perhaps most relatable; she has to choose between the rock and the hard place, and knows from the start that there are no good options.

What's most impressive about Breaking Bad is it never fell apart. There were no extraneous episodes, no period where it lost momentum or seemed to be treading water. The show moved with purpose. It knew what it was about - consequences and arrogance - and it never lost sight of that. It was a series that remained true to itself. Some series start great and lose their way (Lost), some series fall apart in the end (Battlestar Gallactica), some get taken over by people with a different vision (Gilmore Girls), some brilliant series get canceled in the first season, so no matter how good that ending was going to be, we'll never see it (Earth II). Breaking Bad gave us five virtually perfect years, and the only thing bad about it is now that it's over I need to find something new to binge watch."
8.0,18 November 2013,"What can be said about this spectacular saga that hasn't been said before? One of the very few series that competes with the best films in history for cinematic storytelling. Like a great novel slowly unfolding, it's funny, heartbreaking, incredibly tense, deeply disturbing.

A nebbishy high-school science teacher finds he has lung cancer, so becomes a meth dealer to make money for his family before his death. Often visually stunning, with a breathtaking performance by Brian Cranston in the lead, and great work from all the supporting roles, this portrait of a man's decent into hell couldn't be much better, and it just grows darker and more disturbing each year.

In a way, thematically it recalls ""The Godfather I and II"" in how that epic charts Michael's journey from innocence to darkness, along with the moral murkiness of the American drive for money and success - how we lose ourselves, so that succeeding and having ever more becomes an end in itself for which we will pay any price, rather than a route to happiness, trapping us in a game we can never win.

Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff."
10.0,3 November 2014,
8.0,23 September 2018,"I know the story is good but God that show was boring. I just couldn't binge watch it all at once. It took me like 3 months to watch. Some people think it is really worth it, well I think not!"
10.0,21 February 2020,"This is by far the greatest TV show ever.

I was expecting the typical path every show takes with the same old predictable directions they go in, but luckily I didn't read online and knew nothing of the spoilers. As a result, I was taken in and blown away.

The casting alone is brilliant. Every single character was casted perfectly, and I mean perfectly. That alone is genius and falls along the lines of Pulp Fiction with the way Travolta, Thurman, and Samuel L Jackson were casted, along with Harvey Keitel.

But then you get absorbed into this world you never thought you would meet, nor have you ever seen before. You keep waiting for it to become a typical show and for it to ""jump the shark"", but as the seasons progress, you just never witness or experience that at all.

Instead, the show actually takes you to a place that you never saw coming (if you didn't know spoilers), and it is actually a place of truth. This experience defies twenty or more years of cinema, including the movies.

No matter what anyone says, I don't care, this is possibly the greatest cinematic experience I have witnessed as a whole since the mid-90's. You cannot even compare it to other TV shows, really, because it is not a TV show as much as it is a 60 hour movie that never circles or tangents itself like every other ""TV show"".

The acting is incredible. Every single actor or actress nailed their role. The subtexts, themes, and profundity is all in there, but not everyone will find those things. A masterpiece?.....Is there a term for something beyond a masterpiece? If there was, then this is it.

20/10"
10.0,25 April 2020,"A great series, especially the first, fourth and fifth parts .. There is some boredom in it, but it is worthy that one is following it carefully."
10.0,22 March 2021,
7.0,26 May 2020,"Watched Breaking Bad a few years ago, was really addicted to it. Watching this series all over again right now during this coronavirus pandemic. Still very enjoyable. It's no doubt top notch TV series. However, this time as I get to the late seasons, somehow I just grow more and more angry about WW by each episode. Sometimes feel an urge to just smash his wrinkled bald head. Feel almost zero empathy towards him. Feel angry about the damage he did to his family and people around him. Yes and the scripts and acting sometimes get a little over-dramatic. This style works better in Breaking Bad than ""Better call Saul"" -- the latter one I had to give up after 2 seasons despite its stellar reviews."
4.0,25 May 2020,"A very worthy contender for the greatest TV show of all time. Has there ever been a story so unique, so compelling and so well-developed? Not only do we have breathtaking drama, there is also a touch of dark humour that gives the show an extra dimension. Breaking Bad is completely devoid of cheesiness and predictability but never falls prey to pretentious artsiness.

And then there is the acting. Bryan Cranston's performance is staggering and the character development of Walter White is possibly unmatched in television history. Aaron Paul, Dean Norris and Giancarlo Esposito are also just ridiculously good.

I truly feel sorry for every other televison show as they are pretty much all left in the dust by this masterpiece."
10.0,28 September 2024,
10.0,6 August 2024,"Have you ever felt like breaking bad? Well, this TV show will make you feel like you're not alone. Even though it is one of the darker television series for its age rating (r16) it leaves unforgettable memories and experiences for anyone who watches it.

The impact of Breaking Bad on the landscape of television cannot be underestimated. Created by Vince Gilligan, the series surpasses the traditional boundaries of television, going deep into the complicated and often shadowy realm of morality. It seems as a thought-provoking reminder that the contrast between good and evil is far from clear-cut, making the viewers think about the consequences of the choices made in moments of need. Breaking Bad challenges its audience to explore the degree of ethical boundaries and confront the complexities that live within each of us.

At the core of Breaking Bad lies the cryptic character of Walter White brought to life by the remarkable Bryan Cranston. Cranston's rendition of Walter's transformation from an underprivileged high school chemistry teacher to a formidable methamphetamine manufacturer is nothing short of mesmerising. His performance is filled with a tapestry of subtle nuances, offering a touching depiction of the gradual erosion of Walter's morality. Through Cranston's portrayal, viewers are compelled to empathise, fear, and even pity this multifaceted character whose choices propel himself into a dark and perilous journey.

Opposite Cranston, Aaron Paul embodies the role of Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student soon-to-be drug-dealing partner, with a stunning display of vulnerability and emotional depth. Paul's acting captures Jesse's inner demons and existing struggles with haunting precision, drawing viewers into a world of pain, regret, and the need for redemption. The dynamic interplay between Cranston and Paul on screen is electrifying and empowering, serving as a testament to the show's ability to weave intricate character relationships within a morally charred narrative.

The visual storytelling in Breaking ad is an art form in itself. The cinematography masterfully captures the barren landscape of Albuquerque, New Mexico, contrasted against the gritty underworld of drug trafficking creating a visual separation that mirrors the moral conflicts that is imbued within the series. Utilising stark lighting, bold colours, and creative camera angles, the show heightens tension and suspense, imbuing viewers in a world that is both visually striking and emotionally rich.

Beyond Its narrative of crime and punishment, Breaking Bad is a heartfelt exploration of the human condition, serving as a study of the intricate complications of morality and the destructive power of uncontrolled ambition. Through its masterful performances, gripping nature, and visually captivating aesthetics, the series encourages viewers to confront their own ethical dilemmas and navigate the grey areas of right and wrong. Breaking Bad serves as a compelling reminder that our choices not only define who we are but also shape who we may become.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad stands as a monumental achievement in television, offering a heartfelt examination of moral ambiguity and ethical decision-making. Vince Gilligan's portrayal of these morally challenged characters challenges the viewers to reassess their own perceptions of right and wrong, while Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's powerful performances breathe life into characters struggling with the consequences of their own actions. The visual language of the show further elevates the storytelling, creating a world that is as visually captivating as it is thematically potent. Breaking Bad is a testament to the enduring impact of morally nuanced narratives, leaving an unerasable mark on the landscape of television storytelling.

10.0,29 April 2021,"I seriously don't understand why this gets 9.5 stars..... The show is above average at best. Sure, the acting is solid, the story has plot twists and Esposito is great again but 9.5......???? I don't get it......."
10.0,13 January 2021,"I have genuinely watched every episode and for every great episode, and there is some truly brilliant episodes, there is an amazing amount of dross. Series two is in particular tedious. I can't remember when Saul came in but it stopped me from dropping out. Basically I was cajoled in to finishing the show. It is watchable but be prepared to endure Skylar and others moaning and groaning then moaning and groaning some more as if they were in some Greek Tragedy."
10.0,10 July 2022,"After i finished watching this masterpiece since 2020 i watched a lot of series but i'm still very convinced THERE'S NOTHING can be great as BB i don't think there will be anything like it in the future , characters , acting , script , and especially ending , some people thinks the first seasons are not that great but when you finish watching everything you will release what first seasons were about , watch it guys you won't regret it, hope you enjoy it and you will."
10.0,10 March 2024,
10.0,3 October 2024,"Breaking Bad is the greatest show ever!

Some shows entertain, others teach, but Breaking Bad? It changes you. I'm giving it a perfect 10/10, not just because it's flawlessly crafted, but because it pulls you in so deeply that it becomes impossible to stop watching. If you haven't seen it yet, I can guarantee you're depriving yourself of one of the most gripping stories ever told.

Imagine a regular, everyday man - Walter White - a high school chemistry teacher. You empathize with him. You root for him. But as his world spirals out of control, you witness a transformation that feels so real, so raw, it makes you question your own moral boundaries. How far would you go to provide for your family? And at what cost?

The brilliance of Breaking Bad lies in its subtlety. Every scene, every line is crafted with purpose. The tension is so thick that it doesn't just sit on the screen; it reaches out and grabs you by the throat. The show will make you feel alive. Every moment feels like it's building toward something monumental, and trust me, the payoffs are worth every second of anticipation.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of a masterclass in acting. You start off feeling his pain and struggle, but soon, you'll find yourself horrified by the person he becomes. And yet, you can't look away. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman? He'll break your heart. Their chemistry is electrifying, and every moment between them is a battle of emotions and survival.

But this isn't just a show about drugs or crime. It's about choices. It's about control and the human desire for power. The deeper you get into the show, the more you realize that Breaking Bad is holding up a mirror to your own life. It challenges you to think: What would you do in Walter's position?

If you want a show that goes beyond entertainment - a show that will keep you thinking long after the credits roll - this is it. Breaking Bad is more than TV; it's an experience. An experience that will make your heart race, your palms sweat, and leave you begging for more.

Don't just take my word for it - see for yourself. The only regret you'll have is not starting sooner. Dive into the darkness of Breaking Bad today, and prepare to be hooked like never before.

As you move forward in the story, more amazing characters will appear like Gus. Etc.

I hope you enjoy the show!"
10.0,2 August 2024,"The best tv show you can ever see. I mean everything there is literally perfect. The consistancy, dynamics, entertainment, characters. This show is not so long and Vince knew how to end it perfectly and not do a huge amount of garbage seasins like twd did. I like this show for that. Because there are so many shows when the start is so good but they just cant end it perfectly. I mean Dexter, Prison Break, The Walking Dead they all had so much potential to be the greatest but the lust for money, i guess, just ruined them. But im really glad that Breaking Bad knew when and how to stop. Overall i really suggest to watch it who hasnt seen it already."
7.0,9 December 2021,"Breaking Bad is beyond Masterpiece . It is very realistic , It shows us the tragedy of people and how a man can change . Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are some of the most complex and human characters . The acting of the cast is on point and we can feel every emotion . Every Episode is entertaining and thrilling ."
5.0,5 October 2024,"Breaking Bad is a television masterpiece. Bryan Cranston's stunning transformation as Walter White and Aaron Paul's raw, emotional portrayal of Jesse Pinkman are nothing short of exceptional. The writing is razor-sharp, filled with tension, surprising twists, and profound themes of morality, power, and the consequences of one's actions. Vince Gilligan's masterful storytelling keeps you hooked from the very first episode. Personally, I was captivated right from the start. With breathtaking cinematography, brilliant performances, and unforgettable moments, Breaking Bad sets a new gold standard for TV drama-a must-watch series that lingers long after it ends."
10.0,19 April 2020,"This is the Best Show i have ever come across since DeathNote, the character development and the ups and downs of each character is soooo amazingly done and the story although feels slow at first , did all the justice as it escalated through the seasons. The way Walter slowly turns into Heisenberg and does things without a sign of regret and repent really shows the changes he incurred. Also The Acting of every character in the Story is just sooo much natural and moving , i might not have seen such level of acting on any show ever , especially Anna Gun(Skyler) , Bryan Cranston (Walter) and Aaron Paul( Jesse) . Anybody who hasn't watched it, should definitely experience this masterpiece ."
10.0,18 August 2024,"The cast, the acting, the writing, the cinematography, the music....every single thing in this series is perfect!

The atmosphere that is created is so unique....i have never watched anything this good before and probably never will again! Nothing gets close to Breaking Bad! It is simply the best series that was ever created.

Anthony Hopkins once said Breaking Bad was like a Greek Tragedy...he was right in my opinion. The plot draws you in and you just can't stop watching. The writing is so good, it even makes you root for the villain.

I became a big fan of Bryan Cranston after watching this. Even though I was even hesitant to watch it when my boyfriend first mentioned the series. I was like: you mean the quirky dude from Malcolm in the Middle is supposed to play a Drug Lord!? No way this is gonna be good!

I knew I was wrong after only a couple of minutes into the first episode. The series just has a special vibe and feeling to it. At least for me.

I recommend Breaking Bad 100%. Go watch it, if you haven't already!"
10.0,15 March 2008,"In general, the acting by all in Breaking Bad is fantastic. However, the quality and range of acting by Aaron Paul is truly amazing. Bryan Cranston is getting a lot of attention, which is expected from a veteran actor with his experience. However, it's Aaron Paul's outstanding performance that demonstrates the remarkable capacity, among a new generation of actors, to reveal a world of extreme complexities and harsh realities that we find in today's America.

Aaron Paul's ability to bring to life these contemporary elements is the test of any great actor, at any age. Indeed, Breaking Bad brings a valuable contribution to the realm of quality Television Theater, and Aaron Paul's work here is among the finest to come forward in a long while. Bravo, Mr. Paul!

UPDATE: Great news! Aaron Paul has just won his first Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, at the Annual Primetime Emmy Awards 2010! Congratulations Mr. Paul! ~ e"
10.0,8 February 2017,"Breaking Bad is a good show that is worthy of praise however it is not worthy of iconic status. While it started quite poorly and dragged on in its initial seasons the show certainly improved in the final seasons. Even some of most loyal fans would agree Season 1 had a slow start. Unlike iconic shows that hit the ground running Breaking Bad failed to impress at the start. While the series is about the transformation of a character which came together full circle in the end the series is lucky it never got cancelled at the beginning because of the dullness and unimpressive story lines. Far better shows that showed more promise have not been given the same chance like Breaking Bad but towards the final seasons fans who stuck to the show were rewarded. The series finale has to be the best series finale I have ever seen, it was perfect. Hence I gave a stronger rating.

The stars of the show do a great job with their characters and the viewer enjoys the odd and unusual partnership between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. We also have a few solid performances from other characters such as Gus, Walter's brother in law, Hank, and Saul Goodman who hit it out of the park. However other characters such as Skylar White really annoy and frustrate the viewer. Besides her selfishness and coldness she is simply unlikeabale as a character.

I do not believe it deserves to be in IMDb's top 10. While many say this show is indeed a journey, it was a boring and rocky journey to begin with. It was initially unimpressive, slow and failed to hit the ground running as great shows often do. A good journey contains valuable nuggets or plots that entices its viewers. It is definitely not in the same league as Game of Thrones which can be regarded as an epic.

The spin off show by its creator, Better Call Saul impresses and excels in areas where Breaking Bad falls short. So you better call and watch Saul which is a much better show and showcases far better writing and story lines.

Overall a decent show but it definitely saved its best and very memorable acts for the end - 7/10"
10.0,22 March 2020,"I resisted watching this show while it was on air. I hate things that are hyped because they tend to be let downs.I suffered through the first two season and said that was enough of my life I was willing to give to Mr. White and his do-boy Pinkman. I just didn't get what was so sensational about this show revolving around a middle age white guy who decides to make meth. The character development was so weak I didn't care or root for anyone and I didn't understand Walt's desperate desire to leave money for his family who were two-dimensional and whinny. What was extremely annoying was the dragging out of things out over multiple episodes. Case in point, Crazy 8. Did his act really require 3 episodes?? That time could've been better spent trying to establish a legitimate connect. No we have to watch these clowns bumble their way into the drug business, which Pinkman was already firmly entrenched, for darn near nine episodes. Put a fork in me, I'm breaking bad and not giving this overrated show anymore of my time."
10.0,3 August 2024,"It is a masterpiece that tells human nature, family and friendship relationships, the emotional and psychological states of the individual and presents a powerful story to its audience. One of the most remarkable aspects of the series is the incredible depth, complexity and development of the characters within the episodes. In this respect, it is at a very special point among the series that ""I am glad I watched"".

Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is considered a legend in the television world. Cranston perfectly reflects the complexity and transformation of the character. Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman is also deep and touching. Side characters such as Anna Gunn, Dean Norris and Bob Odenkirk also contribute greatly to the success of the series.

Breaking Bad, which is much more than a crime drama, makes a difference especially with its exciting script, strong actor performances and characters with a solid background. It is also possible to continue the excitement of this universe with Better Call Saul and El Camino. Thank you Walt, Jesse, Hank, Mike, Saul, Gus, Skyler and others."
10.0,1 October 2024,"Finished this show recently, and it's without a doubt the best show of all time. The acting, story, and entire vibe is different. I've seen a lot of good shows but this one's on another level. Seeing Walter and Jesse's relation with each other rising and falling was absolutely fantastic. Not to say the least, the show is interesting and incredibly entertaining. If you haven't watched Breaking Bad, your missing out on the best show of all time, nothing else to say. If you like crime, thrilling and emotional shows and movies, you'll love the breaking bad universe. I've started watching better call Saul as well and it's so far fantastic.

So to say the least, watch it."
10.0,11 January 2024,"Just a killer, solid show. There's nothing I can fault it for. Even the things I don't like, I'm like, well, they contribute to the art, so it doesn't matter. Mexico is green? Of course Mexico is green. This is the Mexico is green show that makes you feel kind of sick.

There's that one episode, The Fly, I believe it's called? I still think about it probably every month. And nothing happens in that episode - literally nothing. Conversation. Catching a fly. But it's so plot integral and perfect

This show is SO intelligent I still lose my mind over how well thought out this is. I'd say it's unbelievable, but it's just art."

8.0,23 January 2024,"For me Breaking Bad stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of television drama, earning every bit of its 10/10 rating. Vince Gilligan's creation is a beautifully crafted narrative that seamlessly weaves complex characters, intense storytelling, and moral ambiguity. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is just something else, navigating the transformation from a simple chemistry teacher to a formidable force with unparalleled finesse. The show's relentless tension, unpredictable plot twists, and profound exploration of morality makes it an unforgetable experience. Breaking Bad is a true gem that sets the benchmark for excellence in television storytelling."

10.0,3 November 2016,"Breaking Bad: A Dissection to Walter White's character Factual Summary Genre: TV Series Title: Breaking Bad, 2008-2013 IMDb Rating: 9.5 / 10 Creator: Vince Gilligan Review centered upon protagonist Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) Reviewer: Adhikary Rabindra / 2016 November

Dissecting Walter White's Character as Mr. White and Hiesenberg From the start to the finish, Walter White has been central among the characters depicted in the series ""Breaking Bad"". It takes little—if any—time to get the insinuation that the series must be portraying the stories based somewhere around complicated scientific deductions or chemical formulas when one sees the banner popping out with Mendeleev's Periodic Table mottled in acoustic aura of mystic music. This must have been a perfect motion picture as a tool that Vince Gilligan has devised to show Jekyll and Hyde character of Walter White, an ordinary high school teacher, who later faces the specter of average income family at least one member of which suffers from a fatal disease (stage III lung cancer when diagnosed)—such that the family has to pay the unaffordable merely to expect alleged longevity, coerce-fully—only to become extraordinary, not to mention the psychological turmoil of everyone involved.

As the plot unravels, it is fairly interesting to see how a boring family old-man—that Walter White, of course—turns to a underworld meth chef, a new normal to his cruel and darker side of behavior intermittently alternating to a kind family guy; indeed a caring husband and responsible father to a boy and a baby girl in the course. The weighted yet intriguing relationship of Mr. White, as is addressed by cooking clans of his, with different individuals, which again varying according to the place, context and the surround, adds more spices to the viewers how one's dual personality complicates the social situations. The first time when Mr. White enters into Tuco's rendezvous is when he pronounces his netherworld name ""Hiesenberg"", being an aspirant chemist and all, coined after Heisenberg's principle, perhaps. The name is then first heard, and echoed, loud and clear inside the meth industries reverberating in the sinusoidal manner to the cartel world, zeroing to customers and blazing to DEA—soon as Heisenberg bombards the Tuco's place with his mystique chemicals masquerading blue methamphetamine crystals, and threatens to reimburse the money of previous 'debacle' trade on top of Jesse Pinkman's—his coworker, injuries, and succeeds. Thus is how Heisenberg establishes his imagery, rather Kafkaesque nightmare for a man like him, unbelievable to whoever have known him, not only near but far and beyond as well. The Jekyll Walter White might be a perfect husband, father and a family friend whereas Hyde Walter White is equally brutal, emotionless individual, who is, at places, called animal even by his meth-cook colleague Jesse Pinkman with whom Mr White shares almost all his business interests. His notoriety could not have reached any farther than poisoning an innocent child with his insidious chemical weapon called ricin to having explicit role in the suicide of trusty business partner Mike Ehrmantraut. Whether his unaffordability to cancer treatment or lung cancer alone knowing that he is surely going to die has caused him to turn into Mr. Tough-Guy-wanted-by-police seems baffling. Or, maybe, he is born that way, only that character precipitates soon after lung carcinoma transcends to his life. He is near perfect in excellently pulling up the rationale for every wrongdoing he commits, sometimes even is busted out for over-reaction—of verbally fabricating unusually intricate details of what happened, how and where. He is best at what he does, as he keeps claiming that—96% and blue color should validate his claim, however; in whole of America, and that's where he reasons that meth-cooking is justifiable at his end rather than to work out a lousy sub-standard product by some lethargic naïve cook, a wastage of precursors, lesser selling price and then lesser benefits at the same time depriving the customers of pure crystal inhalation experience. The later portion includes more of Heisenberg than Walter White, when he gradually and irreversibly implicates himself to a murderer—or so a serial killer even. He is now not only a mere cook, he is the king of Meth Empire after he bombs Gustavo Fring to death or at least that is what he thinks. He keeps on destroying everyone and everyone else in his journey to become millionaire and to escape law enforcement, DEA so to tell, not to mention the destroyed lives of ultimate users of 'blue thing' he manufactures. Day by day he becomes grave criminal in the name of 'providing' for his family, more and more he is pushed further away from uxorial intimacy and family love. Even if he seems to lose trust from Skyler, his wife, he keeps running for money only to save it for her and their children after he will be gone owing to the carcinoma. This has rather happy ending when independently scrutinizing all the felonies that Mr. White has committed. To me, he should have succumbed to more cruel death than is shown, and only in that way the viewers would find more justice in viewing all the way bottom from the start. As a whole the serial is a family drama with interesting mix of crime and violence affecting social virtues of a man and his family garnished with bright colors of joy, love, care, sacrifice and darker shades of victimization, realization and compunction. It also brings about the unpleasant aspect of illegal money, its cohesive and indispensable chain of bummers to the society."

6.0,28 August 2024,"""THIS IS THE GREATEST TV SHOW OF THE WORLD."" This is the line that I Heard everywhere before watching the show. Yes, I had the curiosity to watch the show, but I decided after completing some movies (1.5+ years) I'd watch it & I waited a year. But the line I heard was the cause of I can't wait to watch, so I started it. And what happens? I felt bored in S1, S2, and S3. But I still believe that line so made patience and watching continuously. I even thought, ""All the good reviews I heard are fake"". But still watch. But when I complete the whole series, I regret it. For watching the show? No, but that is what I thought about the show before completing it & now I'm also the one who says that same line. 🔥"
4.0,18 September 2018,"You know a series is a masterpiece when you end up watching it as a re-run merely 6 months after watching the original.

To this day this series, has standards set so high, that I am personally unable to find anything to watch which matches its standards.

I am yet to come across an actor who can play a character which is Walter White who is an embodiment of hero, anti-hero, part-comedic, part-villian. This is not a character which is purely black or white, there are numerous tones and undertones of gray in this character. And yet, Bryan Cranston has not just played such a complex character, but played it par-excellence. His mannerisms, not-over the top, certainly not under-acted either - when the moment requires just a perfect tone of darkness, while also keeping it just a tad comedic too, just barely, since after-all, Bryan is a comedian first. There is not a serious scene in the series, which is not without a sense of comedy. Kind of like life is laughing at you as you go from one situation in life to the next. It would not be unfair to say that Bryan could carry the weight of this series, by himself, based entirely on his acting alone. Having said that, it would be easy to overlook the fact that the supporting actors did a great job too, to create an environment in which our anti-hero comes out the best.

By the time any series reaches Season 5, there is a sense that franchise has been over-done. A series having a good 4-5 seasons continue on for several more seasons, before they are shut down by channel/studio, due to declining ratings due to viewer fatigue. A good series, eventually fades away from audience memory simply because it went on too long. Then the halt comes, and the characters are gotten rid of expediently to end the series. Not Breaking Bad. This is a series which knew how to stop & when to stop. If the idiom ""quit while you're ahead"", applies anywhere then this series would be it. The penultimate Season 5 is not only the highest point in the series, but as Walter White once said(sic), ""There was a point my life, when if I would have died at that point, it would all have been just perfect.""

If you haven't watched it. You should. I am going to watch it for the 3rd time for the lack of anything better on streaming or elsewhere."
10.0,1 July 2024,"This deserves awards still till now this date!!! Breaking Bad is hands down the best series ever made, a true masterpiece from start to finish. With its gripping storyline, complex characters, and impeccable writing, it's a show like no other. Walter White's transformation from a mild-mannered teacher to a ruthless drug lord is riveting, and the performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are unforgettable. Each episode is a perfect blend of drama, action, and dark humor, making it impossible to look away. Breaking Bad is not just a TV show; it's a cultural phenomenon and a testament to the power of storytelling. ✨✨🔥"
10.0,2 September 2024,"The only bad thing about this show is that it makes so difficult to appreciate any other series after you finished watching it.

Every actor is just perfectly casted, from the main characters ones like Bryan and Aaron to the side characters, everyone is just so incredibly skilled and absolutely fits their role.

The soundtrack is unique and I dare to say it became quite iconic over the years.

Last but not least, the story is simply the best I've ever seen, it makes you fall in love with this world and these characters (especially the fifth season, in my opinion the best piece of television in the history of mankind, with the last three episodes being the icing on the cake).

This show is indeed 99,1% pure."

9.0,7 November 2023,"""Breaking Bad"": A Masterpiece of Modern Television

Breaking Bad, the critically acclaimed television series created by Vince Gilligan, is nothing short of a modern masterpiece. With its gripping storyline, complex characters, and exceptional cinematography, Breaking Bad has left an indelible mark on the world of television. Over the course of five seasons, it has garnered a loyal fanbase and critical acclaim, and it continues to be hailed as one of the greatest shows ever produced.

One of the most striking aspects of Breaking Bad is its compelling storyline. The series follows the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer. Walter's journey from a mild-mannered, law-abiding citizen to a ruthless drug lord is a rollercoaster of emotions and moral dilemmas. The show's ability to keep viewers on the edge of their seats throughout its entire run is a testament to its exceptional storytelling.

At its core, Breaking Bad is a character-driven drama, and it excels in creating complex and multi-dimensional characters. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary. His transformation from a sympathetic, cancer-stricken family man into a cold-blooded criminal mastermind is a tour de force performance. Equally impressive is Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner in the drug trade. Jesse's inner turmoil and moral conflicts are portrayed with such raw authenticity that it's impossible not to empathize with him.

The supporting cast of Breaking Bad is equally exceptional. Anna Gunn as Skyler White, Walter's wife, brings depth and nuance to her character as she grapples with her husband's secret life. Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, a DEA agent and Walter's brother-in-law, adds a layer of tension and suspense to the series as he inches closer to uncovering the truth. These characters, along with the various antagonists and allies that Walter encounters, contribute to the richness of the show's narrative.

Breaking Bad is also a visual and cinematic triumph. The show's cinematography and direction are both artful and purposeful. The desolate landscapes of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where the series is set, serve as a stark backdrop to the unfolding drama. The use of symbolism and foreshadowing is masterful, and each shot is carefully composed to convey the story's themes and emotions. The show's color palette evolves as the characters change, with the gradual darkening of colors symbolizing Walter's descent into the criminal underworld.

Music plays a crucial role in enhancing the atmosphere of Breaking Bad. Dave Porter's haunting and evocative score is perfectly matched to the show's tone, amplifying the tension and drama in every episode. Iconic musical moments, such as the use of ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" in the context of the drug trade, remain etched in the memory of fans.

Breaking Bad's exploration of morality and consequences is one of its most thought-provoking aspects. The series delves deep into the moral ambiguity of its characters' choices and actions, leaving viewers questioning their own ethical boundaries. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of good and evil, the consequences of one's decisions, and the human capacity for transformation and redemption.

Vince Gilligan's meticulous attention to detail and his commitment to crafting a coherent and compelling narrative are evident throughout the series. The writing is sharp, and the character development is second to none. The show's ability to maintain a high level of quality and consistency over its five-season run is a testament to the creators' dedication to their craft.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad stands as a benchmark in modern television."

The one and only series where in every episode my jaw dropped for one minute throughout it.

The one and only series where the unfolding of the story and the episodes were flawless.

The one and only series where Meth was a beautiful, attractive and pure hypnotizing blue substance.

The one and only series where the name of Heisenberg was a Brand, driving you mad and forever anchored itself in your mind.

The one and only series where you wished you had your memory erased, to watch it again and again till end of your life.

And the one and only series where standard and quality were redefined all over again.

It was a true and personal honor to know and watch this show. Kudos and special congratulations to every one of the persons involved, especially and foremost to Bryan Cranston. You will be forever missed.

Heisenberg, YOU MADE HISTORY."
10.0,22 March 2010,"First season took off a little slow. It settled up premise, characters, the mood of the show, its world, if you will. It has some great moments though, like body disposal scene from the second episode which made me choke on my own laughing tears.

Second season blew me away. Completely. Right from the very beginning. Second episode Grilled along with sixth episode Peekaboo,being so damn hilarious, bizarre and gripping, I'm sure, will fill find their places in the TV's Hall of Fame, trust me.

What third season will bring, has yet to be determined.

The show has quality to surprise. At first I was a bit skeptical toward it: A school teacher turns to be a drug dealer? Yea' I've heard something similar is already on TV, and I wasn't excited. So if creator of the show appeared to be someone else than Vince Gilligan (who made earlier in his career significant contribution to development of another great show ""The X-Files"") and if the show was on channel different than AMC or HBO, I even doubt I'd give it a chance. By the way, the pilot was shot with intention to be sold directly to HBO, that's why it later was edited for nudity and explicit language by AMC, which still is a cable channel, but apparently trying to remain more ""family friendly.""

""Breaking Bad"" could be ridiculously funny and hellishly creepy, it contains some rough images and topics, not to mention that it's filmed astoundingly, unbelievably beautiful. Juxtaposition of plots, characters, places, even colors and sounds provides unique installments which had me on the edge of my seat, shaking with laughters and shivering with excitement and aesthetic delight.

Show's overdramatization brings us to the part which I praise the most: Style. It's kind of style that first puts before our eyes some quite clichéd soap-like picture: Common middle-America family consisting of middle-aged Chemistry high school teacher, his pregnant wife, and their cerebral-palsy-inflicted teenaged son. Then chain of circumstances invokes some highly absurd and eerie, often impossibly funny, unbearably scary and hopelessly sad situations. It's the kind of style you may find in 50's noir films, in pictures of French nouvelle vague, in characters of movies by Quentin Tarantino, the Cohen brothers and Robert Rodriguez.

In spite of the vortex of intense and dangerous situations the show manages to carry throughout all its episodes some unexplainable vibe of incredible, Buddhism-like calmness. As if we were told some sort of ancient myth or fable. Of course it has a lot to do with sophisticated work of cinematographers and subtle inputs of art designers. Although I usually prefer dark, foggy, shadowy – could be said depressing – cinematographic atmosphere (""Twin Peaks,"" ""the X-Files,"" Millennium,"" ""the Sopranos""), I found myself amazed by crystal clear images of ""Breaking Bad."" Insignificant and empty on the surface, yet filled with dimness and despair; New Mexican sun that doesn't burn you, it gives chills and almost numbs you in the end.

I'm not going to say anything about lead actor Bryan Cranston. His character doesn't speak that much either, it's all written on his face. Aaron Paul's character, on the other hand, has some mouth on him, but don't let him disencourage yourself, yo biach. Their intentions are good, in different ways. But you know the road to hell is paved with what, aren't you?

All of the above combines in highly unorthodox, exceedingly entertaining and fairly thought-provoking top-notch TV-show third season of which premièred March 21st on AMC or wherever you may or willing to get it."
10.0,22 November 2022,"Now I didn't think I would just throw that word around like many other might do about this show, but in reality, upon viewing, I understand why this show is put in such a high regard:

Incredibly engaging throughout the whole journey till it's last minute!

The show manages to keep nearly every moment profound in the larger scale of things in the world of the show, and does so with amazing pacing that makes you want to watch more. While many shows can be deemed bingable and perhaps well paced, I personally have never experienced story pacing like I have seen in Breaking Bad (apart from maybe a few movies).

All storylines, characters, threads and established arcs are wholly completed and play significance till the show hits its last beat. That is what is most incredible; the writers retained coherency and managed to make all of the elements described above matter and ensure that it hasn't wasted your time. A good example of this early on might be the first two seasons, which some people might not initially enjoy because of its less slower pacing. I, along a plethora of viewers, find the two first seasons as excellent as the rest of the show, but when compared, they are technically the weaker part of the show, if you could call it that. But not to worry, these first two seasons are crucial to how the show will end, so if you are reading this: every episode and let alone season matters in the end and will make the viewing experience so much more gratifying.

In the end, I could go on about details and reasons why the show is indeed the greatest show of all time, but for simplicity, these are the defining characteristics about the show I found the most pleasing. Simply amazing."

What a journey! I've watched the whole series in just over 2 weeks and must say it's been a roller coaster.

A truly remarkable piece of work and the last episode has been emotional. I'd only heard of Aaron Paul on Top Gear a while back in which Jeremy congratulated him on his acting, and I applaud both him and Bryan Cranston (who I watched in 'Why Him') are both spectacular - not too sure what can fill this void now!

All the actors in this brilliant piece of art should be congratulated (loved his sons performance throughout (Roy Frank ""RJ"" Mitte))

A truly amazing roller-coaster and would recommend spending the time to watch (don't let the first 2 or three episodes put you off)"

Brilliant actors with a great storyline. A lot of twists that makes it that you want to see the next episode as soon as possible. The suspense that is build in every episode is great. You can't do anything else then hope that Walter White gets away with it. Too bad that at one point the series had to stop because for us it could have gone on and on forever. So we were disappointed when it was over but now that there is a spin off we are already looking forward to that one. If ""Better Call Saul"" is in the same way then it can't go wrong. Anyways, ""Breaking Bad"" is a must-see if you never saw it."
6.0,2 August 2022,"One of the greatest shows I've ever been able to watch in my lifetime. Thank you to the entire cast, production and Vince.

From season 1 to the very end of the El Camino movie, I love every aspect about this show and how it never held back to continue to shock us as viewers.

THANK YOU! MUST WATCH."
2.0,22 May 2019,"If you haven't seen this masterpiece I am jealous because that means you get to see this with out fully knowing how incredible it is. Prepare to be staying up late since you will want to see the next episode. Best character development, writing and acting ever! Go watch it now, thank me later"
10.0,12 October 2022,"Outstanding script with a perfect pace. Vince Gilligan took TV shows to the next level with Breaking Bad. Watching the pilot for the first time hooks the viewer instantly in. The fusion of absurdity and somewhere simplicity of the show and location gives an undefinable essence to the viewing experience that locks the memory of the show deep down. The development of characters is brilliant and Walt's genius, yet narcistic and childish temper produces a perfect blend to a super lunatic villain by the end of the show. The dynamic and fluctuation between the two protagonists, Walt and once Walt's student, Jesse, is a never-ending rollercoaster ride through the entire series that shows, deep down, they are very much alike. The show keeps up its exceptional quality through all five seasons. Truly, a must-watch masterpiece."
10.0,24 April 2021,"Just an incredible show. Loved every second of it.

If you took the suspense of Hitchcock, dialogue of Quentin Tarantino, and the direction of Kubrick you'd get this show.

By the way it's 2021. If you haven't seen the show yet what are you doing?"
10.0,12 October 2022,"This is probably one ot eh greatest TV shows af all time. I had an extremely fun time watching this show. There were parts which were funny and a lot which was serious and had you on the edge of your seat when watching. The evolution of all the characters were shown perfectly, the acting was amazing all through out the show. There were characters which you love and some you hate but these were intentional. The cinematography was amazing. All the camera shots were executed amazingly and the different types really showed you the amazing universe in which Vince gilligan and the others had created."
10.0,24 April 2021,"You will never watch something like this, it is genuinely a must watch."
10.0,7 May 2021,The hoopla surrounding this series. I tried to watch it several times and couldn't get thru an episode. I have run out of things ( and having watched BCS which imo was 100 times better) I decided to start further in like episode 3. I'm now on season 3 and I just don't get it? It's ok but best show ever?!? It's very slow ( unless miraculously it gets awesome between now and the end season) it's just ok. It's definitely not a binge worthy show imo. I'm liking it better now I'm seeing characters from BCS ( whom act completely different except Gus) it's just underwhelming to me. If somehow it gets incredible between now and 5 I'll update this.
10.0,8 November 2014,
10.0,22 May 2019,The character progression in this series is one of the best i've ever seen.There are some boring episodes in middle seasons but that ending makeup for all of it. Who ever wrote this deserves the goddamn presidency. Arguably best tv series everr....
10.0,23 April 2021,Best drama ever! There's no better. You must watch it at least 2 times.
6.0,20 May 2019,"I have never found myself unable to fault a show, everything about it was stellar, the start in comparison to the rest I suppose was a (little) slow but even then, it needed the buildup, the character development, the anticipation for what was to come. You already know he's going to cook meth, of-course he is, so I enjoyed that the start took it's time to establish the kind of man he was and how out of place he was about to be.

I waited over 11 years to watch this show, not entirely by choice but because I too, fell victim to Hype fear and maybeee lacked someone to share the experience with (almost as hard as finding someone who hasn't seen game of thrones).

This show is an experience, it is a glimpse into a realistic, logical world where a man is driven over an edge. There is no suspending ones disbelief, there is really no exaggeration, it feels as raw and real as life. The conversation flows like Eminem in his prime time and is as complex as a 1,000,000 piece puzzle. Characters have the depth of the ocean and the acting paints a gorgeous picture, one where every single stroke on the canvas is thoroughly thought about.

If you're yet to watch this show, try to find someone to watch it with! Being able to talk about it has been wonderful and most people by now seem to have forgotten the plot points I wish to discuss. But if you fail in your endeavour watch it anyway, It's the biggest entertainment based favour I have done for myself!"
4.0,6 August 2022,"This show is something else, it really is the best show to ever exist. Its been months since I finished watching it I still cant stop thinking about it, this show has changed my life for the better. I highly recommend this show, I have never watched a show so addictive and amazing as breaking bad... the development of the character's is amazing, the cinematography is amazing. Please watch this show!"

10.0,26 April 2021,Thank you for existing. This series is just perfect in every aspect.
10.0,3 March 2010,"I first watched this show when it aired, based on a friends recommendation. I heard the premise, and was VERY interested. A middle aged highschool chemistry teacher dying of cancer starts making and selling crystal meth to support his family before he dies. He finds a kinship, and partner of sorts, with a former student/slacker of his, Jesse Pinkman. The first season was cut short, coming in at only 7 episodes, but the second season has the full 12. Give this show a chance, its very addictive. Walter White is a character you want to root for, but sometimes find yourself asking how you can. The pacing of the story is brilliant, as is the creepy foreshadowing of the finale all throughout the 2nd season. This isn't a typical show, with typical character... we empathize and sympathize with Walter White, and hope that in the end there is a reason for all his madness. He starts out as nothing more than a nerdy, over-qualified chemistry teacher, but by the end of the first season, he has definitely grown accustomed to his alter ego ""Heisenberg"", the meth kingpin of New Mexico. Obviously Walter gets himself in over his head, and thats what keeps us so interested... Season 3 starts in a couple weeks, and anyone who caught the 2nd season finale this past summer, is obviously dying to see where it goes from here!"

6.0,6 November 2022,"Breaking bad is by far from my pov is the best web series I've seen, the character development and the story development it's on point, I'll have to say this series is worth the hype it has, i was very much recommended to watch it by my friends so i started the series and i went on I couldn't keep myself from watching it i mean the story keeps u on the edge and every every single episode is better and it just keeps getting better no wonder it has a 9.5 imdb ratings. I gotta say u didn't thought it was going to be good before i saw it and damn it was fire y'all should watch it. I highly recommend."
3.0,14 July 2023,"Do not watch this show. If you do, nothing else can compete anymore. Every other show that's not called ""Breaking Bad"" or ""Better Call Saul"" will feel mediocre or bad in comparison.

There is nothing bad I can say about this show. All the positives have already been states by countless other people. The acting, the plot, the character development. It just all comes together perfectly. It's a thing of beauty to watch unfold, and after watching the series, you will feel a sense of satisfaction and sadness at the same time. Satisfaction in the sense that it's a perfect end to a perfect show, but sadness as there is nothing left other than to stare at the credits and review your life choices... (and watch El Camino and Better Call Saul after, of course)...

Although Breaking Bad is a show about drugs, the show itself is a drug. Know what you start with when deciding to watch this absolute masterpiece."
8.0,18 August 2022,"After huge recommendation and buzz about the series, I started watching on 2016 August, couldn't able to stop it. I have finished two seasons in a flight travel. The best show on the internet completely eligible to do binge watch. You will be travelling along their journey of Walter White or Jesse Pinkman. The show biggest success was how it ended, you can't a find better way to put through. I really wish would have got chance to watch in their release times.,"
10.0,3 November 2022,
8.0,5 December 2021,"This is, hands down, the best show ever made. I've watched it start to finish eight times. I'll probably watch it eight more times. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and watch it today. You won't regret it."

10.0,27 February 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.

What can i say about this show that hasn't been said before. Not much, but here it is. If you haven't seen it yet, do your self a favor and watch, because it's a magnificent series from start to finish. Probably the best accomplished show ever. Not overlong, 5 seasons, in a terrific shape start till end. Everything in this show clicks on highest cylinders, and i mean everything. Acting, writing, directing are brilliant, and what a cinematography - thanks to it you won't feel you are watching a TV show, it's a world itself. Unforgettable characters, villains, deaths, twists (not overwritten!) - it hardly gets better than this. Yes, it has one (just one) weak episode (Fly), of course not by the guilt of creators but just producers and yet they managed to create something out of nothing.

Overall, if you like watching / don't like watching TV shows in general, ""Breaking Bad"" is an almost universal entrainment which you will never forget."
10.0,1 October 2013,"With all the TV I have watched in my lifetime, this one show is my favorite of all time. It has everything: great acting, great writing, it's exciting and intelligent. There is not a single wasted moment, not a single predictable lazy/clichéd storyline in the entire show.

When I first started watching, I must admit I was turned off. The show seemed dark, depressing and bleak. I mean come on... some boring middle-aged white dude working two jobs, putting up with his bitchy wife, a special-needs son, AND cancer? But as the plot goes on, it's soon becomes quite inspiring. What it all comes down to is that this is a story about an emasculated, downtrodden man who finds his mojo. The cancer is his wake-up call; Facing death in the face, he finally begins to embrace life. Watching the transformation is a joy to behold.

Now, I am sure many would protest how I have characterized the show here. It is typical for Walt's character development to be described as as a downward spiral into evil, selfishness, and narcissism. And he does indeed have moments, particularly in the last seasons, where he seems to have hit the moral rock bottom. But I think when you go out and live life to fullest, you have to accept that sometimes you are going to make mistakes, sometimes you'll have to be the bad guy.

In any case, you don't have to like Walt's character to like the show. In this show there are no heroes, definitely some villains, but no heroes. In many stories there is often a trade-off between action and character development; either you have a slow plodding show with great 3-dimensional characters, or an action-packed explosion-fest with little character development or nuance in the direction. But this show has it all; Every single episode has such tight cinematography, excellent dialogue and characterizations, every episode makes you hungry to see the next one and see what happens next. The way the plot unfolds with its ups and downs, exciting moments and slow moments, is PERFECT.

I'm not going to go through every character, they all did a great job, but I have to single out Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse. I think he stands out as the greatest acting performance of the show. His youthful, bright-eyed character is the heart and soul of the show, and he could not have done acted it better.

So anyway, if you haven't seen this show yet, I envy you, because you get to see it for the first time and I can't again. I supposed someone might not like the show if they are particularly squeamish about drugs or violence, but even if you are you might like the show anyway."
10.0,20 March 2020,"I'm usually a big fan of crime/drama series, but this one over here drains your soul alive. I actually watched it all the way till the end to see if it gets any better, but it was just below my expectations"
10.0,30 March 2021,"Breaking Bad is one of the most important series in history, acting is awesome but the story is so boring!! I'm sorry but that's my opinion."
7.0,17 March 2021,"I loooved it very much. Everything was just the best. If the series ended with season 4 it will be the best thing i have ever watched. I do not like the last season, it ruined everything, mr. White changed and i didn't liked him anymore."
3.0,9 August 2021,Breaking bad is stellar in so many ways. And there's so much to it you have to watch it several times. I've watched it 4 times now. Everytime I watch it I see something new.
10.0,10 June 2020,Story and screenplay is good. All lead actors did they job. If I really have to be picky then Anna Gunn could have done little better. Bryan & Aaron needs to be called out for making their character believable.
9.0,17 July 2021,"To put it simply, Breaking Bad is the Michael Jordan of TV Shows. Nuff Said."
10.0,13 May 2022,"Everyone knows about the hit show Breaking Bad, but the level of depth of the writing and character building over the seasons is unmatched by any other show ever created. It's grand scale filmmaking using episodes rather than a 2 hour. And it keeps its pace from the Pilot to the epic finale.

Clearly, I'm a fan."
10.0,14 October 2021,"The best TV show ever streamed, there are shows and there is Breaking Bad, how it builds from the begining and getting intense all along til the finale, the characters writing and acting, no effects or fiction needed just reality that surpass all, it's a journey that will break your heart just for finishing."
10.0,3 February 2020,"Oh Vince Gilligan! What have you done?

Why make such a perfect show that after watching this no other show feels the same anymore. How can this be so perfect ?

Instead of starting another TV show I simply keep watching it all over again. Someone help me."
10.0,1 January 2010,"This series is inevitably the greatest Television entertainment that cable has to offer. The plot line is so creative you don't know what the next episode will be about. With Bryan Cranston's amazing acting ability and character, this show is incomparable and can never be recreated due to the amazing work of Vince Gilligan and his team. The dramatic affect left at the end of each episode makes you crave with wonder. The episodes show so much strength and power that the next plot line would never be thought of by the most extreme ""televisionaholic"" and/or critic. Each episode has a certain meaning and leaves you guessing what will happen on next week's episode. There has been rumor of the series opening a third season in March of 2010, I advise you to watch the other two seasons before starting to watch the new season because, you will be very lost. But with the time brought into watching the seasons you will be absolutely satisfied and there will not be one doubt in your mind that what you had watched was a waste of time. This is an absolute epic show! Watch it! You will be glad!"
10.0,5 July 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a groundbreaking television series that redefined the crime drama genre and set a new standard for storytelling on the small screen. With its gripping narrative, impeccable character development, and flawless execution, it remains an absolute masterpiece.

The show revolves around Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul). As the duo delves deeper into the criminal underworld, we witness the transformation of these complex characters, their moral dilemmas, and the consequences of their choices.

What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its meticulous attention to detail. From the brilliant writing by creator Vince Gilligan to the exceptional performances by the entire cast, every aspect of the show is executed with precision. Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary, as he flawlessly navigates the character's descent into darkness, showcasing both vulnerability and ruthlessness.

""Breaking Bad"" is a must-watch series for any fan of quality television. Its compelling storytelling, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking themes make it a true modern classic that will continue to be celebrated for years to come."
8.0,22 February 2008,
7.0,21 January 2021,"I have finally got round to breaking bad, many friends recommended this, I was missing out etc etc and maybe it was built up too much in my head but was disappointing.

Seasons 1 and 2 took took me a year, it was slow, predictable writing I was not looking forward to the next season.

I continued, 3rd season was better and 4th for me arguably the best season. 5th season again was painful at times, ending was cool but by this point I was just glad it was over."
4.0,4 September 2018,"The main contender for the best show of all time. It was at the top of my list for years, but was recently unseated by another show I'll leave unnamed in this review.

BB is a priceless piece of modern American art. A rare experience that gives life new meaning. Must see for everyone."
10.0,30 September 2013,"Bryan Cranston shows his acting skills portraying the complex character of Walter White. He's a long suffering high school chemistry teacher who suddenly finds he's dying of cancer. With little prospect of leaving anything to his family, he teams up with a former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to make meth. They're so good at it that they become major criminals.

This is the best of television which can be found on cable. Walter White is a complex character that actually grows over the life of the show. He is a good character that we root for at the beginning even thought he's become a criminal. The journey he makes is one worthy of great literature. It is absolutely must see TV."
10.0,26 July 2022,"I finished Breaking Bad around 4ish months ago and i have tossed and turned on a 9/10 or 10/10. Well after being a 9/10 for a while i have now reranked it for what i believe to be the last time.

10.0,23 July 2021,My most favourite show. It's simply a cinematic masterpiece. A lot of good show drops in quality by the end seasons but this show got it perfect.
10.0,18 June 2021,Vince Gilligan take a bow what an incredible show. I can't name one thing bad about this show it's a masterpiece of television.
8.0,6 February 2021,"People really seem to be nuts about this series. So I watched it. And it is good. Especially the script, Bryan Cranston and the evolution of the characters are 10/10. But it sometimes loses itself in its on drama, its to artsy and sometimes it gets in the way of the story. It is also hard to know if it is supposed to believable or not. At times it really feels like ""this could happen irl in a drugcommunity"". At other times, the decisions made by the characters seems really far fetched.

For me, the 3 first seasons are best, and then the story kind of falls apart in some areas.

With all this said, it really is wellcrafted and exciting. Just not as mindblowing amazing that some seem to think."
10.0,28 March 2016,"Honestly, this show is about the increasingly poor decisions of an egotistical bratty man-child who has every opportunity in the world to do right by himself and his family, but still chooses to do wrong with every opportunity presented to him, and, of course, his poorly adjusted younger side-kick. I don't find this show as ""amazing"" as some people oddly seem to find it, but it is a decent show that dramatizes the lives and lifestyles of the meth world from the perspectives of a man trying to live a double life and those who circle around him. Breaking Bad has a good cast that helps tie everything together, which helps save the show from itself when the writing gets a bit wishy-washy and over-the-top. It's entertaining and keeps the viewer coming back for more. All in all, this is a good watch, but expect to cringe at the broken decisions of broken people doing broken things."
6.0,7 February 2016,
5.0,11 February 2020,"This series is a work of Art, like Heisenberg's Meth."
8.0,23 April 2021,"If you haven't watched this show and wanna watch it because it has the highest rating, here's what you'll expect Pros: One of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen from an ensemble cast.(especially Bryan Cranston) Great Cinematography and Directing The plot does not go for too long and ends perfectly and leaves ZERO loose ends.

The greatest TV character ever with the greatest character development ever put on screen.(Walter White) The first 2 seasons are very Character-driven and the last 3 are plot-driven.

The symbolism and the attention to detail (requires you to pay attention to even the littlest things.) The greatest serialized plot ever in a TV show(alongside Netflix's DARK, a must-watch especially for Sci-Fi fans.)

Cons: For the casual viewer the pacing could be very slow.

The realism. There could be some cheesy parts in the story that could be a turn off for you."
10.0,15 November 2022,"This series is amazing, excellent and every episode is exciting . I finished watching this series and the first thing I felt is there is no lag and storyline is properly taken with so many humors , emotions and very thrilling. The cast have done their work so neat and perfect . I loved the character Walter white , "" Bryan Cranston"" **** he is the man perfect fitting for this character. There is no mistake in acting and in every scene he has actted, he is so fluent and he has turned into that character and his lifestyle. He was having cancer and he didn't told his family because he don't wanted them to cause any trouble , he was doing drug business and made a lot of money for his family and they didn't accept it . I really enjoyed watching this series and had a good time . Watch this series once in your life time."
10.0,16 May 2017,"Other people have written much about the characters in the show so it doesn't require me to add to that.

However Breaking Bad has some of the cleverest writing I have ever encountered in the making of a television show. The twist and turns of the story over so many seasons are outstanding.

To any budding script writers this is a almost perfect example of how to write a script."
10.0,27 April 2021,I could watch this over and over again and not get sick of Breaking Bad. Genius filmmaking and the storyline is so good.
9.0,19 May 2009,"""Breaking Bad"" is the darkest show on TV, and possibly the best. The main character, Walt White, is a high school chemistry teacher with cancer, a pregnant wife, a disabled son, and no savings. Hoping to leave a nest egg when he dies, he teams up with a young lowlife and begins cooking crystal meth. Walt and his accomplice are in way over their heads, and get into one harrowing scrape after another, from stranding themselves in the desert to being kidnapped by a psycho drug lord.

Deep ironies abound. Walt's double life entangles him in so many lies he can't keep track of them all. This damages his relationship with his family (who were the reason he started cooking meth in the first place). Unforeseen complications keep sabotaging Walt's drug operation and eating into the money he makes. As he puts it, everything is ""one step forward, two steps back.""

""Breaking Bad"" approaches its characters with a penetrating sense of human frailty and zero sentimentality. Though Walt's a sympathetic character, he does many unsympathetic things. His wife, loyal and moral almost to a fault, nurses a secret crush on a former boss. Walt's young accomplice has an inconvenient streak of decency, but not enough to overcome his own essential weakness and stupidity.

The hypocrisy and ""quiet desperation"" of middle-class suburban life have been worked to death in books, movies, and TV. ""Breaking Bad"" gives these themes new life with clear-eyed, pitiless characterizations, brilliant acting, gripping plot twists, imaginative visual style, and grim black humor. The nearest analogy I can think of is to Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary."" ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece."
10.0,10 February 2008,"This show is one of the bright spots of this train wreck of a 2008 television season. Bryan Cranston has to be IMHO one of the best acting talents out there. Just compare and contrast his portrayal of the clueless father on ""Malcolm in the Middle"". On ""Breaking Bad"" his character light years different. That's not to say that his roll of Hal on ""MITM"" was inferior to the character of Walter White here. However he shows his ""range"" here VS. there. There is going to be the inevitable comparisons to ""Weeds"" and unfair or not there are parallels. Both center on basically good people forced to make due in order to survive or keep their families solvent--bottom line give ""Breaking Bad"" a chance I'm betting you will be pleasantly surprised. My only problem with this show is the incessant bleeping of the ""colorful language"". Either don't include it or don't bleep it, it gets very annoying after two or three bleeps."
10.0,11 October 2020,"Breaking bad is well written, well directed, all the actors are incredible, the whole team does an excellent job on this entire series. You feel (whether good or bad) for every single character on this show, the character arcs and development are works of art. This series will always sit on my top 5 list.

I am so glad that he did. I have been engrossed for the last six weeks watching the full 5 series. I cannot rate this highly enough. The characters, the storyline, the acting, in fact everything about this series was astonishing. Quite frankly I am lost for superlatives by which to describe this production. I will watch it over again in 10 years time when I will be nearly 80. By that time my memory will have begun to deteriorate and it will be like watching it afresh. I can't wait...."

10.0,29 September 2013,"By Far the Best Show on TV Ever! The show captures you from the very first scene of the very first episode. Week after week I sat on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad would unfold in HD and the beauty of New Mexico combined with the masterful writing and cinematography left me breathless. I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I got sad, I was stunned but through it all I totally enjoyed every episode. The show is so solid in every aspect it's a treat to watch and enjoy. From the Pilot of Breaking Bad in 2008 Season 1 to ""Felina"" the sixteenth episode of the fifth season of Breaking Bad and the sixty-second episode of the series altogether. It is the final episode of the series. It's been a bittersweet ride. I love this show and now that it's over I'm burning my TV."
9.0,13 November 2022,"Yes, as many others have written before me, Breaking Bad is without a doubt one of the best series of all time.

The story of how a desperate chemistry teacher ventures into the drug business with a former student of him is brilliant.

Walter White and Jesse Pinkman face many ups and downs during their attempt of overtaking the Crystal-Meth-Market.

In addition, the characters with Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are also perfectly cast. But the other actors play their parts very good aswell.

A clear recommendation on my part.

The series just doesn't get a 10/10 from me because I wouldn't call it one of my favorite shows."
10.0,9 March 2009,"The very best program on TV. This is the first time I have ever felt it necessary to write a review for anything on IMDb. I think that it's safe to say that I was ecstatic with the first episode of the new season after the end of the writer's strike. I hadn't given my hopes up until I saw the second season and some continuity despite the strike, my hopes wouldn't have been given up in vain.

The key to making watchable entertainment is with good writing but the key to making GREAT entertainment is to design characters the audience can relate to no matter how morally ambiguous his actions. Breaking Bad not only does this in dramatic and broad sweeping fashion but with the quality and attention to detail normally reserved for doctoral dissertations. This is certainly Mr. Gilligan's opus.

In Walter White (Bryan Cranston) we find an educated and reserved hero forced into a roller coaster of self-discovery in which the very core tenants of our western traditions in life, morality and human rights are not only touched upon but exhumed, aerated and critically deconstructed. Why, when, how, and for how long? What are the limits of our humanity? For what would we be so compelled as to take the life of a stranger? In Walter White we see exemplified, the most timid of soul we would think least likely to violate the rules of society that bind us.

On top of this delving into the deepest of the shell that is man, we add great acting, striking reality and masterful writing. I love a concrete story without loose ends, this show pays off.

This show, for me, is truly compelling in that I'm compelled to watch every new episode, a first."

10.0,11 April 2009,"Generally, I only watch Sci-Fi, Horror and such-- but every once in a while I'm drawn to regular TV if it isn't run-of-the-mill Canned-Ha-Ha-Ha comedy or standardized Network Primetime Drama with the usual A-Z cast of Beautiful People pretending to mimic Real Life interspersed with Fun Commercials as the rest of us would Like it to be.

The storyline is simple: Ordinary Middle-class Teacher in an Ordinary Burb with ordinary Financial problems with an Ordinary Sucky Life finds out he has Cancer. Which makes every ordinary thing suck even worse. So he turned his Ordinary chemistry skills to Illegality so he can make some money--quick. And we get to watch the whole set of terrible, unfolding, yet still very ORDINARY set of events. And you just KNOW, it's not going down a very good road at all, but like a car with no brakes heading down a long mountain road, you have no choice but to clutch the wheel and hang on for dear life.

I've heard and read of this show described as black comedy. I wouldn't put it quite like that. Black Humor is the best phrase I can come up with-- but the humor is a brilliant side-effect of the story. It's somewhere in the middle-- as in between Black and Grey. . .like Charcoal: the type that comes off on your fingers.

I don't laugh or even chuckle; I wince. I cringe. I say: ""Oh my god! No, No!"" If this is comedy-- it's the comedy that Hurts and cuts. It's the laughter that comes out of an adult mouth that doesn't have a smile on it: and oh yes, he's laughing as only an Adult can.

The people in this show hold me because it isn't the parade of Beautiful People and Perfect Families that Hollywood and the Networks keeps trying to brainwash us with. Painfully ordinary. The houses, the school, the people, the motives, the lighting, the camera-work. And I am watching Working Man Walter White grasp for something lasting to keep hold of. . .and I am ROOTING for him!

This show is Different. It's Drama about Quiet Desperation with an edge of Black Humor that will touch a lot of Uncomfortable places that we are not used to seeing on our friendly Network Screens. Yet when you see it, you are shocked that the creators have DARED to film it and make it look so. . .plausible and painful. Bravo!!"
7.0,15 October 2022,"Breaking Bad is a certified top 3 show of all time. Watching Walter White slowly sink into the crime world was just amazing to watch. Thanks to Bryan Cranstons outstanding performance this series is worth watching solely just because of him. You can't forget the best slightly funny, chaotic, crime duo of all time Walter White & Jesse Pinkman. Breaking Bad can be hilarious at times, but is visceral more than anything. The shocking moments are unforgettable, the sad moments are undeniably sad. The character development not only from our crime duo, but from all our supporting players, it was all just so well done, and will forever be the best series AMC has to offer. And the amazing story lives on thanks to its successor Better Call Saul. The best crime drama story on television no doubt."

10.0,21 February 2021,"I had high expectations for this series because everyone says it's a masterpiece. It took me 2 months to finish the first season, too boring !! The second and third seasons are a little better but they are still very boring. The fourth and fifth seasons are the best but there are still some episodes that are very boring. And most of the episodes don't even end on a cliffhanger so I wasn't even interested in seeing the episode later..."
8.0,26 August 2019,"It is one of the best show I've ever gone through. No fictions, no hypothetical things, it is just simply a masterpiece. In terms of story building, proper linkage of short stories, it is an utter brilliance. A must watch series that has its own best or I say one of the best story writing in drama history. Breaking bad actually has a standard very highly comparable to Game of Thrones. These two shows are just best in drama history."
10.0,24 May 2019,"Amazing show. None of the other TV shows have matched up to the excellence of this one. Such an unconventional plot, also giving us a profound message! Screenplay, storyline, acting everything is nothing less than stellar.

I hope that people would make many more shows with such impactful storyline and some real life lessons.

This series gives out a strong message of being less judgemental of anyone, even if they cross the conventional protocol of the society.

Walter White led his entire life walking on the staight line that society had drawn for him. He was extraordinary in his line of work with unconditonal passion for Chemistry. Even then he gets treated as an underdog like most of the real life heros. He was fearful of everything in life, till he discovers about his lung cancer which in turn makes him break bad."

Everything in this show is like perfect the sounds the plot twists the brilliant events the characters development just so good that will make you so excited about what will happen in the next episode .

I always say that this is the perfect series because it never disappoint you at any episode from the begging until the end.

The journey of walter white and jessy are just perfect because it has got all the emotions sadness happiness and anger.... This show is the best example of a masterpiece."
10.0,21 July 2022,Its crazy how good this show gets. Starts off well enough and only goes up. Cannot think of many shows that can keep consistency at such a high level.
7.0,11 October 2019,"Best series I have ever watched, recommending it for everyone."
5.0,16 May 2024,"All right. Now I am writing this review having already seen the show 3 times.

Season 1: A short season. And I find it an underrated season. Yes, it focuses much more on the dark comedy aspect. But I don't find that a bad thing. The show gets progressively darker as it goes and it started with dark comedy. And good dark comedy also. The comedy is very effective. The best episode in season 1 (which is very hard to pick in this show) is probably ""Crazy Handful of Nothin'"" by a smidge? I just really liked the classic ""This is not meth"" scene. I love the story of breaking bad and how it shows the obvious evolution of Walter White. Who in this season is new to all of this. The worst episode? Pfft....ok.....I guess the pilot because.....it's the pilot? I love the pilot and there is nothing wrong with it. But, ok, I guess the pilot is the worst. Even if it beats every other show in this episode alone.

(I will review season 2 when I rewatch it)"
10.0,14 March 2023,
10.0,1 June 2018,I heard that this show was so good. I wonder what other people were watching. So far I am just trying to stay awake during the first season. The show moves so slow and I keep hoping that it would pick up. I already can't stand Walt's wife and I would like to kill her off. Jesse is worthless. Walt is doing some stupid things. I don't think I can continue watching this mess of a show.
10.0,23 December 2021,Well this show was released in 2008 and I am watching this now and it doesn't look a 2008 series from any point of view. Literally this show is the best in its genre.
10.0,28 June 2024,"While I have reservations about how Breaking Bad depicts the humour and humanity of drug dealers, I guess that's the point. These people are human and for various reasons choose this path. Instead of faceless evil monsters, there are more grey areas. We get an insight into what might be the everyday lives behind the TV footage we see of arrests and court cases. The script and directing are first class and the actors are great. The series does not treat viewers like idiots. I really like the FBI guy. He is a bit goofy and gung ho but his heart is in the right place. Walter, the anti-hero, is a great character but at times it stretches belief how he gets away with various atrocities. His young dealer buddy is a funny and interesting guy although hopelessly addicted and aimless in his life. The wife of Walter, Skyler, is depicted as intelligent and idiosyncratic. I am only five episodes in so I will wait and see how the series pans out. So far it is very watchable."

The best TV show ever made. When they recommended it to me, I didn't expect it to be as good as you probably expected it too. But believe me, be careful, think if you really want it to change your life completely? Are you willing to take the risk? Every time you see something, every time you watch a movie, a series or whatever, now that you've seen breaking bad, nothing will seem as good to you, are you willing to take the risk? Even if you see it and then Better Call Saul (banger too) you will always want more of Breaking Bad, and it's sad to know that there isn't any more afterwards. Your life now has no meaning."

6.0,13 September 2024,"Whenever I see comments about series that feature ""gray"" characters, like Breaking Bad, I realize that people have lost the ability to read layers... For them it must be A or B. One day they will realize that human beings do break bad, being complex, contradictory, making bad decisions, being enchanted by power, etc. An odd meth-cooking couple tries to get their business running. The pace is intense and fun. The overarching plot doesn't have much direction; the story is basically a series of mechanisms to get the characters to develop the way they want. Still, there are a lot of plot strands that seem to be building to something but are then just left behind in a few episodic seasons of the show."

10.0,16 March 2024,"Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends intense drama, brilliant storytelling, and exceptional character development. Vince Gilligan's creation is a gripping exploration of the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a formidable drug lord. The writing is nothing short of brilliant, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with each episode.

The cast, led by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, delivers performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nuanced and compelling, showcasing his descent into the morally ambiguous world with incredible depth. Paul's Jesse Pinkman is a character that tugs at the heartstrings, eliciting both empathy and admiration.

The cinematography and attention to detail in ""Breaking Bad"" elevate it to cinematic heights. From the breathtaking desert landscapes to the intense close-ups, every frame is meticulously crafted. The show's use of symbolism and foreshadowing adds layers of complexity, making it a joy for both casual viewers and those who appreciate intricate storytelling.

What truly sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its exploration of morality, consequences, and the impact of one's choices. It delves into the gray areas of right and wrong, making it a thought-provoking experience. The character arcs are not only believable but also resonate deeply, making it a show that stays with you long after the credits roll.

In conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" is a triumph in television history. It's a rare gem that combines outstanding performances, impeccable writing, and visual brilliance. Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or character studies, this show is a must-watch that will leave you captivated and emotionally invested from start to finish."
10.0,2 September 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" isn't just a web series; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on television history. Created by Vince Gilligan, this gripping crime drama follows the transformation of Walter White, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston, from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord. From its gripping pilot to its unforgettable conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with its intense storytelling, impeccable acting, and stunning cinematography. Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him multiple Emmy Awards and cementing his status as one of the greatest TV actors of all time."
6.0,20 August 2024,"Breaking Bad isn't just a TV show; it's a cultural phenomenon that redefined the boundaries of what television could achieve. From the very first episode, the series grips you with its intense narrative, intricate character development, and a moral complexity that challenges viewers to question the nature of good and evil.

At its core, Breaking Bad is the tragic transformation of Walter White, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston. Watching Walter evolve from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher into the ruthless drug kingpin, Heisenberg, is a masterclass in storytelling. Cranston's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, balancing vulnerability and menace in a way that feels both deeply human and terrifyingly real.

The supporting cast is equally remarkable. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman is heartbreakingly raw, providing a counterbalance to Walter's descent into darkness. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is one of the most compelling relationships ever depicted on screen, filled with tension, betrayal, and a twisted sense of loyalty.

Vince Gilligan's writing is razor-sharp, weaving together themes of power, greed, and consequence with a plot that is as unpredictable as it is satisfying. The series is filled with unforgettable moments, from jaw-dropping plot twists to intense confrontations that leave you on the edge of your seat. Each episode is meticulously crafted, with every scene serving a purpose, contributing to the show's overarching narrative.

Visually, Breaking Bad is a treat. The cinematography is stunning, making use of the New Mexico landscape to create a visually distinct and memorable aesthetic. The use of color, particularly the symbolic use of green, adds layers of meaning to the story, making every frame feel purposeful and significant.

The show's exploration of moral ambiguity is perhaps its greatest strength. Breaking Bad doesn't offer easy answers; instead, it presents a world where the lines between right and wrong are constantly blurred, forcing viewers to grapple with their own sense of morality. Walter White is neither hero nor villain; he is a complex human being whose actions, though often reprehensible, are driven by a desire we can all understand: the need to provide for his family.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece of modern television. It is a show that will be studied and discussed for years to come, not just for its compelling story, but for its profound exploration of the human condition. Whether you're a fan of crime dramas or simply appreciate great storytelling, Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch."

10.0,9 June 2019,"The pilot was very strong and first episodes promising, but the plot is simply unbelieveble. The actors do a great job, but the story just fails to captivate. Sny real person would be dead or busted half way season 1."
10.0,7 April 2014,"I made it to Episode 6 of season 2.

I am finished now...

As the title says, this is a horrible show full of horrible people, I simply could not connect with any of them, it bums me out after every episode and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, episode 6 of season 2 (Peekaboo) finished me off, I am not prepared to watch things like that if there is no balance (at least there is no balance for me, some people may find the ""lighter"" moments good, but I didn't) The show is just constantly depressing.

The acting is ""ok"" at best, the jokes are not really funny, the drama is annoying and has a ""seen it all before"" feel to it, and all the characters are selfish, miserable, stupid ar$e-holes.

People say this is the best show of all time, hmmm, I don't think so, this is not even in the same league as The Sopranos, and is certainly not as good as: Walking dead, Dexter, Game of Thrones, Mad Men and a few others I could name.

I give it 3 stars because there were one or two moments of decent comedy, and the occasional bit of good writing, but how this stinking turd comprised of human misery rates so high generally is beyond me."
10.0,11 May 2019,"This was Probably the best series I have seen yet. My boyfriend and I actually borrowed the whole series from a friend, and we watched it all within 10 days. It Really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and wanting more."
10.0,5 July 2022,"This show deserves to be treated as one of the best TV shows in the history.

Breaking Bad consists of 5 seasons. Season 1 and 2, although I personally think they are still awesome, can be dragging. However, from season 3, you'll start realizing why the build-up of the show during the first 2 seasons were necessary. If you watched the first 2 seasons and stopped, I would suggest revisiting it.

The plot is awesome. The characters are amazing. The actors make this show feel real. And with all of these, Vince Gilligan uses the most provocative and thrilling concept of drugs, in order to deliver such pure message of morality. Isn't that amazing?

Breaking Bad is not just a simple TV show. This is an experience, that will continue lingering inside you for the rest of your life."

10.0,20 August 2022,"Try as I might, I can't find a single bad thing to say about this show. I put this series off for a long time, writing off all of the praise it got as nothing more than people glorifying a show they liked. But I was wrong. This is one of, if not, the best television series PERIOD. The story, the characters, the cinematography, the ending, and even the humor in an otherwise very serious show is PERFECT. There can only be 1 greatest show of all time, and THIS is that show. I won't give away too much because I STRONGLY recommend going into this show as BLINDLY as possible, but trust me, to the people who stopped watching halfway through the 1st episode because it was slow paced and boring, believe me when I say the 1st episode is MEANT to be slow paced and boring. You can absolutely take my word for it because I was once one of those people who fell into the group of viewers who dropped out early because of the slower paced, almost boring 1st episode. But that's the point. It was most definitely, 100% intentional. The slow paced nature of the 1st episode exists to not only prepare us for the chaos to come, but to give us insight on what the main character, Walter White's life has fallen into. A slow paced and boring monotony. It's not until way later in the 1st episode where the really exciting stuff happens, and that's only at the point when Walt truly starts his dark decent into the drug world.

Every tiny little thing about this show was so carefully planned and thought out, and being slow paced in the beginning is exactly what the creators intended. So with that, take away this.

Enjoy the slow paced nature of that 1st episode, because when Walt begins to break bad, it's only uphill, or should I say downhill from there >:)"
10.0,20 June 2019,The best show ever indeed..........................................
10.0,24 May 2021,Not enough meth. That's pretty much the premise of my review. I wished that there was more action in the episodes because to be quite frank with you there was a lot of filler that I did not enjoy. So more meth.
10.0,11 March 2014,"This show is missing a soul: a beating heart below the surface.

At first glance BB seemed pretty cool to me, but after a while everything started feeling out of place; the funny moments are just uncomfortable. The storyline, which could've been exciting, completely loses all tension within the first episode; quite an achievement! The family scenes with great comic potential never work out because everyone is behaving like psychopaths. I mean, none of the characters in Seinfeld are particularly pleasant and yet they make for good viewing, because they actually respond to their environment in a manner that we can relate to. The violence felt all wrong too. I like my gore (Braindead) as much as the next guy, but it needs to intensify the experience of the story; in BB it's just giving people something to gross out on to prevent them from realizing that nothing important is really happening (Game of Thrones anyone?).

The fact that so many people lose their mind over this show worries me a bit. Then again, I suppose every generation gets the TV show it deserves. We live in confusing times. The good news is that people want to be entertained by something as different as Breaking Bad. The bad news is that what they're excited by is so hollow."

Not a dull moment through out the whole series; I even enjoyed the episodes like ""Fly"". They've built the positive and negative characters so beautifully! I didn't see one character who didn't act well.

The only things that kept me a tad bit disappointed was the ending, it made me feel as if there's going to be another season after the last episode but unfortunately THAT was the last episode!

Not sure if a show like this will be made again, thoroughly enjoyed it!"

Something that will surely keep you glued to the TV while watching, possibly you won't be able to fall asleep because of interest in what will happen in the next episode... First Breaking Bad and after that Soul Goodman; it's much more interesting in that order.

When watching it, it will leave a strong impression on you, and you might even learn a life lesson from the whole story.

Acting is top ten. Tense, unpredictable and wild will simply leave a strong impression on all viewers.

It's a complete and well-rounded series. That's the best part about it, and its continuity is unmatched. When the spin-off series Better Call Saul was released, some of its episodes were even better than Breaking Bad itself.

This show is ahead of its time in terms of cinematography, direction, and acting. Honestly, it impressed me in these aspects. However, the only part that wasn't great was the character of Skyler, Walter's wife. If they had reduced the scenes featuring her, the show would have been even better, just like Better Call Saul."

The music is perfect. In many dark scenes I had cheers. The volume, the timing, the bpm, the quality, the notes. How is it even possible to do so well?

Jesse role is mostly college brat than drug dealer. He dont fit in that role. Walt role cool in first season but later it feels monotonous. I was bored and I am not the only one. when I asked my few friends and they had same opinion.
9.0,27 August 2024,"It was my 2nd favourite show until GoT dropped its last season. This took the supreme position then, quite deservedly.

Initial seasons were a bit slow, but that patience paid off so well in the later seasons. I remember watching its last 2 seasons in the middle of my end semester exams. That was the level of craze it had created for me. Haven's seen a better show yet, even 5 years down the line.

Although a movie based on it came out a few years back which I didn't like much, so I've just ignored its existence.

It will always have a super special place in my heart. BrBa supremacy forever! <3."
10.0,16 February 2024,"Breaking Bad stands as a masterpiece in the realm of television, captivating audiences with its compelling storytelling, complex characters, and intense drama. Vince Gilligan's creation is a rollercoaster of emotions, skillfully exploring the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a formidable force in the drug trade. The meticulous attention to detail, outstanding performances, and unpredictable plot twists contribute to making Breaking Bad a benchmark in the world of television. Its impact on the medium is undeniable.

Simply one of the best series ever made."
10.0,27 November 2023,"Storytelling, character development, and suspense are all areas in which Breaking Bad excels, and the show comes extremely close to achieving perfection in each of these areas. This cinematic masterpiece is a timeless masterpiece that never fails to enchant spectators with its intricately woven narrative and great performances. With each subsequent watching, this cinematic treasure exposes even more depth and complexity, establishing its place as a timeless masterpiece. When compared to the wide landscape of entertainment, this television show is certainly a treasure that sticks out from the crowd."
6.0,4 January 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a gripping masterpiece that unfolds like a Shakespearean tragedy in the modern drug underworld. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine producer, is nothing short of phenomenal. The series, across its five seasons, intricately weaves morality, desperation, and transformation, creating a morally ambiguous narrative that captivates viewers.

Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman is equally compelling, providing a poignant counterpart to Walter's descent into criminality. The writing, laden with unexpected twists and meticulous character development, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.

Vince Gilligan's direction and attention to detail elevate ""Breaking Bad"" to a cinematic experience. The show's visual storytelling and symbolic motifs add layers of depth to its narrative.

The supporting cast, notably Dean Norris as Hank Schrader and Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo Fring, contributes to the show's intensity. The cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and the drug trade is portrayed with nail-biting tension.

Wonderful directing, beautiful acting, the way the characters are transformed is excellent, events escalate very slowly, the soundtrack is very interesting, touching drama, crazy action, scenario.

10.0,29 September 2024,"Breaking Bad is not just a TV show; it's an extraordinary experience that takes storytelling, character development, and tension to levels rarely seen in the entertainment industry. From the first episode to the final heart-stopping scene, the show grips you and doesn't let go, earning its place as a pinnacle of television history. If ever there was a series that deserved more than a perfect score, it's Breaking Bad-11/10, without a doubt.

The Storyline: A Flawless Descent into Darkness At its core, Breaking Bad is about the transformation of Walter White, a meek high school chemistry teacher turned ruthless drug kingpin. The genius of the plot lies in its unpredictability and pacing, perfectly balancing action, suspense, and psychological depth. Each episode builds on the next, constantly raising the stakes and pushing the characters into uncharted moral territory. Every twist feels organic, making the viewer question what they would do in similar circumstances.

What sets Breaking Bad apart from most series is its refusal to drag its narrative. It has a beginning, middle, and an unforgettable end, all delivered without filler episodes. Every plot point serves a purpose, contributing to the inevitable yet shocking downfall of Walter White.

Character Development: Unparalleled Few shows have managed to flesh out their characters as well as Breaking Bad. Walter White's transformation from a desperate man looking to secure his family's future to a cold, calculated criminal mastermind is nothing short of remarkable. Bryan Cranston delivers a once-in-a-lifetime performance, showcasing Walter's internal struggle, his ego, and the moral decay that follows his every decision.

Similarly, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is nothing less than stellar. Jesse's journey from a small-time drug dealer to a tragic figure full of regret and trauma is profoundly moving. His relationship with Walter evolves from mentor-student to one of the most complex dynamics in TV history.

The supporting characters-Saul Goodman, Hank Schrader, Gustavo Fring, and Skyler White-each have their own arcs that are equally compelling. These characters are not merely there to support the plot; they are fully fleshed-out individuals with their own goals, fears, and motivations.

Cinematography and Direction: Artistic Brilliance Visually, Breaking Bad is stunning. The cinematography is nothing short of cinematic excellence. Each shot is meticulously crafted, often filled with symbolism and hidden meanings. Whether it's the sweeping desert landscapes or the intimate, claustrophobic interiors, the setting always complements the emotional undertone of the scene.

Vince Gilligan and his team deserve immense credit for creating a distinct visual language that's both artistic and impactful. The iconic use of color, such as Walter's transformation from light to dark clothing, subtly tracks his moral descent. The use of time-lapse shots, first-person perspectives, and unexpected camera angles makes each scene visually engaging.

Pacing and Tension: Masterful Few shows manage to maintain high tension across multiple seasons like Breaking Bad. Every episode feels essential, each one building towards a larger, inevitable conclusion. The slow-burn style works wonders, particularly in scenes that are quietly intense, like when Walter and Jesse are making meth in the RV while knowing the police are closing in.

Even when the show slows down to explore character emotions or backstories, the tension never dissipates. You're always waiting for the next explosive moment, and Breaking Bad knows exactly how to reward that anticipation.

Iconic Moments and Quotes: Unforgettable Breaking Bad gave us some of the most unforgettable moments in television history. Who could forget ""I am the one who knocks,"" or the tragic fallout of Jane's death? The show is littered with moments that stay with you long after the credits roll, whether it's a tense face-off between Walter and Gus or the slow realization of Hank in the final season.

The writing is sharp, full of memorable quotes, and there's a constant thread of moral complexity running through each character's decisions. The show never spoon-feeds you answers; instead, it leaves you to wrestle with its moral quandaries.

The Final Season: A Perfect Conclusion Breaking Bad concludes in a way few shows ever manage to do-perfectly. Every loose end is tied up in a manner that feels satisfying, rewarding long-time viewers with the closure they deserve. The final episodes are emotional, action-packed, and as dark as they come, providing the ultimate payoff for the journey the audience has been on.

Without giving away spoilers, the ending solidifies Breaking Bad as a series that stayed true to itself, never compromising its vision for the sake of shock value or fan service. It's one of the rare shows where the ending enhances the entire experience rather than diminishing it.

Verdict: A Timeless Masterpiece Breaking Bad is a once-in-a-generation television experience. Its flawless combination of storytelling, character development, and visual artistry makes it not just a show but an immersive, thrilling ride that challenges your perception of good and evil. From its iconic characters to its unforgettable moments, this series will continue to be talked about for years to come.

If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, you're missing out on what is arguably the greatest TV series ever made. This show is not just 11/10-it transcends ratings. It's perfection, and every aspect of it deserves to be celebrated."

10.0,1 November 2013,"This show is highly overrated! It's a good idea. Dull teacher, diagnosed with cancer, wants to leave his family Some money, so he starts cooking meth and becomes a rookie in a criminal world. But the story unfolds so very, very, very slow! There are episodes with no story at all! For example, there is an episode about a fly. A fly in the room where the meth is cooked. And the teacher does anything to get. the fly out, but doesn't succeed. That's the whole story in that episode. Nothing more. And there are many episodes like that. Episodes without a storyline that fits. That's why i can't decide if it is a failed comedy of a failed action series. I only watched it, because my wife liked it very much. It's a soap opera. In the meantime, I did some work and hot it done! So, it has had it's benefits."

10.0,13 August 2024,"I've never experienced a show that feels as meticulously crafted as Breaking Bad. From start to finish, everything in this series seems to have a purpose, and it's evident that a lot of thought went into every detail.

One of the things that stands out to me the most is how well the setting and atmosphere contribute to the overall experience. The way the show uses its environment to mirror the characters' journeys is nothing short of brilliant. The desolate landscapes, the stark lighting-everything serves to enhance the mood and tone of the story.

The characters are another highlight. Each one is so distinct, with personalities that are layered and complex. Watching them evolve throughout the series is a treat; it's rare to see character development handled with such care. I found myself deeply invested in their stories, and it's their authenticity that keeps you hooked from episode to episode.

The music in Breaking Bad is another aspect worth mentioning. While there are other series with more iconic soundtracks, the music here perfectly complements the scenes. It's subtle but effective, adding to the tension and emotion without ever being intrusive. It may not be the most memorable soundtrack, but it's undoubtedly fitting for the series.

If there's one thing I could critique, it's that the show can feel a bit slow at times, especially in the early seasons. But even those moments have a purpose, building the foundation for what's to come. And trust me, the payoff is worth it.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates thoughtful storytelling. It's not just a show; it's an experience that stays with you long after it's over. If there's ever been a series that comes close to perfection, this might just be it."

The show is so boring(no excitement whatsoever) and possibly the most overrated show of all time. Some great acting performances though from the characters Hank, Gus and Saul, but not enough too bring my rating over 2 stars."
7.0,16 July 2022,"This series it's just amazing. The subjects that are addressed in it are done perfectly, in due course. The performances are not even mentioned, one better than the other. Her ending was done at the right time, at the right time, in the right way."
2.0,27 November 2023,"The series centers around Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturing drug dealer. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of White is nothing short of phenomenal, capturing the transformation of a desperate man into a ruthless criminal. Aaron Paul, playing his former student and business partner Jesse Pinkman, delivers a powerful performance, embodying a character filled with conflict and vulnerability.

What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its intricate storytelling and character development. The series is a slow burn, meticulously building tension and complexity with each episode. It explores themes of morality, consequence, and the human capacity for change, often blurring the lines between right and wrong.

The cinematography and visual storytelling are also standout features. The show uses color, camera angles, and symbolism to enhance the narrative, creating a visually captivating experience.

The supporting cast, including characters like Hank Schrader, Skyler White, and Gus Fring, add depth and intrigue to the story. Each character is well-developed, with their own arcs and motivations that intertwine with the main plot.

While the show is intense and sometimes brutally violent, it's balanced with moments of dark humor and irony. This combination keeps the audience engaged and emotionally invested in the characters' journeys.

Overall, ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece of modern television. Its compelling narrative, exceptional acting, and artistic direction make it a must-watch series that has set a high bar for TV dramas.

10.0,6 December 2023,"I never really fell too deeply in love with any show until I watched Breaking Bad. This show is special. The story was just so great, the acting was spectacular, and Vince Gilligan did such an incredible job directing. I've never seen acting as good as Brian Cranston was as Walter White. Every season ended with such a bang. The ending to the entire show was so good. I couldn't pick one thing to change about anything with this show. I even plan on naming my dog Heisenberg. This is truly the greatest show of all time and I don't think I could ever adore a show as much as I did with Breaking Bad."

10.0,20 February 2016,"If there is one show which has absolutely no flaws throughout the series, it has to be Breaking Bad. The show just kept on improving from earlier seasons. 2nd was better than 1st, 3rd than 2nd, 4th than 3rd and 5th was the ultimatum. Nevertheless, all the seasons were just mind blowing. I loved the transformation of Walter White in to Heisenberg. The same guy who thought $737,000 was what enough to support his family after he is gone, even millions couldn't cater his thirst. The scene in which he says ""Just, say my Name"" in S5 just gave me goose bumps even for a second viewing. Each and every character in the series was there for a reason and each of them had their presence felt. That's what is magnificent about the series. Casting is brilliant and acting is top notch. I don't think there is any other actor who could portray Walter White as Bryan Cranston did. Hands down!! I strongly recommend it."

10.0,26 August 2024,"From the very first episode to its unforgettable finale, this show delivers a gripping, edge-of-your-seat experience like no other. The writing is razor-sharp, with every scene serving a purpose and every character meticulously crafted. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of legendary, perfectly capturing the descent from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin.

What truly sets Breaking Bad apart is its attention to detail, from the cinematography to the subtle symbolism sprinkled throughout the series. Every season feels meticulously planned, with plot twists and character developments that feel both shocking and inevitable. Vince Gilligan and his team didn't just create a show-they crafted a narrative that will stand the test of time.

10.0,11 January 2024,"Bryan Cranston's resurgence is here. Once praised for his role in Malcolm In The Middle, he had yet to find a suitable platform for his unique talents. He possesses the rare ability to evoke both sympathy and manic energy simultaneously.

For those quick to dismiss this show as a Weeds imitation, consider that Breaking Bad is an entirely different beast. It delves into the same themes, portraying the realistic struggles of middle-class life in the United States, often leading individuals to extreme measures for survival. Take, for instance, the mother-daughter duo who robbed a bank. However, the weed-selling escapades of Showtime's hit series are nothing like ""Bad."" The pilot episode is as close to perfect as they come, with much of the credit going to Bryan Cranston's performance.

Cranston takes on the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher. He has a loving wife, a child with cerebral palsy, and another on the way. On top of it all, he is battling terminal lung cancer, despite having ""never smoked."" With his finances in disarray, this once brilliant scientist turns to a life of crime to resolve his problems.

He begins producing crystal meth with a former delinquent student. From the very first episode, the show heads towards a dark, yet truthful place. This is a no-nonsense dark comedy.

For fans of Tarantino or the Coen brothers, this may be right up your alley."
10.0,12 September 2024,"**10/10 STARS - THE GREATEST TV SHOW OF ALL TIME**

I just finished binge-watching Breaking Bad, and I'm still reeling from the experience. This show is not just a TV show - it's a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and emotional manipulation. It's a work of art that will leave you breathless, confused, and ultimately, changed.

The show tells the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin.

But don't let that summary fool you - this is not just a show about a guy who cooks meth. It's a complex exploration of morality, family, loyalty, and the human condition.

The writing is superb, with each episode expertly crafted to balance action, suspense, and drama. The characters are multi-dimensional and relatable, with even the most minor players bringing depth and nuance to the story.

But what truly sets Breaking Bad apart is its ability to tackle tough subjects with sensitivity and nuance. The show doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of drug addiction, poverty, and the consequences of one's actions.

I've never seen a TV show that has had such a profound impact on me. Breaking Bad is more than just entertainment - it's an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, stop what you're doing and watch it. Trust me, it's worth it. And if you have seen it, well, then you know exactly why I'm calling it the best TV show ever made."
10.0,10 May 2021,"This show is written so well that I can't argue with someone who declares it's the greatest material written for tv, there's nothing useless in this show every single object is in it's place.

10.0,15 August 2024,"Breaking Bad Is A Work Of Art On Television Breaking Bad is more than just a TV show - it's the pioneer of serialized storytelling as an art form that blew our minds. From its gripping pilot to the explosive finale, it is one of the greatest show for a reason - drama, character progression and thrill at their best.

Plot and Writing: The saga of Walter White's descent from a docile chemistry teacher to criminal overlord is an epic narrative rollercoaster. In fact, creator Vince Gilligan sets up a series of intricate plots and moral calamities which are every bit as unpredictable as they arc dependent; the storylines keep audiences pinned to their seats Every episode is a perfectly structured masterpiece, full of zingers and turns that stay with you after the fade to black. There's a seriously amazing cast.

10.0,1 January 2024,"This was recommended to me by a friend of mine. I never felt like watching it. I first checked it's IMDB ratings etc. And found it surprising that very few have such a good rating.

So now, I had to watch it. When I started it and finished first episode, I never felt like stopping until I had reached the last season and last episode.

Everyday it became a routine like watching 5-6 episodes. I was some serious binge watching watching so to try and finish it as soon as possible and maintain the continuity of entire series.

Even after the end, the season kept looping in my end, the characters, the situations, etc.

I would say everyone to watch it once. (But not with parents/kids together)"
10.0,31 December 2011,"The first season (10/10) is original, interesting and develops the characters nicely, appearing to learn about each other and the industry they're entering.

The second season (5/10) is interesting but the fumbling character dialogue is tiring, the story is predictable and lost it's way from the originality of season one, perhaps I'm looking for The Wire but instead received a damp squid.

The third season (2/10) is slow, boring, off point, ineptitude character scripting and darn right annoying. I often found my self staring at the wall hoping for the episode to end and question why am I still watching this! You are saved by one or two interesting episodes but except to be dramatically let down immediately afterwards.

The fourth season (3/10) is an improvement on the third but still contains underdeveloped characters, do they not learn from their mistakes, is the script/dialogue written by a snail? It moves at the same pace! Bored."
7.0,8 December 2013,"This show is by and far, THE most overrated show I have ever seen. The amount of promoting that is done by fans of the show is unbelievably. At first I chose not to watch, simply because I tend not to sway with popular opinions. Then I decided to give the show a chance given its acclaim...

I was severely disappointed after watching the first season and a little concerned as to why I didn't like (albeit feeling guilty). I then proceeded to watch season 2; I was again disappointed in waiting for the big AH-HAH! moment of greatness. By season 3 I was in physical pain and enraged at everything about this show. I hated the characters, the story line and total lack of orgasmic satisfaction that had been promised by fans.

Like a stubborn mule, I watched the entire series beginning to end; pilot to finale. While I'll choose not to discuss matters pertaining to writing or plot quality, I would like to touch on a few notions categorically:

1) To fans: No, no...this show is NOT as good as or even REMOTELY close to The Sopranos -- please stop dramatically making such drug-induced proclamations.

2) Every character is so damn hatable, it is actually amazing. I hated all-of-them. (yes including the Walter Jr.) I have never felt physical anger towards characters on any show before BB.

3) Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul have amazing chemistry together and I sincerely hope they work together sometime in the future. Despite my hate for their characters, the acting by these two was quite gripping. Beyond a doubt, Cranston especially has proved his abilities to act beyond comedy. He deserves recognition.

After having completely finished the series, I can't help but feel disappointed. I went in expecting a phenomenal show and ended up forcing my self through its entirety. However, I realized that much of this disappointment stems from the brutal constant over-hyping of the series. But I can't say I will ever re-watch the show seeing as how that would be point-less.

So my sincere advice to any potential subscriber to the Breaking Bad series is, stop; don't watch it. Come back in a few months when the hype has completely died and rid yourself of all expectations if only to give your self a fair chance of un-tainted judgement.

I do stand by my original judgement, this series does not belong amongst the likes of The Soprano's. To suggest that this show is better would be asinine."

10.0,22 January 2024,"One the best series I have seen in my entire life!! The production values of ""Breaking Bad"" are consistently top-notch. The meticulous set design, realistic depiction of the methamphetamine production process, and attention to scientific accuracy (thanks to the involvement of a chemistry consultant) contribute to the show's authenticity. The cinematography, particularly in iconic scenes like the ""Breaking Bad"" RV, is both visually striking and narratively impactful. One of the series' greatest strengths lies in its character development. Walter White's evolution is a masterclass in storytelling, as the viewer witnesses his descent into the moral abyss. Cranston's nuanced performance adds depth to the character, making Walter both sympathetic and detestable, creating a complex and unforgettable protagonist."

As the show goes on it keeps getting better, however it also knows when to quit as to not drag on, unlike some other shows. The character develop in new and exciting ways as to not get boring nor static.

While the production of the show isn't no slouch either. The cinematography, editing (especially in the cooking scenes), sound design, and sets all provide for an amazing experience.

Not to mention this show has some of the best acting in TV history. With characters having emotions ranging from neutral to expressive while still being entirely believable.

It is no surprise to anyone that this show is a 10 out of 10. Making it for me the greatest show of all time."
10.0,26 June 2021,Waste of time...First three seasons were fine but after that same thing again and again...ohhh god i wasted many hours on this...ufffff finally over.
7.0,5 March 2015,"I finished the show about 3 weeks ago, and I have to ask... Why does everyone seem to love it so much? In my book, it never came close to leaving a mark on television history. The only reason I finished it is because I was persuaded into doing so.. And admittedly, I was a little curious about how it would end with Aaron Paul's character. Which by the way, is a fantastic actor. And the same thing could be said about the rest of the crew.

So I'm not saying that the acting is bad, neither is the writing. In fact, it's brilliant. The whole concept is brilliant in it's very own way. It had a very realistic touch to it. So I don't blame the actors, I don't blame the writing team or the producers.. I blame this generation!!!

You're not supposed to watch television solely because of the acting or the story.. You're not supposed to watch television because of the realism.. You're supposed to watch it because you want to escape the boring everyday routines that haunts us all, aka real life!!

Despite the brilliance of this show, it was barely entertaining at all. It had some moments that's worth remembering, but overall I found it dull and boring.. Probably the most overrated show of the century. Cheers!"
2.0,7 November 2019,Even better a second time around. Bryan Cranston gives the performance of his career as Walter White and Aaron Paul is exceptional as Jesse. Gripping drama with great humour throughout.
10.0,8 September 2024,"I honestly can't say enough good things about Breaking Bad. From the very first episode, I was hooked. The way the show slowly transforms Walter White from a regular high school teacher to a full-on drug lord is absolutely insane - in the best way possible. Bryan Cranston's acting? Next level. You feel every ounce of his struggle, anger, and ambition.

Then there's Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. His character goes through so much, and Paul's performance makes you feel for him even when he's screwing up. The chemistry (pun intended) between Jesse and Walter is just perfect and keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The writing and direction are top-notch. You can tell everything was thought out down to the smallest detail. The tension builds slowly, but when it hits, it really hits. There's no filler here - every episode matters and adds to the bigger picture.

If you haven't watched Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and start it ASAP. It's intense, emotional, and will definitely leave you thinking about it long after it's over. Hands down, one of the best TV shows ever made."
10.0,29 September 2024,So after long time I watched this webseries and honestly the best web series I ever seen with perfect ending and starting everything was perfect that last 2 episode of breaking bad was just awesome I never expected that would happen every character has best character development I ever seen the Pinkman was my favourite of all time to be honest I liked everyone and enjoying every character but the Pinkman was best that what written skills performed revenge and everything was so satisfying the end of was just perfect I need the greedy of man can destroy you and your family that what they teach it.

THIS IS THE ONLY SHOW WITH A 10/10 REVIEWED EPISODE, like have you ever seen that ? The episode is from ( Season 5 Episode 14 ), man I literally dont know what was I doing with my life ? Like you'll never find a greater show, go to sleep AOT fans, your dada is here."

10.0,29 September 2016,
6.0,10 April 2014,"After I finally finished watching whole five seasons of this series I have to say I have mixed feelings about it. Some things about it I like, some I do not.

Let me start with what I like. I liked characters and acting. Also camera work sometimes was outstanding and there was a lot of twists and turns in the plot. I was impressed by the actor who played White Junior, RJ Mitte, and his character, I was sad that he could not stay in love with his father, but what Walter White character did it is very logical that he had to break with his father. Hovewer, I really liked the sweetness of the character and the actor RJ Mitte. Do not think wrong about all of it, I liked other actors and the work they did, but somehow he jumped out of the ordinary.

What I did not like? I did not like too much violence. I did not like the length of the series. It was just too long. I think 3 seasons would be better then 5. I did not like unrealistic plot. It just was too unrealistic, I do not think that 10 per cent of it would of been possible in the real life. I just do not like that. It seems that New Mexico is not that of a happy state, as far as I can tell from the series and I would probably be not very happy there, or am I wrong?

All in all some of you might like the whole thing, I just did not that much."
5.0,30 April 2015,
10.0,19 July 2021,"""Masterpiece... To be honest, I avoided this series for several years, arguing, 'I'm not ready to see Hal cooking meth.' Big mistake. When I finally decided to watch this TV series, after the first episode, I didn't even remember that character. That's why Bryan Cranston is a magnificent actor, just like his co-stars. This series demonstrates quality from its first to last scene, and that is more than gratifying. The script and main plot evolve into a poetic justice that permeates this legendary story and manages to empathize with characters that are often abject yet infused with so much humanity that it forces us to reassess our morals repeatedly. Like many people, I wish I could erase this series from my memory to experience again the television masterpiece that Vince Gilligan gave us, making us feel as alive as Heisenberg was with his 'baby blue.'"""

10.0,22 February 2023,"Yep, this show deserves the top spot. I reviewed a bunch of episodes as I watched them, but now I want to say that the entire show was FANTASTIC!! Even though it is not my personal favorite show, I have to agree that it is one of the best, if not THE best. Everything just WORKED perfectly. The cast, the acting, the characters, the writing, the story, the themes, the ENDING. I cried and laughed and cheered many times. It brought out so many emotions and questions about humanity. My favorite character was Jesse, but all of the characters were great, even the ones I hated (Todd). Every season got better and better as it went on, which is rare for a show. I think five seasons was the perfect amount, and Felina (the finale) was my favorite episode. Everything from the beginning paid off. Watch the show from beginning to end, you will not be disappointed. It is very violent and intense, so make sure you know what you're going into before watching it, but it's so much more than just two people cooking meth in an RV. AMAZING show! 10/10."

10.0,30 September 2013,"I borrowed Season 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad from a friend after hearing the rave reviews and the 9.5/10 star rating on IMDb. I had high expectations for this show, thinking it would be on par with a show like Dexter. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver.

I watched 10 episodes in total. The entire Season 1 and the first three episodes of Season 2. It just failed to grab me. I felt like the episodes were slow, dragged out ideas that the writers attempted to stretch out for as long as they possibly could. There are hardly any background story lines going on, so you only see the main story line, stretched out so much it's really boring.

Normally after I watch episodes of a new show, I am left with anticipation for the next episode. Like a good book you can't put down. Breaking Bad didn't do this to me. In fact, I was so bored that I stopped Season 2 after three episodes. I couldn't torture myself anymore.

If you're interested in Breaking Bad, I suggest you give it a go. But don't have high expectations because you'll probably be let down."
10.0,12 September 2023,"Breaking Bad may have the greatest cinematography on television and the acting is an astonishing compliment. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Saul Goodman, Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut (the kid named finger), and many more of the characters in Breaking Bad are some of the greatest characters of all time, in movies and television, as a matter of fact, the greatest written characters in the history of stories, in human history, which is an incredible feat.

Breaking Bad is amazingly engaging and is one of the few shows that makes you feel like you are the characters. When it ends, you will want to re-watch it for the rest of your life. Breaking Bad is a show so good that it is the greatest show on television, and it's spin-off show is right behind it."

10.0,6 October 2021,"......after I had finished watching it and it took me some time to concentrate on another series. The problem was that I felt I had just watched the best ever and I was never going to see anything as good again. I still believe that but I've come to terms with it.

I genuinely envy people who have yet to watch it and have that experience to come.

You know when you wish you could unsee something? In this case it would be be because I'd love to see it again.

Having said that I haven't been able to bring myself to watch it again.

It just wouldn't be the same second time around.

I do actually know people who said that they started watching it, didn't like it, and gave up on it, including close family members. I can't comprehend why someone wouldn't like it.

But the series itself is magnificent. Bryan Cranston's Walter journey as Walter White from family man to all consuming narcissist is as subtle and gradual as it is masterful. And the other actors in his universe give powerful performances and only add fuel to his fire.

The show's writer, Vince Gilligan, has consistently stated that there will not be another season which fans kinda understand, considering how the show ended, and they would not want to see the show's legacy tarnished. Having said that there isn't a man, woman or child who wouldn't watch another season on the edge of their seats."
10.0,26 April 2021,And i can understand why its considered the best def better than sopranos.
10.0,5 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is undoubtably one of the most exhilarating, and exciting tv shows of the 21st century.

It's a rare case in a TV series that every season gets progressively better but Vince Gilligans managed to do so in what I consider the epitome Of television.

Each actor played there role superbly in the show, both Aaron Paul (playing Jessie pinkman) and Brian Cranston (Walter White) the leading Actors in the film played there character's so well, it became impossible to claw there performance. Giancarlo Esposito Played Gus Fring in this program in what I consider one of the greatest antagonists brought to screens.

Besides the acting, I was astounded by the camera shots taken throughout the series used along side the careful use of props. It was used effectively to show symbolism and in some cases for shadowing. The writing must also be acknowledged as I can't recall many shows being made with this concept.

There is multiple times I've had to sit up because of the tense scenes that often reoccur. My hats of to the team of Breaking bad creating a show so captivating, emotional and thrilling for the audience. If you haven't seen this piece yet, I highly recommend it to you, because when it comes to TV, this is complete."
7.0,24 April 2021,Very good show 😎 very interesting and good super good plot and stuff.

10.0,14 January 2011,"I started to watch reruns of Breaking Bad because I had never watched it before. How did I not find this show earlier, I don't know. I am proud to say that not many television shows, or even films, handle a concept like this with such amazing depth and great writing.

I remember that whenever Bryan Cranston would win the Emmy award again and again I would seriously wonder what was so great about this man. Of course, things like this always happen. I can say that Cranston is giving one of the best performances to ever hit the small screen. The writers have given him a character that rises and challenges him and he has very admirably risen up to the challenge. He is undeniably powerful. I also want to give a shout out to Aaron Paul, who next to Cranston plays very well and has also risen above to create probably the most unforgettable and sympathetic druggie in a long time. The rest of the supporting cast also is great and are able to handle their characters magnificently well, especially Anna Gunn who has to deal with Cranston's always-erratic behavior.

The direction and writing in the show are top-notch and one is really surprised by how much you care and are involved by the characters. The cinematography is of the quality of an Oscar-winning film, as is the editing and the other technical aspects of the show. I do not see myself ever leaving this show because I know that the writers will never let me or any of the other fans down. Long live Breaking Bad, and AMC for creating some of TV's best stories."
10.0,6 June 2021,"This TV show is so overrated. It has good character development, yes, but it has a lot flaws too. It's just an action movie well told, so cliché."
10.0,27 July 2017,"First time I saw the show it was pretty good. Now, I'm watching it again, and it's kind of painful.

Not sure why, maybe because of familiarity with the characters, or maybe because of something with the suspense. But if you're a Breaking Bad virgin, which is unlikely these days, cheerish your first time."
10.0,28 September 2023,"""Breaking Bad"": A Masterpiece of Modern Television

""Breaking Bad,"" the groundbreaking television series created by Vince Gilligan, is an undisputed masterpiece that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of modern television. Spanning five seasons from 2008 to 2013, this show stands as a testament to exceptional storytelling, character development, and moral complexity. In this review, we will delve into the intricacies that make ""Breaking Bad"" a triumph of the medium.

The show's premise is deceptively simple: Walter White (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future. What begins as a desperate act born out of a dire situation evolves into a compelling exploration of morality, ambition, and the consequences of one's choices.

Central to the show's success is the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered, law-abiding citizen into the ruthless drug lord known as Heisenberg. Cranston's portrayal of this character is nothing short of extraordinary. His nuanced performance captures Walter's descent into the criminal underworld, making the audience both sympathize with and abhor him. Walter's journey forces viewers to question the nature of morality and how far one can go in pursuit of personal goals.

Equally essential to the show's brilliance is the supporting cast. Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman is a revelation, providing the perfect foil to Walter's character. Jesse's moral struggles and growth throughout the series mirror those of the audience, as we witness his attempts to break free from the cycle of crime and addiction. Other standout performances include Giancarlo Esposito as the chilling Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring and Jonathan Banks as the stoic enforcer, Mike Ehrmantraut.

The writing in ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterclass in storytelling. Vince Gilligan and his team craft a narrative that is meticulously plotted, filled with tension, suspense, and unexpected twists. The show consistently challenges viewers' expectations and keeps them on the edge of their seats. Each season builds upon the last, with consequences from earlier actions rippling through the entire series. This attention to detail and continuity sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart from its peers.

The show's exploration of moral ambiguity is one of its defining features. It presents a world where characters constantly grapple with ethical dilemmas, blurring the lines between good and evil. This moral complexity forces viewers to confront uncomfortable questions about their own values and judgments. As we witness Walter's gradual transformation, we are compelled to consider how far we might go when faced with desperate circumstances.

""Breaking Bad"" also excels in its visual storytelling. The cinematography, with its sweeping desert landscapes and stark imagery, adds depth to the narrative. Symbolism is used effectively throughout the series, from the iconic blue meth to recurring motifs like the pink teddy bear. These visual elements serve to enhance the story's impact and underscore its themes.

The show's thematic depth extends beyond morality. It explores themes of family, power, and the American dream. Walter's motivations are rooted in his desire to provide for his family, yet his actions tear that very family apart. The corrupting influence of power is a central theme, as characters are drawn deeper into the criminal world, often with tragic consequences. In the end, ""Breaking Bad"" is a cautionary tale about the pursuit of ambition at any cost.

In conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" is a tour de force in television storytelling. With its outstanding performances, intricate writing, and thought-provoking themes, it has set a high bar for what television can achieve. Vince Gilligan's creation is a testament to the power of the medium to challenge, provoke, and entertain. It remains a cultural touchstone and will undoubtedly be studied and celebrated for generations to come. If you haven't experienced the journey of Walter White and company, it's a journey well worth taking."

10.0,31 May 2019,"The best TV series ever created. Period. I have watched every episode 5 or 6 times and always discover something new with each viewing. This show is the gold standard against which everything else can be measured. In addition to perfect casting, directing, plot, and dialog, we have those magnificent POV camera shots and perfect music. It's been over a decade now, and I still can't believe how good this is. Overwhelming, breathtaking, groundbreaking, inventive, stunning, jaw dropping. Perfection."
10.0,14 August 2019,A great show especially season 4 & 5...started it after watching GOT and it did not disappoint me...
7.0,1 October 2023,"This series is so much more than just television. It's a masterpiece! It's a look into humanity when desperation is the driving force. Regular people turning into who they're meant to be. Honestly it's a show I've watched many times through. The last 8 episodes of season 5 I have watched too many times to count. We're not here to talk about that. This is about some of the most stellar writing EVER. The situations in each episode are just so well done. The way they get out of the situations is nothing short of spectacular! They thought of everything...from watching wardrobes change with attitudes to lighting to camera shots to music. Right down to the last second of the series. So thoughtfully and wonderfully made I swear. And the drama, I mean damn, you'll be on the edge of your seat many times. They ended this series at the perfect time. Although I could've watched it for many more years. Because they didn't wait for it to get stale and stagnant you never have time to get bored. I read years ago that Jessie(Aaron Paul) wasn't supposed to live past a few episodes but the chemistry between him and Walter(Bryan Cranston) was so great they ended up keeping him. Wether this is true or not, I couldn't imagine it any other way! It's just perfection. I will say season 2 is when they flesh the characters out and it's the slowest season but it's still amazing. If you haven't seen this one, it's time! You will not be sorry."
3.0,28 October 2019,"Breaking bad was the second best show of all time, only behind game of thrones. However, the GOT final season was so bad that breaking bad is now on top. I'm rewatching it for the 4th time and honestly love it more and more each time. Never again will you see character development and brilliant writing like this show"
10.0,21 May 2019,Hands down one of the best TV show that has been written and produced so well ! It gets better with every season and every episode !!
10.0,17 February 2019,"Starts VERY well but descends into utter ridiculousness. Walter Sr. is, quite simply, utterly unbelievable as a ""bad guy"", which taints the entire show."
10.0,4 March 2016,"When I read the synopsis a few years ago, already I felt that the storyline lacked interest for me and did not watch any of the series. Then recently some friends were so enthusiastic about the series that I finally got started on it.

So I watched all of episode 1 series 1 and then reflected. Now, it is not as if I am the kind of person who has trouble finding things funny that other people do. But I would say that let's say only half of the material out there that people will find funny will affect me that way. However, this material failed continuously to amuse or excite me in any way except for the suspense of the opening scene not being resolved until late in the episode.

I think of the first episode of a series as the pilot - therefore it sets the level of interest for an entire series. Which meant that after that I simply gave up on the whole series.

So what went wrong? Although jokes are never funny when explained, there exists an anatomy of humour that one can correlate to any given snippet. The general profile of something funny is that it has some element of surprise - it builds up a picture and the moment of laughter is when the viewer or reader is forced suddenly to see things another way. And generally that other way has to have a level of originality for the effect to work.

So I think the problem actually lies in the construction of the screenplay. As much as the ideas appear to be original, they do not unfold in a way that produces the comic effect. Nor therefore is there much occasion of suspense.

So for me the real question is why do so many people find it funny? I think that for me will remain a mystery."
10.0,25 April 2021,"If you watch it once, you want to watch it again. This addictive movie is a very attractive movie that will cross your mind for years."
10.0,2 October 2021,"I've never seen a show that made me feel the same emotions as this show does, with it being very slow at times, this was one of the few shows I've seen that made me enjoy the slowness of it. Amazing show I'd recommend to anyone who wants to see a timeless classic."

10.0,15 September 2023,"Hands down the best series I have ever watched. Just finished it a record 11th time from start to finish, and after the final episode 'Felina' I could quite easily start all over again.

I envy people who haven't watched it yet as you are in for a treat.

Many think it's a slow burner at the start but I struggle to see how, gripped me from the very first scene.

Beautiful work, and I'm only sad that there will never be anymore. Better Call Saul is good, but isn't a patch on Breaking Bad.

Every character is unique, and played by extremely talented actors. The intensity they all bring to the show contribute to its greatness.

Again, cannot stress how amazing Breaking Bad truly is."
6.0,23 May 2020,Out of all the shows that came out from 2008 till now this is the best of them all.
5.0,17 October 2021,
10.0,16 December 2013,"I started watching Breaking Bad when it was quite unknown (in Germany), basically because I finished up another series and looked for a new one to kill some spare time so I was rater impartial and picked it because I enjoyed Brian Cranstons performance in ""Malcom in the Middle"".

But while Breaking Bad became more and more popular through media, I was astonished, that unexpectedly many people started watching this series - which seems rather usual - but in Germany it is a big deal, when a Series, which does not run on TV, nor is available in German language, breaks through to the crowd of people, that are not really interested into movies or series, but only watch stuff that is easy to understand and does not require any previous knowledge on character or story. For example Game of Thrones or The Sopranos, are only known by a ""few"" people that are interested in good series in general, but not by the ones that like so sit on the sofa an just simply consume what is on the screen at that particular moment.

So I asked myself why Breaking Bad attracted so much general interest, while e.g. Game of Thrones did not. Is it the topic, so the the whole drug business thing? Is it the characters that matter? Or was it just a kind of ""happy accident"", that especially this series became so popular? Without a doubt, the writing and the screenplay and just that whole series as such is one of the best ones ever made! But I like to imagine, that people tend to oversee things and in this case those ""things"" are other brilliant series. Being said, that Breaking Bad was the first real drama series that made its way to public audience, it is self-evident that people are blinded by the light of a really good series. Of course the most of the people, that saw Breaking Bad, mentioned it as ""the best series ever made"", but I say that this is the only thing the most people are capable of saying.

What I mean is, that everyone loves Breaking Bad, because there were simply no other series to compare with. If you for the first time eat at a fast food restaurant, it is only natural to say, that ""this was the best burger ever!"", but to determine if it really was the ""best burger ever"" you will have to eat several burgers at several restaurants.

My personal problem is, that you can not claim something for ""the best thing ever"" if you have never seen something like it. I am clearly not willing to say, that you have to know everything about a thing to enjoy it, but the hole swarm of people that glorifies Breaking Bad so badly that you as a big fan start to question the whole series really grinds my gears.

So all in all it is a incredible masterwork and worth admiring, but you should - as always - think twice."
10.0,31 July 2011,"It seems to me that everyone loves this show on here, but I can't be the only one who sees big problems with Breaking Bad. First of all, how can anyone possibly think this show has great writing!? I have to admit that the first season had promise and I thought it could and should get better with the second season, but it turned out I was way off. Every single character is a stereotype! I'll start with the ""bad guys"". Tuco and his cousins? What is that!? Tuco's acting and actions are way over the top to be anywhere close to being believable. As for his cousins.. every time they came on screen, I just wanted to laugh out loud with how ridiculous and cheesy they were(lol at the dragging the axe scenes straight out of a horror B-movie). Gus anyone? Another way over the top stereotype of a business-man/gangster character who you want to punch in the face to get that stupid look off his face. The ""good guys"" are not much better. Starting with Pinkman and his unbelievably stupid actions and arguments with Walt that make absolutely no sense and seem to be put in there to make some sort of suspense between the characters. Although Hank is getting more interesting as the seasons go on, in the first 2 seasons though he was somewhat of a comic relief type with jokes that failed miserably. Now we have Saul replacing him, who's failing even worse. Skyler is just very annoying. Another thing to be seen across the reviews is good acting. I'm sorry I just don't see it, excluding Bryan Cranston/Walter White. Who is the only interesting character that made me watch 3 seasons of this ridiculous over the top storytelling and acting."

Bryan Cranston puts in the finest Lead Actor display as his portrayal of Walter White. I have seen a lot of tv series and nothing tops the acting produced by Bryan. This show was carefully wrote and it does not miss a beat. Every single major part of this story you see , is perfectly constructed to an absolute fine art. Hats off to everyone involved in this masterpiece. I do not think this show will ever be topped. So do yourself a favour and watch this immediately."
7.0,27 April 2021,"8 years after the show finished I still watch sometimes some episodes , repeat some great dialogues for the show and even recommend it to whoever I meet , I have never shaved my head until I watched breaking bad , that Walter character had a big influence in my life specially during a tough period .

A show full of passion , laughs , life lectures , I have to say again and Again thank you to mister gillighan who did all his best to make happy the fans and place this masterpiece in a hall of fame forever in our memories .

The Camino was a sort of desert that every fan wanted to watch but still far from the original show , the spinoff is also excellent it reminds us all the great moment we spend in front of our tv computer waiting for the episodes to be released guessing what could happen to Walter and jesse.

The show wasn't great only because of Walter and Jesse but also skylar marie hank steve gomez beneke crazy8 fring , badger skinny pete Mike of course.

Guys if you haven't seen this show , drop all what you are doing in life and f..... watch it."
4.0,11 January 2017,"Where do I even begin... first of all, Breaking Bad is the best show that will ever be made. I have seen many TV shows in my life, but none are better than this masterpiece. Bryan Cranston gives the best, most realistic acting performance I have ever seen on screen. Not just Cranston, but all the actors in this show are great. Aaron Paul, as Jesse, is phenomenal. Dean Norris as Hank is also a phenomenal character in the show. The plot is also so perfect. High School Chemistry teacher dying of cancer, resorts to cooking methamphetamine to provide money for his family when he's gone. There is not a single flaw in this entire show... the acting is great, the casting is great, the plot is great, the episodes are extremely entertaining, and it will hook you right from the start. I give Breaking Bad a 10, but it deserves a 20. I have watched this whole show twice now, and already want to watch it again. If you haven't experienced Breaking Bad, make it a priority!!!"
10.0,8 August 2022,This series is slow until Season 2 episode 8 and after episode 8 <masterpiece . Do not watch this series first because if you watch first you can't see other series with having fun because any other series not like this masterpiece.
10.0,6 October 2013,"There's no doubt in my mind, that Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows ever!

Great storyline, well written and directed, the actors do a splendid work, great action/adventure/drama, everything is perfect, since the begin of the series until the end, and that's what makes this TV show so addictive.

Sad that's already ended, but I'm very pleased with the end of it, at least I had disclosure!

If you didn't saw it yet, is definitely a ""must see"".

I must say, I will miss this show!

10*Stars"
10.0,7 September 2022,"This is a great show, no denying. The characters are interesting and you care about them (except Skyler). The acting is top tier. The story compelling with even the slower moments holding a certain weight and interest. However, I think it could have skipped a season. Towards the end it suffered from Dexter-syndrom. It felt like it was stretched too thinly towards the wind and I was a bit too keen for the end. I'm very late to the party, but by the train episode, we went from dark humour to just silly filler. Did I like the conclusion... it was okay I guess and just to the characters, but damn I knew there would be spin-off series. That felt forced."
10.0,24 September 2013,
9.0,20 September 2022,"Make sure to watch and finish any shows you are currently watching. Every other show will seem boring and meaningless. Once you watch this show nothing can be better. The drama and tension feel like they actually matter. I haven't really been able to find a show with that kind of impact on your mind.

This is the only show I have ever watched where towards the later seasons you can think back to how he was at first and just feel a weird tension in your brain comparing Walter from season 1 to even 3.

The change is so slight that you can't even tell until you know it's to late. It's so slight it's like filling a pot grain by grain until it's full.

And you will never sympathize for Skyler. If she had been supportive from the beginning I feel as though it would've been very different. But it would have made the show boring but it is what it is."
10.0,1 October 2021,"Perfect on every single level. Character development, storyline, pace, all of it. And absolutely iconic show. The high water mark of television, to this day. It really helped that they had a plan from the beginning on where they wanted to take the show."
10.0,1 December 2021,
10.0,28 September 2023,"Breaking bad is possibly the best show ever created, from it's acting to it's writing. Almost every single aspect of this show amazing and it's great from start to finish. It has action, tragedy, comedy, and even more in every single episode. From season 1-5, it spills with creativity. As mentioned before, it even pulls of comedy in some ways in most episodes. It's characters are so realistic as well; some of the best acting ever seen, likely some of the best acting ever aired on TV. It's so great I would rate it an 11/10 if I could! What the hell are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go watch the damn thing!"
7.0,10 October 2022,
2.0,14 July 2023,"The best TV-series I've ever seen, it reveals the current society , Like a society shrunk and put into film and It exploits the emotions and inner feelings of the characters thoroughly through each part of the movie, giving us a sense of the character's condition at that time. , everything that happens in the movie is very attractive and it attracts viewers, I have watched a lot of TV-series but after watching it many times I still think breaking bad is the best, If you haven't seen it, you won't be able to fully understand what I'm describing , so I recommend everyone to check it out once in their life."
10.0,23 May 2019,"If I have to pick one single best TV Series that would definitely be BREAKING BAD. Every single episode is masterpiece. Even the episode with the fly which many people cannot really understand and I don't blame them. This is one high quality story made in genius way. I recommend it to anyone who like deep, meaningful, emotional stories with many moral cases in them. BREAKING BAD is definitely story I would write a book about, like commentary. The topics in it are contemporary and eternal at the same time. Don't wait, watch it."
10.0,20 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made, and will remain that way for many many years to come.

Amazingly enough it also has a ton of replay value, after watching the show 5 times I still keep entertained the whole way, and discover things I did not see in my initial watch.

The characters are so amazing, and the writing is even better.

A must-watch for anyone."
10.0,16 April 2020,"There are some shows like that... you feel pretty alone not adhering to the unanimous enthusiasm.

It started interesting but lost steam pretty fast and around season 2 or 3 the story started going in circles and resorting to all the tricks writers use when they run out of inspiration, never-ending problems, characters acting like parodies of themselves, any conversation was a shouting contest, heavy doses of annoying drama were introduced, tension was artificially created in a not so subtle way and once in a while the plot was moving forward, occasionally. The last season actually raised the level back up a little, but the previous one felt extremely tedious.

The production quality remained higher than a really low-grade cash-cow week-day afternoon show so it was still watchable without too much fast-forwarding, but the ingredients of a tired idea producers want to squeeze to the last drop are so obvious to me that its unbelievable, passionate success is a true mystery to me. People are not very demanding."
8.0,8 February 2021,My partner raved about this show. I thought it was ok. I got bored half way through but stuck with it as we are trying to actively finish series in 2021. I wouldn't watch it again nor recommend it to someone else.
10.0,24 January 2023,"Every so often a tv show comes around and many consider to be the greatest television show ever. I find myself believing so when I think of Breaking Bad.

I watched this on my friend's recommendation and i loved it. I watched all seasons in just 9 days.

It really is one of those rare TV series that Except one episode(fly) never had a bad episode and a captivating story that kept me watching. A strong cast of actors who put on tremendously great performances and an arc that progresses throughout the series ensured that this would be a classic show.

I can't find any fault with the show, even the least impressive episodes still were engaging and even thought I felt that the 4th Season was superior to the 5th Season, I still thought that the 5th Season was sublime because it shows the downfall of Walter White.

As for the progression of the show? It improved with each season, building on the rise, dominance, and downfall of Walter White. We see him go from a pathetic loser to a drug dealing criminal mastermind and his eventual fall from glory by the final season.

Quintessentially, this is a perfect tv show. No flaws, no issues, and so well composed that even the least interesting episodes are still engaging to watch because the show was planned out with a beginning, middle, and end. Each episode is crucial to the plot and everything is strong.

10/10🔥 A must watch."
10.0,7 February 2023,"The show follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who turns to a life of crime, producing and selling crystal meth, after he is diagnosed with cancer. My favourite aspect of the show is its extremely tight writing, but its complex characters and exceptional performances, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter White are a close second.

I've rated Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10 as it is an absolute marvel of television storytelling that kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The show's combination of humor, drama, and suspense is masterful, and its character development is unparalleled by any show I've ever seen. The show's themes of power, morality, and redemption are explored in such intensive depth, that it makes Breaking Bad not only a thrilling ride, but a thought-provoking meditation on the human condition. If you're a fan of television drama or even television series in general, Breaking Bad is a must-watch series that I believe would leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it."
9.0,22 May 2019,The beat show of all time and the best ending of all time
10.0,19 December 2021,"After hearing about this series from so long from so many people, I finally decided to give it a try and took 2 weeks of leaves from my office , unbelievably I booked a flight and hotel ticket to another state and i literally spent my entire 2 weeks watching this masterpiece just sitting in the hotel ordering pizzas, smoking my stuff, drinking and those 2 weeks of money i spent it was worth every single penny . Trust me it's just not a good show it's an addiction and won't suck even for a single minute . After 2 years Today I have started watching this series again and not at all getting bored. This series kicks harder when you are high specially hope you got me LOL."
7.0,11 January 2022,"I used to think Game of thrones is the greatest show, but after watching Breaking Bad. I was so wrong, nothing beats Breaking Bad.. If you haven't seen this , you've literally missed the greatest tv show of all time."
3.0,17 July 2021,Kudos to the writers. What a show. Best acting by Walter White & Jesse Pinkman. Worth watching to be honest. Great story.
10.0,6 July 2018,This show is written so well. For years I didn't want to watch the show because I thought it was all about drugs but it ended up being my favorite tv show of all time.
10.0,18 June 2019,"I can't say how incredible it is. I didn't know that I'm addicted to BrBa until it ended and then, nothing was good enough to watch."
10.0,18 July 2011,"Breaking Bad is as close to perfection that seems possible. It seems like we have been lead to believe that to have it all is not possible. You can have good writing and poor acting. Great acting supporting a flimsy plot. Great writing and acting but ineffective direction.

This show delivers on everything. The direction has a clear vision and is expertly and artistically executed. The acting from every character is superb, truly superb. The buddy comedy elements are subtle and engaging.

The writing deserves special note. In Shakespeare's tragedies the plot is always a decision or event from which everything organically stems. Every event in the show follows a stream of logic. There is nothing that is dredged forth to progress the plot, it is all the outcome of a few decisions. Breaking Bad is the same. There is no convenient plot devices or deus ex machina. No magic to dig the writers out of a corner like in Lost or characters acting out of character.

I honestly cannot think of a fault in this program. It is truly lightning in a bottle."
10.0,27 March 2020,"Great characters and a great script, if it wasn't so needlessly long. This series could have been reduced by about 50% and been an amazing action packed show. I get it, people love it. For me, it took about one and a half seasons to start getting interesting, kept me relatively engaged until a couple episodes into season 5 - after that, I was ready for it to be over. There are some great scenes all throughout, including season 5, but lordy, it's slow."
10.0,18 August 2020,"I was a late watcher of Game of Thrones, absolutely incredible and rated slightly lower on IMDb than this, so I went into this with high expectations. Cranston's acting and character is really great, but the writing or storylines or whatever it is just had me bored.

Also character Skyler White is extremely annoying. I read articles where Gunn said its 'sexism', but to me that is such a cop out statement and such BS. At first I saw her as the concerned wife, but then it turned into nagging, meddling, and making everything about herself even after Walton revealed his sickness. Then when Walton finally came around and gave her the attention and presence she'd been looking for, she wanted to act like a brat pretending to be so unbothered and uninterested. That is such immature feminine behavior as oppose to handling it all like a real woman, and has nothing to do with sexism. Give me a break. I couldn't help but roll my eyes every time her scenes came up.

Anyway, that's my two cents."
10.0,16 January 2017,"Of course one would have to be living under a rock these past few years to not have heard about Breaking Bad. Many suggested I see it, but the idea to me was absurd to watch a mild mannered science teacher descend into the world of drug dealing, while having his soul wither away. Well, we can all be wrong, and this was a call I missed. What on earth about the above premise could make for good and entertaining television? Everything. The acting, the directing, the writing, and every damn thing associated with this phenomenal show. My husband and I watched this on a ""binge"", the first show we ever did this with. Aside from having to get up for work the next day, we would debate at four am.....""well, one more""? It draws you in, it hooks you, it makes you care. For the ""good"" guys, and the ""bad"" guys. Which, by the way, the lines between get very blurry. I'm waiting a year or so to watch in entirety again. I'm sure there is much I missed. And I'm not the only one I know who says they could not ""shake"" it when the show was over. I actually got a sense of depression! ""No Walter tonight"". ""No Jesse tonight""! Whatever will I do!! In all my years of TV watching, I've never felt that. I even would occasionally relate to a character. Upon exiting my car one morning, someone almost came up on me quickly and cold have hit me. I had to BITE my tongue not to have the words "" Yo! Bitch......."" fly out of my mouth. To finish, Breaking Bad was the most unlikely program I would every imagine I would consider to be hands down the best television show I have ever had the pleasure to watch. And I'm confident I'll enjoy as much, if not more, the second time around. One last note. Some reviews referenced the brilliant soundtrack --which it was. Being a 1960's music aficionado, I almost jumped at the screen when an exquisitely placed ""Crystal Blue Persuasion"" just came out of nowhere. But...that's perfection."
10.0,14 July 2023,"Breaking Bad is undoubtedly one of the most gripping and masterfully crafted television shows of all time. From its captivating storytelling to its impeccable performances, it is an absolute triumph in the world of television.

First and foremost, the writing of Breaking Bad is truly exceptional. The show takes audiences on a thrilling journey that explores the transformation of Walter White, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston, from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord. The character development throughout the series is meticulous and compelling, as we witness Walter's descent into darkness and the moral dilemmas he faces along the way. The writing is consistently sharp, intense, and thought-provoking, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats with each episode.

In addition to the exceptional writing, the performances in Breaking Bad are nothing short of extraordinary. Bryan Cranston delivers a career-defining performance as Walter White, displaying a remarkable range of emotions and creating a character that is both sympathetic and deeply unsettling. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner in crime, is equally mesmerizing, capturing the complexities and vulnerabilities of his character with raw authenticity. The chemistry between Cranston and Paul is palpable, adding another layer of brilliance to the show.

Moreover, Breaking Bad boasts impeccable direction and cinematography. The visuals are stunning, with each shot meticulously composed to enhance the storytelling and create a distinct atmosphere. The use of color symbolism throughout the series is particularly notable, as the shifting color palette reflects the characters' transformations and the moral ambiguity they grapple with.

One of the most commendable aspects of Breaking Bad is its unwavering commitment to realism. The show does not shy away from the harsh realities of the drug trade and the consequences of the characters' actions. It explores the ethical and moral implications of Walter's choices, forcing viewers to confront their own values and beliefs. This commitment to authenticity, combined with its gripping narrative, elevates Breaking Bad to a level of storytelling that is truly exceptional.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Its impeccable writing, exceptional performances, and meticulous attention to detail make it a groundbreaking show that will undoubtedly stand the test of time. Whether you are a fan of intense dramas or simply appreciate outstanding television, Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch."
10.0,20 May 2019,"All time favorite TV series of mine in world. ""I am the Danger"". I am speechless after watching last episode of this TV series."
7.0,28 January 2023,"Series definitely among the best in the world, without any doubt.

Impeccably shot from beginning to end, just the opposite of what usually happens with emblazoned TV series.

It is so noticeable that the series was written all together and that its writing is not dictated by box office. The connections there are between the first and last episodes are noteworthy.

The actors play one better than the other, the director does not miss a beat, the director does not dare beyond what he can do, but what he can do he does perfectly.

A TV series that is probably unrepeatable given today's film economics systems that dictate a lot of the unfolding of TV series, which a breaking bad on the other hand does not exist at all.

The series could have a sequel, which although it would leave its fans embarrassed would collect the millions, but instead it does not come out, it does not come out because breaking bad is not like other series."
5.0,28 July 2019,Best!! So much real content and no exaggeration in events...love it!
8.0,13 May 2019,I dont know what to say but its the best tv show i have ever watched and I'd recommend u to watch it
10.0,17 July 2019,"Story = 10/10

Characters = 10/10

Cinematography = 10/10

Editing = 10/10

Soundtracks = 10/10

Everything just felt like a good dream."
10.0,2 April 2016,"Breaking Bad is just one of those shows that is intelligently written with brilliant acting. Everything about it is top notch. Bryan Cranston who is well known to TV audiences for his role in Malcolm in the Middle is cast against type as anti-hero Walter White. Aaron Paul nails it perfectly as small time criminal Jesse Pinkman.

Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is an overqualified high school chemistry teacher who is struggling to make ends meet with his loving wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and his son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) who has to live with cerebral palsy. When Walter is diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung cancer, Walter must find a way to ensure his family is financially secure after he passes away. Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime by forming an uneasy alliance with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), one of Walter's former students turned small time criminal. Together with Walt's brilliant scientific knowledge and Jesse's street smarts they both start manufacturing and selling a unique ""blue sky"" methamphetamine which proves to be a success in the drug market. Walt must also keep this hidden not only from his family but his brother in law DEA Agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) and his wife Marie (Betsy Brandt) who is also Skyler's sister. Under the pseudonym ""Heisenberg"" Walter transforms from a moral, mild mannered citizen to a ruthless, intimidating criminal.

Bryan Cranston was a true deserved recipient of every accolade and award for his role as Walter White. He was fantastic and without a doubt this will be a very memorable moment for the rest of his career.

Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman was a breakout role for him. Previously known for bit parts in an assortment of movies, Breaking Bad certainly put Aaron Paul on the map. Here he shines alongside Bryan Cranston.

Creator Vince Gilligan who cut his teeth on The X Files has produced a brilliantly intelligent TV series that has never had one dull moment. There's plenty of dark humour, shock moments, mature themes that explore the ugly side of the drug lifestyle, and non-stop moments that will make you smile. The show still retains a lot of realism and believability and nothing is over exaggerated nor over the top in order to entertain and attract viewers. The cinematography was also brilliant and captures not only Walter White and Jesse Pinkman's interactions, but also the supporting characters that hold up the show. Breaking Bad was also well known for being (in)famous for putting Albuquerque, New Mexico well and truly on the map. Albuquerque is also well known for attracting a large number of loyal fans of Breaking Bad with fans spotting Walter's house and Jesse's house as well as certain spots where Breaking Bad was filmed.

Breaking Bad is definitely one of the finest shows of all time and well and truly deserved every single acclaim. Even though the show ran from 2008-2013, there are still many fans of the show that still sing its praises. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul will also be remembered for their best roles of their respective careers.

Breaking Bad is still a pleasure to revisit, and those that have not seen the series yet are missing out on top notch television at its finest.

A well deserved 10/10."
10.0,7 February 2022,
10.0,6 January 2013,"I heard amazing things about the show from friends who are on the latest series right now. so i started looking into the show and seeing what it was like and i read so many good things on IMDb and other review sites saying it was the greatest show ever so naturally i was very excited about it.

So i brought season one and started watching and i even text my friend after episode one saying how amazing it was so i sat there and watched like episodes 1, 2 and 3 all in one go and LOVED it. but then i got onto episode four and i was bored, the show went from being super entertaining to watching a guy on screen doing absolutely nothing. In my opinion the show just went super boring after the mid-way point of series one. However i stayed glued to it, hoping it would pick back up and after eight episodes i decided it wasn't even worth carrying it on. everyone who has heard my opinion have all said the same thing ''you need to wait until series three, that's when it gets really good''. I don't want to wait until a third series of a program before it gets good.

i think what made it much more off a lesser experience for me is that i was watching season 1,2 and 3 of boardwalk and walking dead right before i started watching breaking bad. and i must say that i honestly don't know why breaking bad is so popular when shows like boardwalk and walking dead exist. 5/10."
10.0,16 October 2017,"I have no idea why people like this show. I cannot find a single redeeming trait, not one. The acting is horrible, the characters unlovable, the story-line crap, the directing idiotic, nothing about this show works for me. I have tried to watch it so many times because so many love this show, but honestly the show gets worse for each try I make. Also tried to jump around a bit and check out the most celebrated episodes a couple of extra times, but nah, nothing.

I seldom hand out a one (1), I save those for the worst crap ever made such as The Flash, so I will give this a 2, but that feels too much."
10.0,13 May 2022,"The characters throughout the five seasons are well developed and written consistently building a story that keeps you hooked and plot twists that add to much more thrill, its a must watch and a classic!!"
10.0,13 May 2021,"I have no clue how this show dropped from a 9.5 to a 9.4 but I can guarantee this is the single best show ever created. There isn't a time where an element doesn't work. This show has amazing actors, characters and a story that has many twists and turns but still manages to be believable with the best and most satisfying ending to any show I have ever watched."
7.0,25 May 2019,"Hopefully there will be better series in the future, but not up till now. The GARBAGE that is Game of Thrones season 8 and the way that season ruined the entire series made me appreciate BB all anew. The best series hitherto, easily."
2.0,17 March 2021,"This is a very good show, don't get me wrong... but it's not on par with several HBO shows like ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos""... or even ""Boardwalk Empire""

The main problems I have are that many of the decisions made by the main characters are too illogical... the character arcs go up and down and don't feel realistic... Jesse is by far the worst, it feels like Walt should be alot smarter than he actually is... and the two sisters Marie and Skylar are infuriating.

Then other characters like Hank and Walter Jr. Are well written and feel so much more realistic... in fact that goes for everyone besides Walt, Jesse, Skylar and Marie... they go from inspiring sympathy to absolute hatred from episode to episode.

The best shows on HBO through the years relied on realism and well written characters and the quality difference is enormous from shows on AMC.

A good show, maybe the best show for a cable channel... but this doesn't compare to HBO."
9.0,25 October 2017,"One of the best series to be ever made for TV. This drama made with a calculated budget unlike game of thrones was never boring. Kudos for the great story by Vince Gilligan. By the time i finished the final episode i am spell bound. The camera work, music, editing and what not - everything worked for breaking bad. Walter played by Bryan Cranston will make you feel for him and at times will even turn you bad. He blurs the line between good and bad. The script is so solid that you can hardly find loopholes in any episode. All your feelings, emotions, attitude are brought to life by this guy. Watch the series to understand what it is to be alive. Don't miss this one."
10.0,22 May 2019,"After the last and utterly disappointing season of Game of Thrones it's finally crystal clear that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. Vince Gilligan and the fellow incredible writers of Breaking Bad please save Game of Thrones and team up with HBO to remake the utterly disappointing season 8. We can only dream that much though. Breaking Bad on the contrary with Game of Thrones ended on a very high note that complemented the quality of the previous seasons and even surpassed them. Breaking Bad is a monolithic milestone of television and cinematic art form in general and quite possibly the greatest character study and arc ever presented on the cinematic medium. Breaking Bad serves as an enchanting vignette of sin, the importance of family, power and its corrupting influence, envy and regret, evolution and decay, rise and fall and this seamlessly intertwined amalgamation of brilliant direction, impeccable writing, gorgeous and stylish cinematography, excellent soundtrack, incredible pacing, intricate plotting, captivating story, very extensive thematic depth, rich characterization and exquisite performances put on by its stellar cast, all contribute into making one of the greatest and pieces of cinema ever made with some of the finest characters ever written. With GoT out of the way Breaking Bad solidifies itself as the greatest TV show of all time with the Wire being a close second on my list."
10.0,21 January 2008,
10.0,5 June 2009,"I've never seen anything like this before. These so far two seasons about a man, a father, a husband, a chemical-teacher who gets cancer and start to try out as a drug dealer is a step-by-step-analysis of which consequences this decision can have on your life, family and friends. It's a emotionally roller-coaster ride without big gun shoot-outs or explosions though it shows that many mean things are getting to control your life.

This show doesn't fill every clichéd that is connected to a drug dealer story so it can reach it's sure audience. No! It tries to figure out (and of course it never can be reality, but it's trying to get as close as it can) how to deal with these chliches when they're suddenly entering and ruling your ordinary, normal, average life.

You cannot call this a movie, though you'd like to, because it's the only thing that you can relate to that ever reached such quality. And this is why I don't want to devalue Breaking Bad just to a TV- Series that can be seen randomly on TV. Again: No! It's 15 Hours of high quality. It's 15 Hours of the best thing made out of picture and sound ever made. It's 15 Hours of Art. Art in Directing. Art in Cinematography and especially Art in Writing and Acting.

I love it!"
10.0,29 December 2020,A masterpiece of a serie and without even thinking 10/10.
10.0,21 January 2022,"I although agree that the show is great, and watching it is a fun, yet I do not agree that the story is not unnecessary stretched.

After the season 2, I had to manually skip it to keep my grip. Some episodes like The Fly are absurdly hung around."
10.0,12 October 2012,"As someone who is used to shows being touted as ""life-changing"" and ""brilliant"" I ignored all of the hype about this show until recently, when I saw that there was a museum devoted to art based on this show, not to mention a ""First World Problems"" meme where someone said that Breaking Bad made other television unwatchable. I just had to watch it.

Surprise! It's mediocre.

This is more ""gangster"" entertainment aimed at people who need gangster entertainment as escapist fantasy, but otherwise this isn't any different from other FANTASTIC TV THAT YOU CAN'T MISS that everyone forgets about as soon as it gets canceled."
10.0,11 May 2012,"At the end of season 4 my heart was pounding. Watching Breaking Bad is probably the most physically animated I have ever been whilst watching a TV series (hands over my eyes, laughing, gasping and actually talking at the TV). I have watched many excellent TV programmes, but engaged with this one unlike any other.

With characters that felt so real I thought about them long after credits. It is perfectly paced, beautifully shot, scripted and totally unpredictable.

Breaking Bad is not something I would recommend to everyone, but then this is not a show for the masses. The events unfold with unease, shock and excitement, with intricate and fascinating characters, including dead-behind-the-eyes Gus, and hilarious sham lawyer Saul.

If you are interested in morality, the ambiguity of relationships, have a dark sense of humour, and love a detailed TV series such as The Sopranos and The Wire, I don't need to tell you anymore: Go and watch it. Right now."
7.0,12 August 2020,"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE TV SHOW, PERIOD!

IT'S GREAT FROM BEGINNING TO END! Yes there are couple episodes that felt like might be filler or the ones that they need to do to control the budget(like the one with the fly in the lab), but it also tells a back story about Mr. White!

I've watched it at least 4 times, I kinda lost count! It's just so good, it's scary, it's intense, it's got a good plot. The characters are so well developed and Mr. White is so calculating but you feel his pain of why he did some of the things out of love and some of them out of sins, AGH IT'S AWESOME!

The camera movement, how they shot the story, you can tell they really thought about everything. It's just nicely done on top of the great story!

LOVE IT!"

10.0,20 May 2019,"From season 1 to season 5, Breaking Bad is just perfect all over... Season 4 and 5 are just outstanding! No TV series can ever match the perfection of this show.. mark my words!"
10.0,9 December 2019,"Something like 'Breaking Bad' comes only a few times in a lifetime. It fills you up and when it's done you'll be hungry for more despite it having a perfect ending.

If you watch this show and not feel some type of powerful emotion during it, you might as well jump into a coffin now, because you are dead."
10.0,24 July 2019,"This show is like an amalgamation of the greatest crime movies ever made, without ever feeling or coming across like it's copying from them and separating itself as its own unique thing with a completely original premise. It's like the story of Walter White glides through an anthology of classic crime movies without any lines drawn between which and where they begin or end.

Whether you are a fan of Pulp Fiction, Scarface, The Usual Suspects, Departed, Goodfellas, American Beauty, Heat, even the Terminator and a touch of the Shining, or an ironic list of other famous films of different genres, you will find similar bits, pieces, semblances, as well as homages to them from time to time throughout. But don't expect any one of those films as a whole because this is a totally unique piece of art in itself.

The most entertaining aspect of the show for me was the Business part about it- the way the money is handled and the businesses are created, conducted, and operating are startlingly and impressively realistic in every way into every last detail. The drama, family, relationships, morality, crime genre, dark humor, and character development are all excellent or magnificent, but the realistic way the show handles the business aspect of the show was so impressive and really blew me away. The amount of detail that went into the story construction reveals that the creators did their homework, research, hired experts, and have had their own life experience with entrepreneurship and the business world.

It is also important to the story because it is the main catalyst in the protagonists' profound motivations, which makes so much sense. This also branches off into money laundering and lots of big business meetings and dealings. The hierarchy of who is the boss, who is the helper, employee, partner, investor, associate, competitor, and new hire is perfectly arranged and realistic.

In addition, the protagonist must deal with the growing pains of the business world. Like many entrepreneurs, he succeeds and fails, starts over at times, restructures, learns the ropes, exploits advantages with his product in certain markets, and tries to reach a potential, or at least his goal.

The business aspect is more of an impersonal construct of the show, but it is the character development of not just the protagonist, but several main characters, that are incredibly conceived that is the best person part about the show. When you first meet many of the characters, they seem insignificant, or like they are going to be conventional side characters that only appear on the peripherals from time to time, but you can be surprised who these people really are or how significant they might be.

There are huge surprises, twists, turns, and mindblowing moments along the way, but don't expect them constantly. The show really takes its time in developing the characters, plot, and story- fleshing out its own world in the sunny Albuquerque suburbs and desert area- before it seldom pulls the trigger.

The first season and a half delve heavily into the protagonist's battle with cancer and the affect it has on him and his family, but they also introduce plenty of drama, suspense, action, and surprises. Dark humor is one of the predominant features of this part of the show. If you don't enjoy dark humor, you may find it slow at times, but if you stick with it, you will definitely be rewarded in the later seasons. If you do enjoy the humor, then this will probably become your favorite show.

From late season 2 to the end of season 3, the show begins to turn slightly darker and become far more dramatic. There is family drama, drug drama, and crime drama. Season 4 is stunning and will blow the viewer away with brilliant writing, plot development, plenty of surprises, and nonstop suspense. It is loaded with classic scenes and episodes.

Season 5 is my personal favorite, as there is unbelievably no fat at all in any episode, for the most part, and this is the final season where all loose ends and everything revealed in seasons 1-4 all come back into play and receive closure, which elevates the entire meaning of everything that came before it.

Breaking Bad is wickedly popular among fans, critics, and many top professionals in Hollywood, or the film industry in general. It has influenced, inspired, impacted so many writers, directors, actors, producers, and cinematographers. There are several popular shows and movies that have come out since it aired where you can pick up on direct borrowing and sort of imitating many things that Breaking Bad did on all different levels from story/plot, writing, character development, editing, and overall concept. Some people who have seen shows or films Breaking Bad influenced prior to watching it may not be as affected by some of its brilliance since they are working backward on the timeline.

The acting in it is truly amazing. It probably is the best acted TV series of all time without a doubt. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best acting performances ever, but the supporting cast is almost just as good. Usually, there is a dropoff in tv shows in movies; you'll have one or two great performances, but the rest of the smaller supporting cast is basic and average, but in Breaking Bad, there are truly excellent performances and the roster runs deep. This is the kind of show or movie where even the smallest roles are memorable. There really isn't one bad actor in any part of the series, and that's part of what makes it so good.

Last, I'll mention the dialogue, quotes, and lines. I was not expecting this at all, but this show is loaded with famous lines and dialogue. It all ties back into the script writing, which is brilliant. So many scenes will blow you away with the witty, realistic dialogue and quotes. This is the hallmark of a classic work of film art. It just exceeds expectations for a TV series.

Once you are finished watching this masterpiece, watch it again because there is so much attention to detail that you can't pick up on in your first watch. There are all kinds of foreshadowing, symbolism, references, and little details that will make you appreciate it even more. This is not a show where one watch is enough. It gets better every time you watch it. Also, be sure to learn about the making of it, behind the scenes, the story of how it got made, all the Emmy awards and other awards it won, the records it set, what other prestigious names in Hollywood like Anthony Hopkins said about it, and all of the greatly written articles on it. It will really help you cope with it ending. But a warning: it is so addictive and good that you will probably find it difficult to let go, and every other show in the future will pale in comparison.

If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and experience this once in a lifetime classic. Avoid any spoilers, and it will be ten times as good like it was for me and first time viewers during its airing."
10.0,3 June 2009,"This show is absolutely outstanding! It's quickly become one of my all time favorites, I only remember Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the middle and am fairly shocked by how different he is. He goes from being a completely convincing suburbanite teacher to a completely believable villain without betraying the character. At times he looks completely menacing which is probably what makes the show work because his character really isn't that way.

It's actually a rush at times watching the show because he's so good at sucking you into the world. There's no point in reading reviews for this show, just start watching it, you won't be able to stop."
10.0,5 August 2019,"If I had to characterize Breaking Bad in comparison to other high-quality TV shows, I would call it ""the show that never did anything wrong"". BrBa has a flawless storyarc, which neatly connects the first episode of season 1 with the final episode of season 5. The ending of the series, which has often been the weak point of many other great shows, feels almost inevitable - as many great endings in literature also do.

There is so much to be praised about this show. What impressed me most was perhaps the attention to detail. This is also the show where no loose end was ever forgotten - and, if not tied up, it would usually come back to haunt Walter White or some other character. There is also a strong sense of fate or even karma in this show - at one point literally hitting the protagonist out of the blue sky (if you have seen the show, you understand the reference). Walter White's cancer in the end becomes a metaphor for his own malice, that is slowly metastasizing in his soul. In the end, the philosophical question is whether one becomes bad because of one's deeds (while continuously rationalizing them as necessary and inevitable) or whether one does bad things because it is already part of one's character. The title, ""Breaking Bad"", seems to point towards the latter, whereas the ending of the show rather points towards the former.

The show often uses metaphor and allusion - sometimes in a way that will only be noticed by the most attentive of observers. For example, the curious model of a car Walter drives has been known to be a ""underachiever"" with unrealized potential, much like his owner. Minor details like an unrepaired crack in a windshield or a rotting pizza on a roof are constant reminders of the sinister events that have seeped into the suburban lifestyle - and they are milestones of Walter's moral journey into darkness, until things are beyond repair. Keep in mind that this is the man who feels compelled to ""fix things"" like a random shaky table with a napkin, but who becomes so power-hungry that he eventually declares: ""I'm not in the money business. I'm not in the drug business. I'm in the empire business.""

The psychology of Walter White would lend itself to filling pages, but the same could be said for many other characters. I will never look at harmless hobbies like rock-collecting in the same way again - and the color purple has also gained some unpleasant connotations. I have also learned that a Roomba cannot fix a broken home and childhood.

Perhaps the last piece of praise: the whacky humor of the show. There were moments when I simply did not know whether I should laugh or cry (I will never be able to use an ATM without thinking of this show). BrBa also has it's very unique take on American consumer culture and middle class suburban lifestyle - there is a lot of brilliant social and political commentary in this show (which, by the way, has been further developed in ""Better Call Saul"").

Altogther, this show is a nearly perfect package and incredibly well-crafted. Do not miss out!"

10.0,17 December 2021,"I did really like the series as a whole, but at some point i started wishing something happened to Walt as he became the most annoying and one note character. Jessie (Aaron Paul) saved the show for me with his incredible acting and he became a character i actually cared for. Mike was another character i liked, but in the end didn't care what happened to him. Saul was great.

Anyway. Show is overrated imo. It's good, but there were no scares, no tears and hardly any chills. Saul gave us some good laughs tho.

Good show, not great."
10.0,10 September 2013,"I'm giving Breaking Bad a 5 / 10 because it is an example of superb acting and production quality, but very weak and bland story-telling.

The essence of drama is conflict, and Breaking Bad has had one or two moments in 5 seasons. The problem is that every character is beyond reproach. Without a single likable character, the conflict gets sucked out. You're left without any reason to care about the outcome.

If the main character, Walt, were an anti-hero and the story told the tale of a bad-guy who was trying to escape being caught by the good guys, the show would succeed as compelling drama. The problem is that the good guys are nowhere to be found. Walt's ""nemesis"", his brother in-law Hank, was portrayed in the first season as a power-hungry bully of a cop who loved to toss perpetrators around and verbally assault them. Throughout the series he was utterly vile to his well-meaning wife who wanted to take care of him during an injury, and he has proved himself in later seasons to be every bit as manipulative and dishonest as Walt.

I've watched every episode mostly for lack of anything else to watch, and because it has had a moment or two where the story became compelling (mostly having to do with a drug lord named Gustavo, when the show peaked in my opinion). It is not a bad show, but it does not deserve anywhere near the 9.4 stars it currently has on IMDb.

When every character is a loser who ends up losing in the end, the show becomes reminiscent of a PBS after-school special warning children about the dangers of drugs thinly disguised as drama.

If I were rating the show on acting alone it would get 10 stars. Production value: 10 stars. Writing / story-telling: 1 or 2 stars at best."

5.0,13 October 2017,"""Binge-watching"" a TV series just never occurred to me, ever. I am a busy person, raising my family, working, etc. Who has time to watch that much TV!?? Well, after a few years of certain family members suggesting I tune in to Breaking Bad, my spouse and I decided to do just that.

Thus began several weeks of watching this show every waking moment we weren't working or caring for the youngins', preparing meals, running errands, etc. We sat down to watch one show, and FORCED ourselves to turn off the television at 2am. We could not get enough. We would usher the kids to bed early, when possible, then run to get the computer and settle in to watch ""an episode or two"" on a week night (which turned out to be 4 episodes minimum!); more on the weekends.

In short, you think you are minding your business in your own home, watching a television show...then WWHHHAAAMMM!!!!!!! something you totally did not expect just happens on screen. This was the case with nearly EVERY episode of EVERY season of Breaking Bad. We watched all of the seasons in less than a month.

I cannot imagine a better written, directed, acted, or cast series....I would not watch any for about 18 months after binge-watching Breaking Bad. I figured ""what is the point? what else could POSSIBLY live up!?"" THAT'S how fine this series was. It is graphic, dark, suspenseful, sinister, funny at times...simply amazing in every way. I felt almost like a drug addict watching this show...so addicted to it I was, and trying to hide my obsession with it. Alas, I have moved on and am ""over it"" now, but if you haven't seen it, treat yourself!!!!!!!"

10.0,18 August 2019,In 2030... Son: What is Breaking Bad? Me: Let me tell you the story of greatest tv show ever created...
10.0,8 May 2010,"I'm in my fifties and have watched enough television programs and movies that nearly every fictional story I see is repetitively and transparently predictable. I know how it's going to turn out before the halfway point, because Hollywood just keeps regurgitating the same story lines and scripts ad nauseam. But when I watch Breaking Bad, I find virtually ZERO predictability. I am completely locked-in through every episode because the plot always manages to deviate from the expected. And yet it does so, for the most part, without seriously challenging rational beliefs. I think this show is an absolute masterpiece, and the kind of gem that is too rarely encountered in the garbage-filled thousand-channel morass that is television today. Breaking Bad should be considered the absolute benchmark for serial dramatic programming."
10.0,25 October 2016,"Breaking Bad is one of the best, most memorable and quirkiest shows to air in this day and age. Bryan Cranston plays Walter White, a stressed-out and tetchy school teacher and father of a cerebral-palsy-diagnosed son, who's struggling to keep his family's life secure. On top of that, his wife Skyler White is expecting a baby. His life gets all the more chaotic when he discovers that he has lung cancer, and he won't take sh!t from anyone anymore. Walter teams up with a former pupil of his, Jesse Pinkman, to cook crystal meth and secure his family's future. Walter breaks bad, and he never goes back.

Breaking Bad is the most amazing kind of television show being made; overarching stories and character subtexts that are IMPORTANT in the grand scheme of the series, characters and all. Breaking Bad is hilarious, shocking, and lovingly original take on drug-culture and the thugs living in and around it. The characters are amazing; not just Walter, but Hank Schrader and Saul Goodman are standout characters in themselves, one being a morally-complicated police officer and the other a sleazy but street-smart lawyer. And let's not even get started with Mike Ehrmantraut: the 'clean-up' man of the show who's got his eye on you... and 'Gus'.

Vince Gilligan has cooked the perfect substance: a show so pure and full of powerful beats that many television shows envy it for its genius arcs and subtle character motivations slowly paying off over the course of the show. I'd personally want to shake hands with him and thank him for giving the world such an entertaining and smart show littered with great characters.

Breaking Bad has broken so many barriers in the world of television that all the major networks hoping to emulate the success of this crystal meth gem; and they owe it to Vince Gilligan's black-comedy crime-drama magnum opus.

Watch this show. For television lovers you owe yourself this series, if you haven't seen it already!"
10.0,6 August 2013,"As a convicted cinephile, as someone who loves the 7th art and and treats cinema as a part time job I would never expect to be doing my first IMDb review on a series. Then again, for me, this levels up to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction or even Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather.

This is an astonishing series, by far the best drama ever created by the industry. The pace is absolutely breathtaking, the plot thickens episode after episode and the characters' magnetism is simply extraordinary, as if each of them was ""handcrafted"" to please those who love cinema. Bryan Cranston was apparently not the first choice for the paper but he fits like a glove in the different stages of Walter White. Aaron Paul had to have been a Jesse Pinkman in another life seeing the way he gets inside his own character. Anna Gunn, as Skyler, makes you change your feelings towards her character, from love to hate, numerous times during the series. RJ Mitte turns an ordinary ""it's just the kid"" character into a monumental performance during his 5 seasons as Walter Jr. Also a quick word for Giancarlo ""Gus Fring"" Esposito, bow down ladies and gentlemen for he is, in absence of proper words, splendid.

Do not, in any case, leave this series unseen, you will be missing the most pure (I dare to say beautiful) drama / crime ever. A huge ""Thank You"" to Vince Gilligan for bringing us this amazing methamphetamine rush."
10.0,31 December 2019,"What an emotional rollercoaster. Episode after episode there are moments that hit hard. The characters are so real that you forget they are fictional. The actors aren't acting the characters, they are the character. This is the best TV show ever made and hasn't been surpassed to this day."
10.0,18 December 2020,Sad & funny & serious & smart Vince Gillian makes sure he sprinkles some foreshadowing here and there. it's just good.
10.0,22 April 2020,"I watched this TV-show twice, to be precise probably 1.85 times. Somehow first time I didn't finish it and on the second run was determined to get to the end as a bull pursuing its target. Why? First of all, it is considered to be ""one of the best TV-shows of all times"" and secondly I kind of wanted to finish off what I have started.

I can see why people love the idea. It is so close to reality, meaning the problems with the system in general and the cruelty of the world. The character development is on point and is not straightforward at all.

However, I have a big problem with the show overall. To my personal beliefs there was too much drag, I know a lot of examples where really deep characters were introduced and finished with an immense emotional explosion in a matter of several episodes. In this particular case, I had a huge struggle with getting past 3, even 4 seasons. I don't know why there were so many uncomfortable scenes that I wanted to skip.

I consider the fifth season a real winner, although it had many downs. The ending was powerful and definitely worth watching, the problem is that you need to experience that distorted relationship of main characters to feel it fully.

In the stretch of the show you root for plenty of heroes, you hate them sometimes and then get back those warm feelings. Bryan Cranston really pulled out the big guns and Aaron Paul stood right beside him. This duo indeed is iconic, however, hats off to Dean Norris who outperformed all my expectations and made you interested in his character right to the end. These three are not the only diamonds of the show, but for me - the brightest.

I stay by my word and cannot stress enough that despite all of its intensity, violence, ruthlessness the show is a bit stretched in time. I know many people that could not go further than 2 or 3 seasons and having watched the ending I can say that they have lost quite a bit but I can understand why.

Due to this, I cannot say that this is one of the best TV shows of all the time. It is great, but not the king of the mountain as here it is literally ""through the thorns to the stars""."
7.0,24 January 2021,I think this TV is not deserved to be one of the best ever
5.0,15 July 2020,Love it or hate it you can't put something less than 10 star to this show
10.0,15 July 2016,"Breaking Bad: One of AMC's most successful shows, Breaking Bad is thematically a work of art. A crucial factor in its success is the fresh angle on an anti-hero who is the main character. As an audience, it is fascinating to watch the unearthing of Walter's true personality. The TV show is a modern Macbeth: we see a man overcome by power and lust for his true love; it is a modern Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll is Walter and Hyde is Heisenberg, the one who knocks. What made this show so brilliant for me was the non-traditional approach to shaping the main character: we are so used to having characters that go from bad past to redemption to good (hero's journey plot line). And yet, this show is also a love story: the love of an idea, the thrill of feeling powerful, and feared. It is a story of adventure: a man hiding in the shadows of suburban life steps into the harsh sun light of the American Southwest Desert. Duality of man, in terms of evil and good, is brought into a distinct sublime spotlight, where ""good"" as society sees it is questioned. The theme of personal satisfaction is carefully strung out and analyzed as Skyler, Walter, and Jesse all confront their inner demons while battling outer ones. Breaking Bad is a television classic that cannot be paralleled."
10.0,23 November 2022,"What is there to say that hasn't already. From start to finish it entices you in from the great performances, fascinating storyline, awesome sets and a emotional rollercoaster. Everything just works so well my favourite being the cinematography and the flow just the ability that Vince can just shoot handheld while keeping us focused and engaged is incredible. The flow and edits that don't feel too overwhelming or pointless and make every character arc Interesting for me to ponder about their situations and life. It feels so real, so powerful and it's just a badass film.

Nothing can be compared!"
10.0,23 October 2021,"It just gets better and better. Magnificent in every single aspect. The atmosphere, the cast, the writing. The most memorable and exciting show that I have ever seen. Thoughtful and matchless. Perfection."
10.0,27 December 2020,"There are no words to described Breaking Bad. I have seen many shows and many movies in my life : Godfather, Game of Thrones, Pulp Fiction, Rick and Morty, Shawshank Redemption, LOTR trilogy, The Wire, Sopranos, True Detective, Casablanca, Citizen Kane...

But nothing comes close to Breaking Bad. After watching episode ""Ozymandias"" my mind became clear - that i'm watching the absolute peak of Entertainment (movies, shows, video games).

Breaking Bad is the only thing in existence that's perfect. Sopranos? - had slow pacing and disapointing ending The Wire? Went downhill last seasons, and had few forced characters.

Breaking Bad is an absolute art, telling us the wonderful story of Walter White - a normal Man, turning evil.

Perfect plot, perfect acting, top tier cinematography editing and camera work, brilliant writing and atention to detail, great humor, amazing dialogues with lots of quotable lines, fantastic music that fits every situation they're in, beautiful Way to use colors to tell a story, lots of symbolism and deeper meanings behind everything, amazing character development, original and fascinating plot that keeps you at the edge of the seat through the entire show, perfect pacing and Action, and So many brilliant scenes that they would be impossible to rank. Ozymandias is literaly the greatest, most intense and heartbreaking 48 minutes you Will ever See on your eyes. So if you haven't seen it yet - Do yourself a favor and watching this Masterpiece - but i warn you - YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING THAT COMES CLOSE TO BREAKING BAD.

ALL HAIL THE KING HEISENBERG!"
10.0,26 June 2021,"This might be the best thing I've ever seen... it is 100% the best piece of fiction I've ever seen, but is it the best THING I've ever seen... still deciding. This is the greatest show ever made, and I don't think GOT, The Sopranos, or The Wire will change my mind anytime soon. Every season of this show is gripping and intense, from start to finish. I can't believe I didn't watch this earlier than Feb of 2021. Even though I was too young to see it back when it was on, I still can't believe I watched it this late. I recommend this to anyone who wants to find happiness (or whoever wants to feel all kinds of emotions for that matter) and whoever wants to see one of the biggest and best experiences of their lives."
10.0,10 August 2016,"At first my oral English teacher recommended this TV series. The first several episodes of the first season seems boring and the plot goes slow, showing some very ordinary and simple scenes and actions, but when I continue watching I find myself unable to stop watching... I think the most successful thing of Breaking Bad is that it reveals the complex relationship among people(e.g. between the Walter couple and the Hank family) and the desire of humans. What Walter White wants is not to end his life like a loser(Maybe being a high school teacher is not a bad thing, but what about being laughed at by his students and have no money for cancer treatment? Whatever, he could be so rich if he did not quit that chemistry company.) In the end Walter White says he cooked crystal meth not for his family but for himself. He says he is good at it. I think this may be some kind of self fulfillment. He feels like a accomplished person, a real man. This is really a brilliant TV series I've ever seen."
10.0,26 January 2022,"The best show and end like ever. For me this series i like it more than GOT, and Bryan Cranston act legendary in it. And Aaron paul too i want to thank them and mr.vince."
10.0,16 October 2014,"It's seriously hard to review a show like this when it gets everything so perfectly right in every way imaginable.

All the little nuances from all your favorite movies and shows that gave them that special place in your memory; this show nails them all. Every character gets their deserved depth and importance, every episode has meaning, and every little detail between even the smallest unobserved interaction comes back to play it's part; everything you wish would be put into the perfect movie or show is in Breaking Bad.

The reason it's so hard to review it is because the two halves of every review is, ""What I liked / What I disliked""... but I honestly can't find anything I didn't like about this show! I'm sure you've already read the typical ""acting is top-notch, story is unforgettable, emotion is overwhelming"" reviews from everyone who has seen this show - however - the thing that distinguishes Breaking Bad from literally every other show out there is it's ability to keep you hooked (seriously hooked) into what's happening and what will happen next.

Way too many of even the best shows suffer from a plot that starts off amazing, and then either sticks with it for too long, or takes the bold leap to agree that it's been dragging on and tries to change directions, but doesn't live up to what came before it. Many of those plots remain engaging for many years, but inevitably have to change because the audience either gets comfortable with the direction it's headed; ultimately leading to boredom, or because the plot-device used to push each episode forward has a finite amount of time that it can be dangled in front of audiences before they get fed up with feeling led on; losing it's hold over you as an engaging plot-device.

Breaking Bad takes the story, tension, and character attachment as far as humanly possible, and then changes everything up, while somehow simultaneously satisfying everything leading up to that point and then sucking you back in ten-fold to the new changes as if everything before it was just a warm up. It continues with this always-fresh, always-enthralling story from the very first episode until the supremely satisfying final episode series finale.

One word of warning though; if you haven't seen Breaking Bad, do not (seriously do not) spoil the story for yourself by reading about it online or from friends. Seeing the show unfold on it's own, the way it was presented on-air from AMC, will leave you feeling so satisfied yet always wanting more after every episode.

This is also the only show I've ever given a full 10/10 rating to - because in the true sense of the 10-star rating, you can not possibly score any higher than a perfect 10; thus it should only be given to those truly perfect shows.

Don't just rent or stream it, this is an absolute Must-Buy! You will be so glad you did!"

10.0,8 October 2022,"It's just the best show to ever exist no questions ask. The cinematography to the actual story telling is all 10s. This show can literally change your perspective on how you view life by the acting in this. It is so real. Seeing the character development of each character, some having no development it's all perfect. If I had to say one thing that is actually perfect in the world it would be breaking bad. I honestly see no mistake in one episode, each episode goes by so quick and makes you want to watch more. It's amazing I've seen it 4 times 5 coming soon because every time I watch it it makes me realize how amazing the show is."
10.0,4 June 2021,"I haven't watched many shows, but I can't imagine any show will ever be as good as Breaking Bad. Walt is one of the best characters in tv and movies ever made. His arc from timid, depressed high school chemistry teacher to the biggest meth cook and kingpin in the world is so shocking but somehow feels so natural at the same time. Every move he makes is logical, and you can pinpoint the exact moments where this transformation happens. You never know who to root for. As the show progresses, Walt does some really horrible things, and by the end he is really a villain, and is evil. The other characters are amazing as well. Jesse is just a victim of walts actions, and is forced to do horrible things. Many of walts actions end up harming Jesse much more than him. Gus is a perfect villain, who is so menacing while being so polite. Every role is perfectly acted. The show is full of insane plot twists that you'll never see coming. There are countless iconic scenes, and no bad episodes. Season 5 episode 14 is considered by many to be the greatest episode of tv of all time, and 4x11, 5x16, 3x12, 3x13, 5x8, 3x7, 1x6, 2x12, 2x2, 4x13, 4x10, 5x7, 5x11, and 5x5 are all some of the greatest episodes I've ever seen. The crawl space ending is one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen in any show or movie. Each season is better than the last one, culminating in a perfect conclusion, which is very rare of a show this big. I can't praise this show enough, everybody needs to watch it."

10.0,5 June 2021,"I cannot stress enough how good this show is. If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, simply the greatest."
10.0,22 May 2019,Breaking bad is the best TV show ever. The writing is very good unlike other TV shows that recently ended
10.0,3 July 2016,"I was one of the person who thought this show was overrated while I wasn't yet completed with Breaking Bad. Trust me, patience is all you need till Season 3, Episode 4, after which slowly things will start to gain pace. The initial episodes are slow and thorough to give a clear picture and depth of the family/social situation Walt (the protagonist) goes through. The last episode is worth enough to watch the show completely. It is an awesome show which gives you mixed emotions/impression on the protagonist (Walt).

I say hold on and keep watching it. It is one of the epic stories you will see."
10.0,29 March 2019,First 2 seasons will be little slow..but after that..just awesome..great acting by all..Worth watching and must watch series..
10.0,10 February 2020,"It's perfection. Every other show I'll watch, I'll compare with this subconsciously."
6.0,26 February 2013,"Great, awesome, spectacular. That's 3 words which described those well spent 55 minutes of my day watching this TV show. Let's start with the story: from the second the show starts you are hooked for the first time. And i promise you, it wont be the last. The story engages you from the start due to the amazing rhythm and never lets you go. Even right now I look back to those awesome moments which make this TV show dig into your head and I say ""That was probably the picture perfect definition of a good TV show"". There were so many moments where my jaw just had to drop and my nails were gone. This show teached me that you can never run out of original ideas. I know many good TV shows that start in an engaging season and the next ones just can't live up to the previous. But this show improved by the moment. The actors are fantastic, specially Brian Cranston who is for me the most interesting and bad ass of them all. Aaron Paul and Dean Norris were the other two who stood out. Of course the others were terrific too, like Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte. The same goes to Aaron who makes his character, Jesse a deep and dynamic one. The actors also look like they are cool dudes to hang out with! The mood of the show is quite dark and realistic and sometimes even funny. The story also brings up many philosophies worth thinking about. You can't help but laugh in some scenes that are so messed up but the way that the director portrays them is very humorous. Vince Gilligan does an amazing job of mixing tension, emotion and laughter. Another thing, the soundtrack! Every song fits perfectly with the scene it's in. It pumps you up in such a way I hadn't experienced yet. Oh man, there are so many scenes I'd like to show you which include a bombastic song, but I want to make this spoiler free. In the end this TV show is an example of spectacular acting, directing, editing and plot. All TV shows should take this show as an example and as inspiration. Hail to the king baby!"
3.0,29 September 2019,"A decent show but based on the reviews I expected way more. Pretty predictable, never really left you on the edge of your seat. Has some good characters with interesting arcs at least!"
10.0,12 May 2020,"The acting in this series is really incredible. You will be treated to some of the most compelling and captivating acting around, especially given its overall genre that generally doesn't aim higher than mediocrity. The main cast is beyond excellent and the characters they play are well-written and multifaceted. Even the secondary characters are up there, both in acting and in writing.

The series' main problem lies exactly with the writing, however. Initially, it feels like many episodes not so much develop the characters or the story as simply waste time. Towards the end, many episodes feel like there's not as much a story being developed as a series of excuses for another major character to die in some action-movie setpiece.

But to me much of the series' earlier strength seemed in how grounded both the premise and the plot were, while still being eventful. Killing somebody is difficult and requires disposing of the body; there is no honour among thieves; disarming somebody holding you at gunpoint is laughably impossible for the average Joe. I wish the series had quit while it was ahead and abandoned the weaker, less believable plotlines that began creeping in with Season 3 onwards.

In the end, it's worth a watch, and I don't regret spending time on it, but it's not quite as strong as the rave reviews suggest, in my opinion.

My ratings by season: S1: 5 S2: 5 S3: 4 S4: 5 S5: 5"
10.0,9 April 2016,"I don't know where to begin but let me tell you one thing, I have avoided this series when it first came out and because of my false judgements I am regretful till this very moment. This show is the epitome of gold on TV and not to forget the elegant and far beyond marvellous works of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul who very well deserved the awards that they have received a few years back. Let me sum up this whole review by saying NEVER JUDGE A SERIES BY EYE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE BEAUTY AND EXCELLENCE THAT LIES BEHIND. That is to say that I was unaware of something spectacular and if you haven't watched it yet YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO!!!!"
10.0,1 August 2022,"I watched this 1 year ago. And until this day I just can't get over it. I don't know how to describe that feeling where something is so good that you live in its universe and forget your own life while binge watching it, then once it's over you are like ""wth just happened??"" .. but yeah.. This series is amazing."
10.0,2 April 2016,
10.0,6 August 2022,"I am rewatching this series almost 10 years later when it ended and it still is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The script, acting, direction, storytelling, and character development are excellent. The script is intelligent without being pretentious or overbearing. I have rarely seen any shows that can compare in being consistently strong throughout each season and then just ending gloriously. This series is within top 3 of all time for me."
10.0,25 September 2023,"I remember when this show first came out and I just couldn't help but gush over how good it is, even to my mom... who I knew for a fact would never watch a show about ""this type of stuff."" Anything like The Sopranos or anything related to a show about a drug kingpin just wasn't her cup of tea. With that being said... my mom binged all 62 episodes in under two weeks (a few summers ago). I was astounded.

We both watched ""Better Call Saul"" together shortly afterwards... and enjoyed it just as much.

Breaking Bad (and Better Call Saul too!) really is just one of those shows where you simply forget about the drug part(s). It's more about the human element and how far a person can go... doing what they believe is right... for their family.

Bravo to Vince Gilligan. Obviously not giving much away but, yes. It's THAT good. Relatable, well-written MUST watch TV - of all time."
10.0,28 April 2019,"The perfect TV show doesn't exist. Vince Gilligan: ""Hold my coffee.""

At first I was sceptical about Breaking Bad , because people were so extremely hyped about it. It can't be that good, right? Boy, was I wrong. One of my main concerns was Bryan Cranston. Or as I knew him at the time: Hal from Malcom in the Middle. A TV show I grew up with. I quickly forget his past due to his amazing acting and now know him as Walter White and Heisenberg.

Breaking Bad did many things perfect in it's 5 seasons. Every single actor managed to play their part and nobody slipped up. And the quality never dipped in 5 seasons. I don't know how they did it, but Breaking Bad managed to stay great from beginning to end. And more importantly they went out with a bang. They could've easily dragged the show on for 3 or 4 more seasons and earned way more money, but instead they chose to end Breaking Bad on a high note.

I can recommend this TV show to every single person. Avoid spoilers at all costs if you haven't seen the show and enjoy the ride!"
10.0,11 December 2022,"One of the best TV shows ever made, hands down. In a world filled with 6- 8- and 10-episode streaming miniseries that drop every week like rain from the sky, Breaking Bad is a breath of fresh air. It's cinematography is often focused on long, wide shots of characters that illustrate tension, and make you reflect on what has occurred or might occur. I also loved how each character is given detail and depth. Scenes are never rushed, and time is given for each person involved in Walt's schemes to share that spotlight. Seasons 4 is my favorite, I didn't feel like season 5 was necessary but after watching I can say that it's a deserved victory lap for cast and crew. This is just one of those shows I will forever wish I could re-experience for the first time."
7.0,5 June 2021,"This tv show is one in a lifetime tv show. The best tv show ever.

Writing 10/10 acting 10/10 Plot 10/10 Characters 10/10 breaking bad is BREAKING BAD."
4.0,23 July 2011,"Season 4 just started and did not disappoint.

The intense, visceral expression of this show is unlike anything I have ever seen on TV. The insight into the human mind displayed in ""Breaking Bad"" provides plenty of food for thought, and the entire cast have the ability to bear this huge responsibility on their shoulders and make it believable and engaging. Giancarlo Esposito and Bryan Cranston are in the portrayals of their careers.

It's rare to really be able to say something like this, yet it still sounds like a cliché, but this show just truly contains everything: Great writing, acting and straight up BRILLIANT cinematic execution that spares no expenses on symbolism, intensity and grit.

It's nice that somewhere, someone is keeping it real."
10.0,16 May 2019,The show is nice but it is not 10/10 as people make it..7/10 is more reasonable
10.0,26 December 2015,"Exective summary: Breaking Bad is mildly entertaining.

As someone told me, Breaking Bad is a TV show that would be impossible to stage in Europe. Why? Because the main protagonist would have medical insurance which would cover at least a part of the cost for his treatment.

Apart from this joke, Breaking Bad was vaguely interesting show to me. In a way it was similar to Boardwalk Empire, another acclaimed show that didn't fulfill the expectations and left me mildly satisfied.

What Breaking Bad did well to a certain extent was to show main protagonists's struggle to survive in a new and hostile environment.

On the other hand, all characters were too artificial for my taste, almost like the synthetic drugs produced by Heisenberg. But i guess this was the writers' attempt to portrait ""ordinary people"" in the US."
10.0,30 April 2021,Each season gets better and better. The story unfolds perfectly and the characters are all incredible.
10.0,23 November 2022,"Just such an amazing show. Amazing writing, especially seasons 4 and 5. Legitimately not a boring scene in all of season 5. Some of the best acting I've ever seen, from both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Multiple interesting and intriguing story arches and character development throughout the series. Numerous menacing and thrilling antagonists, and an ever-interesting relationship between Jesse Pinkman and Walter white throughout the show. If you haven't watched anything from the Breaking Bad universe, watch this and then the movie El Camino, and Better Call Saul. Both great pieces of writing."
10.0,15 November 2022,"This show is the proof how mantastic a show can be IF there is a MAN behind it. Vince Giligan is the man and there were not actors really, there were performers. I mean Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and all the other cast performed the act and didn't act. A superb show, a must watch. Period.

10/10 Really Great I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad is able to consistently maintain the engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence, and always achieves the impact it reaches for."
10.0,7 May 2019,"BB and GOT thaught me its not important how u start a Tv series but how well you actually end it. Vince galligan made it sure BB stays the best. BB started slow/boring with its 1st 2 season bt the pace after it was mind blowing and the way it ended was awww-some. Whereas coming to GOT 1st 4 season were 11/10 bt once D&D took over they ruined it. The end was not supposed to meant this way. I am here after the GOTs last seasons 4th episode heart broken after giving these many year to GOT and the end u get its literally disappointing. Had a doubt between BB and GOT which is best so after GOTs season 8, BB for sure remains the best of best series in this world :)"
10.0,14 December 2013,
8.0,4 September 2013,"I'm going to keep this short and concise.. Breaking Bad is the epitome of perfection, a radiant show with just about no flaws. Bryan Cranston's portrayal and development of Walter White is phenomenal; Aaron Paul's performance - impeccable. Some of the other stars of the show aren't as amazing as these two, but they manage to sync into their roles throughout the seasons. The chemistry of the actors in the series is beyond realism, and so this series earns a definite 10 star vote.

The only thing I am afraid of, is that no other series will ever quite keep me on the edge of my seat as Breaking Bad. I will be highly disappointed when this show ends. That is all."
7.0,31 August 2012,"This review is simply an opinion of how I perceive Breaking Bad. Others may not have the same thoughts, but someone out there must agree. I am a reviewer that is normally not interested in television shows in comparison to movies. This is how I feel about Breaking Bad.

Breaking Bad is widely considered the greatest show on television. This would be a sufficient ranking if said before the latest seasons (4,5). This is not to say that the first 3 seasons were below par, but rather that adding season 4,5 to the mix puts the show on another level. Never have I suffered this much waiting between episode showings. Every episode has me on the edge of my seat, and leaves me wanting more and more. Knowing that the 5th season will be its last practically leaves me in tears. I know I am not the only one who feels this way, but I felt the need to write my first review ever about the show that got me interested in television again, and will forever be my personal favorite."
2.0,5 October 2013,"I very rarely write reviews on here as I never feel the need, but I have to say something about Breaking Bad, having just watched the entire 5 seasons. Well, there is no more to be said that hasn't already been said about this show. The only thing that I find disappointing about Breaking Bad is that it hasn't achieved a 10/10 rating on IMDb. I would be very interested to meet the people who can give this show anything less than a 10 rating. I mean, how good can a TV show be? I watched the entire series over a two week period, sometimes not getting to bed until 3am, and not through choice... i really need my sleep. Breaking Bad was my world for those few weeks. This show could be unsurpassable."
10.0,14 December 2020,"Greatest.Show.Ever

Bryan Cranston is just brilliant, Aaron Paul is the best and Giancarlo is chillingly good. Perfect combination of slow and fast paced episodes. Ozymandiaz is the greatest TV episode ever and is just perfect in every way possible.

I wish i could rewatch this show without knowing how incredible it is for the 15th time."
10.0,30 May 2010,"I've started watching this because some people suggested it's the next best thing to Lost, but I was slightly intrigued how big a difference between the quality of the two really is. I'm not saying Breaking Bad is not good, I'm saying it's just not that good. The acting of most lead actors is great, chemistry between them is nothing to complain about, it's just that the show won't nail you to your seat. It goes from fast paced criminal action of Walt killing a drug dealer to long talks of his wife about one boring thing to another. You could basically condense the show to the half of it's runtime without losing any relevant information. It's not that there isn't much going on, it's just that it's a talkie, it's about resolving issues, new issues popping up, resolving some older issues, something happens, resolve some more issues, come to a dead end, resolve other issues. I feel cheated. I was promised a show with a chemistry professor becoming criminal, but I got a show in which as we learn, everybody has issues. It's tough to watch sometimes, so sometimes I skip through bits. Mostly those including Skyler. That shouldn't happen - I never, not in a single episode, skipped bits of Lost.

I would recommend this show to... people who like talk shows like Oprah, who like shows like Sex and the city or Desperate housewives. Breaking bad is packed with dialog and relationship related issues."
10.0,19 January 2020,"Since the show came out I've watched the first season a total of four times. I know so many people that love the show, so I've tried my hardest to get into it. The acting is great and the original storyline is great, I just don't think the show deserves the accolades that it has earned. By the first 3 episodes you've basically gathered the entire gist of the show, and not much changes from start to finish. I've forced myself to watch this show multiple times and I just can't get a feel for it. Love the actors, love the storyline, but the growth of the show and its ability to grab my attention leaves me wondering why this show has the ratings it does. If you're looking for a decent show to consume your time, I recommend it. Past that, the show doesn't really stand out to me."

10.0,29 May 2017,"Saw my headline? Yeah, that's all I can say. Watch it and enjoy the ride. I can watch the entire series again! From episode 1 of season 1 til the very end, it was such a pleasure :) There's a reason the show is so popular. I was sad when i finished it. From a teacher to the great Heisenberg..BITCH!

3.0,1 October 2013,"The greatest show ever created. Perfection in every detail. It's an experience of great cinematographic art and character development. The intensity and drama will ensnare you. Yet the black comedy will make you laugh. This show is all it could be and will stand in history as one of the most amazing TV-series ever made.

And the cast... Never forget the cast. Every actor and actress fills their parts with great success! With the great Bryan Cranston in the role of his life.

The show was perfect, all bad things must come to an end. And what an end.

I bow humbly"
10.0,20 August 2019,"Breaking Bad is and will probably always be one of my absolute favorite shows. Can't really add anything that hasn't already been written by so many other Breaking Bad fans - the character developments, the fine details, the suspense and thrill - I rarely cry during series/movies but I've watched all the seasons four times now and the last episode will forever make me tear up and just feel so many emotions at once. Everytime it's over I always feel so full and empty at the same time.

Then I wait 1-2 years and watch it all again. This show is truly a work of art."
10.0,18 February 2015,"This isn't the worst I have seen but I just couldn't help myself by dropping my two cents. Overall, I think this show is OK, but why such high praises and great reviews? I find the show quite slow and boring, there are so many other shows that are much more interesting than this, are these reviewers on IMDb paid? Really don't get it, this show sucks. Have I been watching a different show than you guys? How can such a boring show be liked by all these reviewers? Please stop watching it, it really does suck, nothing in the show is exciting, it put me to sleep more than once, I even find it difficult to complaint about it using a minimum of ten lines which is required before I can post this."
10.0,21 November 2013,"What exactly is wrong with Breaking Bad? I am not entirely sure. I do feel that I should like the show a lot, it is a good piece of quality television, and yet I'm not feeling it. Maybe it is because of the very slow pace. Something I am normally not at all opposed to, but this is too much. Often I am busy doing other things for 10-15 minutes, and when I return to the series I haven't missed anything important. Maybe it is because none of the characters are in any way likable. Walter is jumping back and forth between a pathetic failure and an emotionless hard-ass drug-lord; Jesse is a pushover who messes up everything he does; Hank is a violent simpleton; Marie is a whiny bitch; Walt Jr. is a superficial cookie-cutter ""coming of age sick kid""; and Skyler must be one of the most obnoxious characters ever seen on television. Maybe it is because of the overall atmosphere of depression and hopelessness. All of the characters' lives are messed up in every possible way, and they all are all lonely, miserable, unfulfilled and doomed to fail. Altogether, this show unfortunately fails to have a grip on me, which is a pity as it is altogether well written and well acted."
10.0,24 May 2019,Should have been one series only as it goes on and on and on. I think it is very overrated.

10.0,8 June 2021,Best series in history i watched it 13 times and never get bored.
10.0,10 March 2016,"""Breaking Bad"" is the best television show. Ever.

We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.

Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature ""yo, bitch""-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.

This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.

The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.

Get on your couch now and start watching ""Breaking Bad"" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene"
10.0,21 August 2020,"I just finished Better Call Saul and went back to rewatch Breaking Bad for a second time. I cannot understate how well written this show is. The scripts are simply incredible. Layers upon layers of great script writing. Deep primal archetypes, set ups, pay offs, reversals, phenomenal dialogue, and characters who are put in jeopardy that have to make smart choices to get themselves out. It's impossible not to root for (and sometimes against) Walter White as he builds a meth empire to provide for his family but slowly turns into a criminal mastermind. I cannot possibly recommend this show enough."
6.0,11 May 2017,"I cannot find words to tell you all how perfect this show is, but all I can say is that there will be none other that can beat this perfect TV show. Breaking Bad deserves all the hype it gets, Vince Gillian truly delivers to the viewers. You will laugh, cry, and your jaw will be dropped to the floor at how shocking it can get. I get how I'm posting this in 2017, but this show will go down in history for being one of the best shows ever. If you haven't seen it, you NEED to see it right now, I can guarantee you that when you finish the show you will NOT regret it. AND, the 3rd to last episode of the series is the only 10/10 to ever make IMDb, so that should explain itself. WATCH IT!"
5.0,7 October 2013,"There are no superlatives left in the English language that have not been showered on this series, it has won almost every award it possibly can and deservedly so.

Bored of the usual drab I started watching Breaking Bad almost from the beginning after reading a favourable review of the pilot. A few episodes later I was telling people this was the best drama I have ever seen. Don't you mean of late I kept getting asked. Erm no, THE BEST EVER!! Ah come on, ER, Sopranos, The Wire etc etc.

2 Years later everybody was on the same page.

With the series drawing to a close I watched the whole series again from the beginning. The astonishing thing is that not only is it as good as I remembered but each and every episode is a classic. Believe me, you cannot sit down and say this is the stand-out episode of the show. At least a dozen of them would get onto any list of the best episode ever.

If you have never watched it, you're an idiot and put it on your bucket list. If you have, watch it again, second time around it's even better because you know what this innocent, mild-mannered teacher is about to become a few seasons down the line!!!"
10.0,1 January 2014,
10.0,15 October 2022,"Breaking Bad has marked forever the tv shows industries, and for good reasons. Insanely good character development, great and well-placed action scenes, an inside look into the mind of a narcissistic, crazy, lost chemistry teacher who has found the thrill of life in being the biggest drug producer of New Mexico. Walter White is terrible, but we root for him, we root so hard for him it's crazy. Gustavo may be one of the most interesting and terrifying antagonists in television history.

Often with Tv shows, the acting isn't the best, often not to movies level. It's not the case for Breaking Bad. It has by far the best acting I've seen in any Tv shows, no one come's close (for the shows that I've watched).

This show marked internet, it marked the world, it marked history."
10.0,2 November 2011,"Breaking Bad is one of those rare TV shows that actually rewards you for watching it. You really do feel like you are being spoiled by it's makers. It has all of the most well known ingredients that we have come to respect in great entertainment and yet doesn't take any of them for granted. Why can't all TV be this good? Breaking Bad has to be the result of both painstaking dedication and pure talent to craft such engaging TV. You'll realize this when you watch it, guaranteed.

One of the more interesting aspects to Breaking Bad is that each episode will reel you in on its own but the background story has been weaved in amongst them and revealed over several SEASONS. Some pieces were still being added in the 4th series and from my viewpoint, the background of Walter (main character) still has points of interest to be revealed. The season 4 finale left me laughing in amazement at how well though-out and clever this show is. Breaking Bad just refuses to grow tired and unable to surprise, season after season.

Hate me for saying it, but I've watched Mad Men, Weeds, Damages, Big Love, The Sopranos, Deadwood ... all of them promised more than they were able to deliver and left you feeling that it either could have done better or promised a similar experience the following season and didn't. Breaking Bad just refuses to let you down in this way and stays interesting on purpose as if there is no option to do otherwise.

Regrettably, there will come a day when this masterpiece of TV will reach it's ultimate ending, however it's also obvious to me that unlike many many series' I have invested in before, Breaking Bad will be allowed to do so in such a way that leaves us rewarded for staying tuned and grateful it was not exploited beyond it's appropriate expiry date."
10.0,29 December 2018,"These series became really popular. I get why, it does explore some themes that are trending nowadays, with envolving characters that really make you want to know what's next in their story.

But after watching it all I think it was not that good, not to be one of the best rated series of the whole story of televison. You get to the point that you starting watching it just form curiosity, but the story itself is really not that good."

The show went really slowly and the plotline didn't really develope. The characters had some development but it wasn't anything revolutionary. I liked the ending and it was well excuted. I was really let down about the show because how over hyped it was. The biggest problem that I have with the show how boring the story is. The plot didn't really move anywhere for a few seasons and there aren't many memorable scenes in the whole show. Also the one thing that bothered me was that how Walter didn't get caught even tho there were already a dozen of people who knew his identity. Some people say that they like the show because it is realistic, but I think it's far from that. For example I found really unrealistic that everything was always somehow connected. It is really unlikely that Walter would meet the same guy who is the father of who his work partners girlfriend and then he would let her die unknowingly of that relation. And that led to the airplanes to crash. And that is also a one thing that bothers me, how the airplane scene was so teased so much but it ended up being non relevant to the story line."
10.0,9 November 2016,"I never believe any hype that claims a TV series is the ""best of all time"", just because my tastes tend to run differently. I do often enjoy some of these ""bests"", I just wouldn't rate them as highly. I didn't think ""The Sopranos"" was the best TV show ever, but I watched the whole thing and I got into it.

And then, there was ""Breaking Bad"". I just don't see it. Whatever it is that all these other people are seeing, I'm completely missing. I thought the first two episodes had some promise, but it failed to develop. I couldn't get with any of the characters, either to love them or to hate them enough to keep watching to see what happened. I wouldn't say my expectations were too high, because I make up my own mind about things and I wasn't familiar with any of the actors, so I really didn't know what to expect. But wow... there just wasn't anything here for me."
10.0,30 September 2013,"10/10 FORSURE! Usually there isn't much you can say about a TV show. Usually it sucks or it's great. But with Breaking Bad, there isn't much you can't say. It's absolutely 100% brilliance. For viewers out there who have never seen an episode of Breaking Bad, be prepared to sit at the edge of your seat throughout the entire 5 seasons. Forsure, there are a lot of TV shows out there, and some too alike. But when watching Breaking Bad, it's a whole new experience. It's almost like it's not even TV its just a really long movie or a real life experience; re told..with a lot more excitement. There is no proper classification for it's genre. Nor is it a drama or a comedy or even a thriller. It's just Breaking Bad. The creators and directors completely broke bad, and changed our entire way of watching TV.

Every person on this earth should have the opportunity to watch Breaking Bad. I am a regular IMDb fan and user, and daily check the ratings of my favorite shows. Breaking Bad being my favorite show, I am always glad to see that it maintains such a good average of 9.4/10. That is phenomenal! Even more glad am I too see that it had spiked to 9.5/10, which is even better! It deserves that...and more! Right now, Breaking Bad is tied with Planet Earth, both at 9.5/10. I hope to see one day, Breaking Bad reach the score of 9.6. It deserves it 100%.

I watch a lot of TV, not because I'm lazy, but because it's so intriguing and I love reviewing and rating the shows. With that said:

Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created.

Thanks to all the producers and directors and especially Vince Gilligan for creating Breaking Bad. Walter White and his fanatic undertaking of the meth industry, will forever be in our hearts!!

10/10 Any day of the week!

HEISENBERG FOR THE WIN!"

6.0,20 January 2014,"The Characters are spot on, story, actors, directing, writing, everything about this show is phenomenally perfect. It's absolutely unpredictable. you simply don't know and won't know what happens next until it actually happens thats how intense and mind-blowing this show is. Before i started watching this show i never really knew Bryan Cranston, i mean i've seen him couple of times here and there but nothing like this. Honestly calling him a Great actor is somewhat of an understatement, the guy is simply Exceptional.

From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. if you haven't watched ""BREAKING BAD"" I suggest you start, because not even ""Game of Thrones"" (which i value and Rank as 2nd in my all time favourite list) is no where near Breaking Bad.

Kudos to Mr Gilligan and everyone involved in creating this masterpiece!!"
3.0,18 May 2020,"I have watched pretty much everything out there and still no show is as good as Breaking Bad. I've watched this series twice, going on three times and still as good as the first time (maybe even better). Give me a thumbs up if you agree nothing beats it."
10.0,28 May 2019,"Fantastic story and character development. Season 1 is a little slow but it pays off. Amazing acting by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, and others. I really recommend this show. Also stop hating on the fly episode, it has great meaning if you dig deep enough.

Also stop comparing BB to GOT. They are completely different shows and you cannot decide which one is better than the other. They are both fantastic shows."
10.0,15 April 2020,"The plot is interesting, but like other good TV series, the difference is the attention to detail. In BB everything is in the right place at the right time. It involves you like a great TV series and is as robust as one of the best movies. 10+"
10.0,1 October 2013,"the BEST TV DRAMA SERIES of ALL TIME Breaking Bad After so many lugubrious turns, ""Breaking Bad"" came to an end on Sunday on an almost uplifting note.

Running since 2008..5 Glorious SEASONS & 62 clinching EPISODES & rating of 9.5/10 on IMDb & 99/100 on Metacritic it ended with the MOST SATISFYING FinalE ever..Watched by 10.3 million viewers.

A simple story of a chemistry teacher making blue meth for providing his family with his former student teaches us every important meaning of LIFE.With very REAL/GREAT/EXTRAORDINARY performance by Bryan Cranston & created by Vince Gilligan this TV Series blowned my MIND..totally.

I have watched so many Great English TV Series like The Walking Dead, Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Supernatural, Firefly & Sherlock also but this was PURE GENIUS.All Hail The King HEISENBERG!!!"

10.0,22 March 2010,
10.0,4 May 2012,"At first, I thought that 'Breaking Bad' went wrong because the drama was played out over too many seasons. The premise of a high-school science teacher who becomes a meth cook had its dramatic elements, but was primarily comic due to the sheer unlikelihood of the situation. As the audience to a drama, we want to identify with the characters, and we can't sympathize with a protagonist who acts without reason. We did have sympathy for Walter White as a cancer patient in a last-ditch effort to leave money for his family. We wanted him to succeed as a meth chef, and we are only willing to consider his moral dilemmas to the extent that we excused his crimes. Breaking Bad should have placed its protagonist in juxtaposing situations involving drug users, like the season-one relationship between Walter and Jesse. The show should have been about Walt considering the effect of his actions and his interactions with people who use drugs. Instead, the writer thought to make a cinematic crime drama, not the episodic, serio-comic look at a teacher, a man in mid-life, and an apparently upright citizen coming to terms with his hypocrisy and accepting others. In season one, Walt has contempt for Jesse, and we hope that this tense relationship continually resolves itself in camaraderie. Instead, the partners in crime hate each other more, and the conflict makes for a ridiculous spectacle as the series lays waste the best aspect of its first season. VInce Gilligan began with 'The Sopranos' before helming this project, and it is easy to see how a plot about the criminal mind of a high school science teacher was derived from the plot about the average suburban life of a mobster. In the latter, we sympathize with a criminal because we see a vulnerable life behind the goombah violence. In Breaking Bad, we lose sympathy with a vulnerable character becoming an egomaniacal criminal and ruining lives. In the Soprano house, there were few household secrets, and no insufferable moments of vile anti-drama when an audience hates the protagonist. The writers here should have allowed Walt to keep his secret throughout the series, which might have ended when his wife found out. Indeed, the initial story wasn't played out long enough. I find it almost unfathomable that five seasons of a show about making drugs might elapse without the main character even considering to try some. At most, the show could have revealed that Walter was associating with odd individuals and possibly using drugs. The series could have portrayed Walt's teenage son in admiration of Walt's young friends, or a wife who disapproved but was led toward consideration. A plausible familial drama would have been one in which a wife disapproves of her husband in a midlife crisis, condescending to youth. If that led to a divorce, the writers could have created ancillary drama about marriage and children. Anna Gunn would have played an estranged wife, not be wasted in the role of a domestic hostage. She fears for her children's safety, totally despises her husband, but never reports him to the police despite having every reason and opportunity to do so. One wishes that Bryan Cranston had found his character as insufferable as it became. This show was ruined by its early notoriety, and a writer encouraged to take himself too seriously. This is still TV, and the novel idea that Breaking Bad was TV art licensed the stupidity and boring suspense that ensued."
10.0,3 February 2023,"I had a hard time starting this show, I tried back in 2015, then in 2019 and never got passed the first 3 episodes. But now in 2023, I finally started it from beginning to end and I can't tell you how stupid I felt and left out when I realized I could have enjoy this masterpiece ages ago! What a brilliant show and nothing can top it. Show this show to the aliens when they ask for our entertainment. The character development is out of this world, those iconic quotes I heard over and over and never could understand. I'm in and I'm in love with this piece of work. Do yourself a favor and WATCH BREAKING BAD!"
10.0,7 August 2022,"The cinematography was brilliant.

Very well written, anything could have happened.

Getting through season 1 is typically why people don't make it to the end of the show but after, you realise it is a needed set up for the rest of the plot."
6.0,4 December 2020,"The greatest tv show of all time, anyone who disagrees is incorrect it's as simple that. Breaking Bad is an absolute masterpiece."

10.0,29 May 2019,"I really felt this show has made me a better person , normally you don't get so emotional and connected to a TV show but this was something else especially the final 3 episodes.This show will always stay with me in my heart and I regret watching it now,should have been done much earlier I don't think anything else can top this show,Vince Gilligan is an absolute genius and thank you for taking me on a roller coaster of a ride of feelings that I can't explain Truly the best"

10.0,25 August 2020,"Incredible TV series. The best thing I've ever seen? Absolutely. The cast, the writing and everything from episode 1 to the final epsiode is fabulous. It's tense, heartbreaking and darkly funny in equal measures. Cranston and Paul are as good as it gets. If you haven't see this, forget what you are watching and move this to the top of your viewing list right now. Awesome."

10.0,15 November 2018,"I watched because everyone said it's THE show to watch, my kids, my friends, critics I respect. Two seasons in and I'm utterly bored. The plot meanders along, most of the characters are utterly unbelievable and do stuff that just does not work. I can't watch any more."
10.0,4 October 2021,I've seen this show 5 times and it is amazing every time. The first viewing was the best experience I've ever had watching a show in my life. Best show ever made and drake and josh only comes close.
6.0,2 January 2021,"Where do I start? Well, simply put the best TV show man has ever created. I've watched allot of brilliant shows over the years, however brilliant is an insult when speaking about Breaking Bad. I even find my self banging my head on the wall sometimes hoping to lose my memory so I can rewatch it (again....) and feel that first-time satisfaction."
2.0,9 January 2022,"This story is unique, Walter White gets cancer and must support his family somehow right? Why not make money the illegal way...

The acting is top notch, the effects are top notch, the story is superb, the characters are memorable and believable.

There is 5 seasons here, 62 episodes total, so its a long story that has to be told, buckle up and get invested because you will love this story.

Every season is a 10/10 for me, everything is believable and well thought out.

My biggest gripe with the show is Walter's wife Skyler, her character arc makes my blood boil, but its totally believable how she treats Walter through out the story."
10.0,23 April 2020,Great show Every season better than the last. Finale is perfect
10.0,15 October 2020,"I don't like this show, I freaking LOVE this show. Best TV series out there, no competition. If you haven't seen this show then I truly envy you. I wish I could erase my memory and experience it all over again. Deserves all of the praise it gets and all of the actors deserve every award they received."
10.0,31 December 2020,"Out of this trainwreck of a year, I did discover one good thing. I had just finished up Narcos when a trailer for Breaking Bad had started playing due to me staying on the ""Related Shows"" screen for too long. I never got the hype at first but I was curious. I hit the play button and it was all she wrote from that point on.

I can talk about how well crafted the writing and how smooth the character development from this show is. I can go on about how beautiful the cinematography is, how it is able to transport us from the beautiful To'halijee desert the the dark mangy backdrop of a meth lab without skipping a beat. I can yap away about how every actor in this series-with series leads' Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, particularly- being a living masterclass in their craft. I can talk you ear off about how this series is as addictive as the meth portrayed in here. But, alas, my words won't do this show any justice, no matter how much praise I give it.

Do yourself a favor and watch this show. You will thank yourself for it. Or you may absolutely regret ever pressing play because you may find yourself completely glued to your T.V. and finding yourself unable to stop watching."
10.0,12 May 2016,"Blood, Meth and Tears If you just found out you had cancer, and only had a few months left to live what would you do? Would you spend every second you could with love ones? Or would you try to complete some sort of bucket list? Would you make sure that your family could survive without your support? Or would you simply give up? These might be some of the thoughts going through your head. However, for Breaking Bad main protagonist Walter white leaving his family to struggle and barely get by is not an option.

Walter Hartwell White is Fifty-year-old man struggling to survive. He works as an overqualified high school chemistry teacher and as a cashier at Bogdan's car wash. He barely makes enough to support his sick son Walt Jr. who suffers from cerebral paisley. He also has to take care of his pregnant wife Skylar, who is unemployed. Not only does he have to worry about his family surviving but also, he just found out he has terminal lung cancer. With only a few months left to live, Walt decides he has to make enough money, so that when he dies, his family will not have to worry financially. He decides that the only way is to start cooking crystal meth. He rekindles an old relationship with one of his old high school student Jesse Pinkman who happened to fail his chemistry class. Jesse is now small drug dealer who is also struggling to get by. With Jesse's connections and Walt's chemistry experience, they decide to partner up and cook the finest meth in the state of New Mexico. With various drug dealers, the cartel, and his stepbrother hank from the DEA after them, how will Walt and Jesse survive and accomplish their goals. Breaking Bad is one of the most critically acclaimed TV series ever made. Which is funny because many of the big TV networks such as HBO, TNT, FX, and Showtime turned down the show according to Wikipedia. Breaking Bad starts somewhat slow at first in my opinion. Well at least for the first couple episodes. But once I got a little deeper in the show my whole view on it changed. The whole concept of the show seemed silly to me, innocent old man, turned into drug lord just does not seem right to me. But the way the director Vince Gilligan progresses the show is just amazing. Also the acting the comes from the characters is just impeccable, there were many scenes in the show that just had my heart pumping wonder what was going to happen next. The show often had me thinking about what would I do if I was in that character's situation. Another reason why Breaking Bad is my all time favorite show is because of the amazing characters. The acting in this show beats any other show I have seen, and I believe they could not have picked a better cast. You have Walter who is willing to do anything for his family and he proves that. Jesse the unpredictable partner with crazy issues. Or the Comedic yet very serious DEA agent/ brother in law Hank who wont give up on finding ""Heisenberg"". Also the unstable wife Skylar who was appealing to many female viewers. One of the characters Saul Goodman a sketchy, shady lawyer who helps Jessie and Walt, was so well liked by fans that he got his own show Better Call Saul. Finally yet importantly Gus, the huge undercover kingpin that is willing to go the extreme to prove a point or get what he wants. The list can go on and on but these are just a few off the top of my head. I personally really enjoyed watching Breaking Bad. No other TV has had me think as much as this one. After watching one episode I would immediately say ""oh I know that blah blah blah is going to die, or ""it is obvious that this and that is going to happen next"" and boy was I always wrong. There are so many complex twist and turns throughout the five seasons of the show and in all honesty, not one episode left me disappointed. Another reason I enjoyed Breaking Bad is because you can really tell how emotionally messed up and distorted each characters is in their own way. It really shows the limit of how much people can put up with. I would recommend this to anyone who loves good TV."

10.0,23 April 2020,The repetitiveness of both the plot and Bryan Cranston's acting mixed with the dull and boring storyline for the last 3 seasons make it easy not to care about the characters. What a shame for a show that began so strongly to end on such a predictable whimper.
10.0,18 June 2021,"Even though story is good, but Walter White character is the worst. He is one of the dumbest person I have even seen. Whenever he took any decisions I thought of slapping his face ."
7.0,10 June 2019,
5.0,4 May 2023,"What sets Breaking Bad apart from other television shows is its incredible writing, direction, and acting. The characters are complex and nuanced, with motivations that are often conflicting and hard to pin down. The plot is meticulously crafted, with each episode building on the last to create a cohesive narrative that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is nothing short of remarkable. He perfectly captures the character's transformation from a meek and mild-mannered teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin, showcasing a range of emotions and motivations that are both compelling and heartbreaking.

The supporting cast is equally strong, with standout performances from Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn as Walter's wife Skyler, and Giancarlo Esposito as the menacing drug lord Gus Fring. The show also boasts some of the best cinematography, editing, and music in television history, creating a unique and immersive viewing experience.

What makes Breaking Bad truly remarkable, however, is its willingness to tackle complex themes such as morality, power, and the consequences of one's actions. The show never shies away from the darkness of its subject matter, but it also manages to find moments of humor, humanity, and redemption amidst the chaos.

In short, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece of television that is sure to stand the test of time. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards your investment, and it deserves a perfect 10 out of 10 rating."
10.0,5 July 2016,"Realizing nothing I can say here will add to what you already have heard endlessly repeated in exhortations undoubtedly more eloquently phrased than I could ever emulate, please indulge what I consider to be my obligation to share something with you that has impacted my life profoundly. I'm not one to use words lightly, and have always been wary of superlatives. I have enjoyed a rewarding life with a family I love very much. They love me back, I'm convinced, but they can't understand how the fictional universe of Breaking Bad has given me an entirely different view of so many aspects of life. The show changed me in ways I'm still discovering; my thought processes seem to trickle through new filters in ways I sometimes find sublime, other times, abhorrent. Almost never dull. I used to try to explain the hows and whys of this to them, but the blank stares evoke pearls before swine, so why bother?

I'm not blind to the potential mental illness that can be inferred by the thoughts I'm writing about. I just don't care. There's a huge kindred that know my feelings precisely, but that's not who I'm hoping reads this. I'm hoping this post reaches *you*, who has read this far into it. Watch this show. Don't think for a minute that it's not something you'd like because it's about a world you're unfamiliar with. The drugs and violence are just where Vince Gilligan hung his hat to sit and tell you what will be the best story you've ever had the pleasure of hearing. I envy you. If I could erase this show from my memory and watch it with virgin eyes... I would sacrifice quite a bit to be that fortunate.

Game Of Thrones is a ten-star show. Breaking Bad goes to eleven, and then some."
10.0,31 July 2022,"We've watched it all the way through. Several times. And I could still watch it again.

Even years later, this is the best show you'll ever watch. Even the ""filler"" episodes are good and well written. Can't say that about any other shows.

This was truly the peak of TV, and things have slowly gone downhill ever since."
10.0,12 December 2019,"I learnt to appreciate BB series even more after I finished watching the first season of GoT. I couldn't push myself to continue to the 2nd season. BB made all other TV shows all so disrespectful to audience.

BB ... You will be missed ... But the legend continues with Better Call Saul"
10.0,30 September 2021,"The best point of the show is the very well written plot which makes you wanna watch it till the very end. The acting also perfect.

And the reality of the plot,because this can very much happen in real life for many people,people do everything for their family...as Walter did.people also do many stupid things as Jesse did... This is one of the shows that I'll never be able to forget. And I have already watched it for a couple of times and I always suggest it to everyone who's looking for a very great show."

10.0,9 November 2021,
10.0,20 July 2020,"It's been a few days but I can still easily remember the cast of Breaking Bad. I felt that the most powerful acting was done by Jesse Pinkman. His dialogues like,"" Hey, Yo! Mister White"" and ""B***h!"" will forever be etched in my mind. His relationship with Heisenberg, how he always felt that he was being used, like he was just a pawn, a means to an end is reinforced throughout the series, and when he finally gets out, the feeling is of liberation, in part quite literally. The relationship between the two is the high point of the series, how Walter considers him to be his son and goes to great lengths to protect him, time and again. His portrayal of transformation of a teacher to a drug lord is praiseworthy. As the series progressed his motivations are shown to change which is true for most people and hence is a very relatable character. The acting of his wife is also good, however I feel that time and again, she was shown in the wrong light. The series is made great by the acting of these three. Honorable mentions include Gus. The plot develops in such a way that the stakes increase every time. However, by the end of the season four you have a fairly good idea about what comes next. Even then the events play out in such a way that they keep you at the edge of your seat. Definitely one for the books, the highlights being the incredible acting and the relationship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman."
10.0,16 January 2021,"It's one of the most boring series I've ever seen except last season which is incredible. But then this series has disappointed me very much. I don't understand how people can love it so much. And I'm not the only one who thinks so because many people I know haven't even managed to finish the first season. Too overrated. I give 6 stars because direction, photography and acting are incredible. (Sorry for my English?)"
6.0,14 July 2020,"Wasted a lot of time on this one just in the hope that it might be good after a few Episodes or after a season. 2 Seasons have passes but no Entertainment, not very humorous. Writing my review after 2 Seasons & don't know if I would any day watch the remaining season. Someone in YouTube placed it on #1 position on Best TV Series of all time. Even checked the ratings but I didn't find I was intrigued to watch even one episode beacuse of the previous Episode. For me it was a waste of time."
3.0,24 April 2024,"I have watched this series for three times and have recommended it to my friends and family- who have all loved it as equally as I did!

I have never explored this genre before and I thought it would bore me to death when I started it. The plot might be slow if you're not into crime films but to me it was just great. The build-up and character development was a masterpiece. You really see the main characters' changes and how they rationalize their decisions.

The show is not hard to digest and tackles about a dying man's need for recognition and how far they would come to satisfy their egos even if it means masking it as a noble act of providing for their family.

This show had me empathize for what people would usually call a villain- but to me was a man consumed by his ambitions. This is the best series I have watched to date and will be hard to top."

10.0,3 October 2022,Just finished this show and this is definitely one of if not the greatest show I've ever seen! The first season is a little slow but after that I couldn't stop watching the acting is so real and believable you can sense the real emotion and you feel like it's real life. The writing is superb as well things are so unpredictable unlike other shows where you kind of know what's going to happen this keeps you intrigued and guessing and shocked. It Just makes you want to find out what happens next. The show is so entertaining only bad thing is that it's over! I'll have to watch Better Call Saul next! Would definitely watch again too.
10.0,7 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is the best series I've ever seen.

I've seen a lot of amazing shows over time, but Breaking Bad is just different. And I mean it's a series that intrigues you in a way that will have you trying to predict what will happen, but being surprised at the last moment. The scenarios, the script and the characters create an atmosphere of tension most of the time that makes you get involved in the situation, and the characters are the most responsible for this.

I could spend hours explaining why each character in the series is perfect, but I think suffice it to say that I could watch a series of mostly minor characters and still be at the level of Walter's story (Proof of this, Better Call Saul).

Without a doubt, it is a series full of emotions, very comparable to a play; We see a character being consumed by his ambition and his own pride and how this leads to success and failure. In addition to showing us how each of the people in the story can be completely opposite and how easy it is to carry a double personality.

There is no way to describe this series in a way that does it justice, but I can say that it is a series that everyone must see before they die."
10.0,5 May 2017,"'Breaking Bad' is the best comedy drama that I've seen recently. The plot was very tightly interwoven, the acting was generally great. It used different angles to show different emotions of the characters, which was wonderful.

What I really liked about the drama is that the way how the boring, over-qualified chemistry teacher turn into an evil Heisenburg. He claimed that all he did was for his family, but actually he did it for himself. I was fascinated to see it. The drama dealt with something in human heart really well. I think the only thing that I felt negative about it was the violent scenes.

I recommend 'Breaking bad' to people who think their lives are boring. I came to realise the importance of an ordinary life and I hope other people might feel the same too."
10.0,14 September 2016,"Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show or movie I have watched to date, and this is coming from a guy who 1) has yet to hook into any other TV show, and 2) has watched a lot of great movies.

The storyline, the directing, the script, the characters, the acting performances and the cinematography are just stunning.

The only blip is probably the second half of Season 5, which I think was too sped up compared to the first 4.5 seasons. That aside, it is still a masterpiece.

Thank you to everyone behind Breaking Bad for making me realise the possibilities of TV shows. It was a privilege to have watched Breaking Bad."
10.0,17 September 2023,"It's really perfect. Walter is one of my favorite character ever, no one can beat him. What about show ? It's not overrated, not underrated, just fairly rated. 10/10, Very good cinematography, direction, and staging of many important moments. Everything is very well thought out. Jesse is a very well thought out character. Vince Gilligan wanted to kill him in season 2, but it's good that he changed his mind. He did a lot for all this. Soul is an underrated and overrated character at the same time. He cannot be ranked higher than Walter, so he is overrated. Underrated - because they think that he is not a top 15 character. Of course, this is supposed to be a review of Breaking Bad, but you all know the positives of this series. Watch it if you haven't watched it, if you've watched it, you'll watch it again."
10.0,7 April 2023,"Im currently watching breaking bad for the 8th time and i am still noticing things that i hadnt noticed before, there are so many plot hints foreshadowing lines/scenes that when you realise, it just makes the show even better. The writing for this show is unbelievable. Casting is perfect.

Simply put this show is the greatest thing ever to appear on a television screen.

The prequal to this show (better call saul) is also brilliant and i hope they dive even further into the breaking bad universe, i would love to see another prequal based on the backstory of gus fring and his time in Chile.

Again a MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE !!!"
8.0,30 July 2012,"I don't get the hype around this show. It's cleaver, it has some interesting moments and the writing is okay, but I don't understand why it gets such a high rating. Cranston is the same character he played in Malcom in the Middle, a middle aged twitchy, ADHD type with a fuzzy grasp on his values and beliefs. The main character sick and dying starts to produce Meth to build a nest egg for his family. The story deals with the inherent risks to him and his family. I find myself waiting for the cancer to win or at least have some impact on his life apart from coughing up blood and the always at an inconvenient time shortness of breath/strength as it only shows up when the poop hits the fan. A pretty lame gimmick for a show that does at times show promise. Not Weeds, not even close."
6.0,14 June 2021,"How this show has gotten so many outstanding reviews makes me wonder, are all those people using Heisenberg's product? I don't see how else. I'm not saying is bad, it is a good serie, but a cry far from amazing. It is boring slow, predictable, inexact even for fiction, to the point that it just gets ridiculous. Thumbs up for the acting, otherwise seriously overrated."
2.0,1 January 2022,"The best TV show in history, in my opinion. With fantastically written characters, suitable twists and turns in storytelling. Rewatchable, addictive, just plain perfection."
9.0,24 April 2021,The greatest series in the history of mankind deserves 100 Emmy Awards all I say about this series is a little bit for him I love this series evaluate the first season 9.0 evaluation season 2 9.1 evaluation of the third season 9.6 evaluation of the fourth season 9.8 evaluation of the fifth season 10.0.

Don't be late just watch it and enjoy."
10.0,31 July 2016,"What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaking to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while. http://www.diziklubu.com"

10.0,7 January 2022,"This is a must watch show. Everything about this series depicts the sometimes harsh reality of society. A man with an average paying job who get's cancer and has no other option but to deal methamphetamine for money to leave for his family when he dies. Acting and screenwritting is above and beyond good, it's outstanding. I highly recommend watching it."
10.0,4 June 2021,"I've watched a lot of TV, movies, etc. But this is the best. You can watch it all. Then few years later (or sooner) you can go back and rewatch it all. It's the gift that keeps on giving. The best TV has to offer."
9.0,15 December 2022,"Oh Man! I have no words to describe how much great of a tv show this is.

This is by far the best show and trust me. I don't watch any show two time but this show made me do it.

This show is the best combination of hate, thrillers, love, family, crime and what not. At first this show might seem boring and slow and nothing happening but don't judge this show on first episodes, it takes time but sure you will get addicted to this after some episodes.

I mean Bryan Cranston's & aron pauls acting is just awesome. Thier acting it to the point. Bryan has really good acting skills and he get in walter white character soo good."
10.0,13 June 2022,"No show can top Breaking Bad. The ones that come close, however, always drop the ball at some point. This show has foresight and planning for character arcs and conclusions that are genuinely impressive--increasing the intensity of the threats and scale of the series every step along the way. By the end, you'll be surprised at how far the show has come. There is not an ounce of weakness in its production quality or acting, just solid execution from start to finish. If you're a fan, definitely check out Better Call Saul: A prequel focused on Saul that has many of the same qualities in terms of dialogue, character development, storytelling, and so on."
6.0,4 October 2020,"Finally got around to watching it. It's okay. I didn't care for the hype at the time, and now I find it a bit surprising why the hype was there at all. I would rate other series, like The Sopranos for example, much more highly."
2.0,21 August 2016,"See at the bottom for explanation on strangely spelled words;

This story starts off with some potential interesting plots and continues with some potential angles and plots. But sadly nearly all of what goes on - i.e. makes out the content of the series is based on an increasing stupidity ! Yes, stupidity! The main character who is supposedly a 'very smart chemist' and more, eventually fails to make any planning ahead. He has no ability to voice himself. And so on and so on. It is even a surprise that he is able to buy a hamburger at Macnudles, or take a p iss... It is just so annoying how everything he does fails because he is to stupid to do anything and this creates 'entertainment'.. Well, there's one slight exception; There are some parts - I call them parts - that are cut into the action that does not belong to any part of the main story at all - like parts of some other movies were accidentally put random in to this series. But again and again and again and again I have to watch one of the stupidest of men who initially were portrayed to have an IQ above (yes above) 50.... It becomes so annoying to look at all this stupidity - almost like me repeating myself now (only 1000 times worse). From another IMDb User: IMDb - you clowns. don't tell me there are prohibited words without telling me what the hell they are you time wasting goofs. For everyone else reading this. ""P i ss ed"" is a prohibited word. Can you believe this fuking sht? --- End Other User."
10.0,7 October 2021,"Breaking Bad is the best TV show I've ever seen. It began with an incredible opening shot and the cinematography was spectacular. The character transformation of Walter White is binge worthy. Being an underachieving high school Chemistry teacher to the drug emperor Heisenberg.. The other characters are so well developed. I feel like I really know them. Actually Walter White's focus wasn't meth, he loves chemistry. Throughout the series, he is a true genius. He has an incredible read on people and wise decision making capacity. But magnificence couldn't come from the absence of mistakes. Exactly the opposite some bad decisions Walter white made were the touchstones to create unforgettable and realistic tv character. What makes the series the greatest art for me is the feeling that nothing could be different..

""I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really.. I was alive!"""
10.0,8 January 2023,"I have watched it 3 times already, once when it was first released first season, they broadcasted it on TV in my native language, they had translated it like : ""In the shoes of Satan"" ( BG: ""V obuvkite na satanata"") i was curious then, why was that, when everywhere was ""Breaking Bad"", but then i was a kid, so i didn't actually get that. When i grew up, i realised that there must be more seasons, that was like 10 years ago, i watched it and i was extremely mindblown, this thing is a real masterpiece, i would love to see more, but unfortunately, there won't be.. Everyone who still hasn't watched it, just go and watch it right now !"
10.0,17 August 2022,"Although it may seem slow, its narrative from the beginning proves to be something much more than we imagine, leading us to question ourselves what we would do in these situations.

It's a complete series, with complete characters, and with a complete ending, perfect in every way."
10.0,7 August 2022,"One of the best series I have ever watched . I am truly lucky that I continued the series after season 1 , because it was very slow in my opinion. Amazing acting by Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn , Giancarlo Esposito and Aaron Paul . I suggest it to all the people who have a hesitation about it because of the high number of 62 episodes . My rating of the seasons : Season 1 : 6.5/10 Season 2 : 8.5/10 Season 3 : 9.5/10 Season 4 : 10/10 Season 5 : 100/10."
10.0,9 April 2016,"Well, What can I say about this amazing TV series? It is just the best series I have ever seen. I miss Walter White and Jesse Pinkman...

The first season is really good, because Walter is worried about his life and what he is going to do after the news about the cancer.

The second and third seasons they keep very good, but I think that the fact of Walter want to forget the idea to cook meth and turn back all the time is a little tiring...

The fourth season is probably the most moment awaited of all the series. Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring made a great performance and he really looks like a two-faces man. And you never know what he is going to do. The last episode of fourth season is one of the best, but the fans knew that this amazing series couldn't finish like that.

And then, the amazing, unbelievable, incredible and wonderful fifth season came! I don't have enough words to describe this season. Since the first episode and then after each episode it was getting more tense and I had to watch almost the entire season in one or two days.

Hank was a very nice character and all the audience liked him. The same for Mike and Saul... Great job guys!

The last episode is crazy man... First, I would like to say that the soundtrack chosen was amazing. Baby Blue for who want to check it out.

I think the last scene of that series was perfect and I wouldn't do nothing different. The upshot for Walter and Jesse was worthy.

I watched the documentary about the last season and there was a really good environment. When each character made the last scene, they won a picture with autograph by all the team. Sometimes it was very emotional and Bryan Cranston is the funny guy I ever have seen.

Congratulations and thank you for this series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is the best TV series pair."
10.0,31 August 2020,You must watch this phenomenal series... Just Amazing
10.0,23 October 2019,I used to think Game of thrones was the greatest show ever made ...but then I watched BREAKING BAD . That's it .
7.0,25 September 2023,"I'm a big filmophile and 'showphile' and I have a big spectre of watched shows in my life and after my favorite show OZ, Breaking Bad is among it something very special in each and every aspect of it.

Vince Gillian create something unique, quality and best in each way and it will be very difficult to concure that.

So, we all need to be very happy that we have a brilliant and smart show like this in our life.

It doesn't be your favorite show but it needs to be a ""must watch"" show in every life.

I use IMDB at least 15 years but this is my first review here. I decide to spent my time and first review to wrote (be realistic) short thanks to best show ever exist."
4.0,2 July 2019,The greatest show of all timeThe greatest show of all timeThe greatest show of all time
10.0,16 September 2023,"It is a series in 6 seasons that was recommended by almost all friends from movies and series. The first seasons were not that interesting for me and I went slowly in watching it. But almost the last two and a half seasons gradually became more interesting and the viewing speed increased. The process of turning an ordinary person into a monster is gradually shown in the series. I still think the series could have been a little shorter and maybe some details could have been removed. Even the director of the series has given interviews about this issue of slow progress. Anyway, it is a very popular series. It is possible to accompany him and guess some events with difficulty. Although it's an interesting series overall, I still think it's not the most interesting series I've ever seen."
10.0,17 May 2020,Nice series actually but I think there is better actually
10.0,16 January 2022,"3 years now I have been trying to find the words to describe it, however, everything that comes to mind feels like it doesn't do the show justice. I hope one day I will be able to put into words what this show means to me and explain why it can not be compared with anything else in the tv and film industry."
10.0,25 December 2023,"""Breaking Bad is a flawless masterpiece, earning a perfect 10/10. Vince Gilligan's storytelling prowess weaves an intricate narrative, unraveling the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a complex antihero. The character development is unparalleled, with stellar performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Cinematography and direction elevate the series, creating a gritty atmosphere that mirrors the moral decay of its characters. The pacing is impeccable, maintaining tension throughout. Breaking Bad delivers an emotional rollercoaster, seamlessly blending suspense, dark humor, and poignant moments. The thematic depth and moral ambiguity make it a thought-provoking exploration of consequences. A benchmark in television, Breaking Bad sets the bar for excellence, leaving an indelible mark on the medium."""
10.0,19 October 2021,"In Short: I got more than I expected. The drama scenes are great and my favorite series is Breaking Bad. This is the Greatest of all time series.

Good sides: Crime, drama, thriller they are not the only genres, such as melodrama, romantic, comedy which is a great use of almost all genres."
10.0,26 July 2022,"The best series ever made and it's simply a fact, there is no other series that hits the spot like BB does. The storytelling, acting and the emotional attachment to characters makes the show amazing. You'll get a recommendation for a series such as peaky blinders and game of thrones and it can be a gamble but your simply an idiot if you don't think this is not 11/10."
10.0,23 February 2023,"This show is the true example of how to make a good TV show. The story is beautifully set up and connects perfectly with Better Call Saul. Saul mentioning Lalo blew my mind upon a second watch.

Everything is thought out, the colors have meaning and the props all have some sort of meaning. Everything a character does whether it be a major decision or just using a certain way of walking has its own hidden meaning. I could go on about that for hours.

The cinematography really captures how large but also small Albuquerque is, and the wide shots really amaze me every time. The unique directing as well with putting cameras on certain objects was astonishing.

The evolution of all the characters throughout the show is also perfect. Seeing Walter White change, Jesse Pinkman, or even Skyler.

There is NOTHING I would change about this show, this is true perfection."
7.0,14 June 2019,"Late to witness it, and u regret it.Well i quit gym for this whole week to complete it, among going to office and all I only got few hourse which i spent on it. Quite addictive. Character of Walter White will be remembey whole life.It affects you personally.It is entertaining , exciting and interesting every episode that you wanna spend your whole day on it. Performances and some dialogues are top notch. Screenplay is brilliant. Don't miss this at all."
3.0,6 January 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece of television. The writing is top-notch, with complex and compelling characters, a well-developed plot, and impeccable attention to detail. The acting is superb, with standout performances from Bryan Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman. The cinematography is stunning, with breathtaking shots of the New Mexico landscape.

The show's portrayal of the descent of a good man into darkness is both poignant and gut-wrenching, and the tension and drama are expertly crafted and maintained throughout the series.

Overall, ""Breaking Bad"" is a must-watch for any fans of drama and character development. It deserves a perfect score of 10 out of 10."
10.0,6 December 2021,"Its my best tv show ever , walter white , jesse pinkman , mike , gus all of them was a great characters , rare actions , interesting story , new and rare story talks about chemistry ."
10.0,16 May 2019,This the greatest Tv show ever don't come at me with GoT or the sopranos or any other Tv show this is just the greatest Tv show the way it starts and how it's plot and it's progression is just insane and with such a low budget as well every character has its own arc walt sky jesse mike Saul walt jr they all did an excellent job on this show and the way it ended was so perfect that you didn't ask for more episodes or more information because your satisfied and amazed and shocked how the show ended and a final thank you to Vince Gilligan his writing and characterization is just great thanks to the whole cast and crew members for this great piece of art that is breaking bad
10.0,13 December 2013,"Honestly, I don't know if it was the hype around it before I started to watch it, but I simply don't see what others see. I see a slow plot, with many filler episodes, a countless number of irrelevant content, characters that aren't lovable enough and a show not getting to the pint quick enough. As much as I want to love this show and give it a 10, I can't, and the only reason I'm not going any lower in my rating is because of Bryan Cranston...he deserves all of the praise he is getting. He is a great actor.

I can't understand the hype around this show. Though I do admit to be at the beginning of season 5, this season has to be what it is hyped up to be, in order to get my tick of approval."
10.0,7 November 2020,"Unrealistic characters and poor writing make this show painful to watch. Lacks subtlety and craftsmanship, just like a never ending cheap movie that even good actors would fail to play for the witing is not cohesive. It's entertaining for a while but it quickly becomes boring, then painful because too unrealistic and deprived likeable characters. Stopping in the middle of season two."
10.0,1 May 2021,"I regret watching it, because I know I wont watch a better show in a long time if ever."
10.0,27 April 2021,This is officially the best tv show I've seen in my life. It's incredible how with each season this show gets better and better until season 5 which I think is the best one. Every person in the world should watch this masterpiece.

10.0,19 April 2021,"The only thing I can say that is bad after watching the series, is the knowledge that you will certainly never be able to see a series of this caliber again. It's a bittersweet feeling. Heisenberg rules!!!!!"
7.0,6 October 2021,"What more can i say ? Probably the only TV show that doesn't contain boring parts and episodes, nothing is wasted. Everything is brilliant, from writing, character development, whole atmosphere to soundtrack and sceneography."
5.0,13 June 2023,"Without a question, Breaking Bad is the best show I have ever watched; it is the height of achievement. Despite the fact that I have a lot of viewing experience, Breaking Bad stood out among the competition and set the bar so high that no competitor could even come close. You should definitely start this fascinating journey if you're on the fence about doing so, I can assure you. You won't be sorry. Breaking Bad is a magnificent piece of art that will grab your interest, elicit strong feelings from you, and leave you feeling uplifted. You'll thank me later if you watch this goat show; there are 62 excellent episodes."
10.0,16 January 2020,"My first series turns out to be my best series ever.... amazing screenplay, worth watching👌🏻"
10.0,8 December 2019,"Very good tv show. Lot of drama, some twists. Good acting, especially Cranston, who shines as much in drama as he does in comedy. Some characters became unbearable to me, but I guess it's also a sign that's it a well done show. A couple of very ""hollywood cliché"" things, but not to the point where it's too much."
10.0,18 October 2019,"This show set out with a goal. The main character was going to completely change over time. It accomplished this, and with some incredible television in the process. This show is so perfectly threaded all the way to the end and in this, to the absolute detail. In this show, you will see some of the best acting that has ever been exuded, particularly Bryan Cranston's performance of Walter White, which I regard as the greatest acting performance that I have ever witnessed, along with Heath Ledger's performance of the Joker in The Dark Knight. Giancarlo Espacito as Gustavo Fring and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman do some sensational acting as well however. Pretty much every element of this show is levels above any other show from the acting, to the writing, to the cinematography, to the direction, and pretty much every element. The relationship between the two main characters Jesse Pinkman and Walter White is really the driving force of the brilliance in this show. The chemistry, no pun intended, between Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston is truly incredible and a marvel to watch. The relationship between these two characters goes on such a rollercoaster in this show, and it's simply a marvelous thing to behold and experience. In the end, the two switch roles in a sense. Jesse Pinkman was somebody who found himself in this dangerous business but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. Walter White is somebody who found himself as a chemistry teacher but should not be in there in terms of who he truly is. In the end, Jesse needed to get out of there and get away from the monster that his ex-teacher has become. It's truly an amazing thing to see, the radical changes that the characters go through. As Walt says in the first episode, chemistry is the study of change. And that's what this show is as well. Walter White, this seemingly-regular-chemistry-teacher-turned-wicked-druglord, is the greatest character I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a work of art. Bryan Cranston's performance allows us to see all of the nuances of his character and what goes on in his mind, and we see him transform before our eyes. The show has so many moments that will stun you, so many moments that will live on in pop culture long, long past the demise of this show, and so many moments that will make you marvel at the brilliance that you are witnessing. As intense and large scale as the show gets, it pretty much always stays in realism. That's one of the main factors that drives Breaking Bad apart from a lot of other shows. Whether comedy or serious, you can truly believe that this is what would happen next if this was reality- if this high school chemistry teacher really did become this murderer. The best fantastical and generally large-scale shows are the ones that are made realistically as we can engulf in ourselves in this world and crazy situation, and that is a joy. To feel like we're really experiencing something that's so insane and unusual. And that's the feeling that you get with this show. The writing crew let the characters drive the story rather than the writers. They didn't add the scenes that they wanted to happen; they added the scenes that they thought would happen. That's what drives Breaking Bad apart, and in this realism, we still end up with some of the most intense and incredible moments that have ever occurred in a show. This show really is as good as they say. I've never seen a better show, and I'm not sure I ever will. This is as close to perfection that I have ever seen a show reach. Vince Gilligan is a genius, and I thank him and the rest of the cast and crew for this beautifully twisted masterpiece of art."
10.0,9 September 2019,Its extremely overrated and not comparable to other tv series like got its also very boring and cant make u to watch many episodes in a row.7 is the score i give
10.0,27 July 2019,"This show started off mildly engaging and plausible, but by the second season it descended into an infinite regression of the ludicrous, and with each scene, episode, and season it not only became more ludicrous but duller too. I know I am almost alone here in my view of this The Emperor's New Clothes of a series..."
10.0,10 January 2022,"Just finished watching this for the second time after first watching it when it was first released. So many things I'd forgot that had happened, I was sucked into each scene like I'd never seen it before.

Only criticism for me personally is a couple episodes in each easier were maybe needlessly dragged out. Other than that, probably my favourite show of all time."
10.0,19 July 2021,"THE GREATEST TV SHOW EVER MADE. Just watch it if you haven't already, definitely till the end..you won't regret it I promise."
10.0,31 October 2021,I didn't watch this when it was on as a Dad I didn't want to see drugs or those who make them glorified. I was wrong and if your on the fence get off it and hit play this will go down as one of the greatest series in my lifetime.
7.0,17 April 2021,No words. Just amazing. Every season gets better and better.
5.0,20 August 2022,"It's really amazing the way that this show literally CHANGE your life (for better). The characters, the plot, the filming, it's ALL incredible. And if you liked the show, you should see the other productions of the breaking bad world, like better call saul and el camino."
10.0,25 August 2022,The number one best show of all time! Much better than both Planet Earth shows because it has a lot more drama and great actors. This show has one of the best fanbases ever that have changed American history.
10.0,24 August 2022,"Breaking Bad, the definition of good TV.

From the first chapter to the last there is a story well told.

I finished watching it for the second time and it still seems like one of the best series I've ever seen, I would see it for the third, fourth and even a fifth time and I would never get tired of watching it."
10.0,7 November 2021,"I have never seen a production which I was so integrated with its characters. The flow of the series and the way the director delivers it to the screen is unique. You both hate and love the main characters. Out of respect for this production, I lower the score 9 to the series which I watched before and gave 10 points. I'm pessimistic about what can be done beter."
10.0,29 December 2012,"So I started watching this show after seeing a lot of people recommend it and after spending the last month watching it I have to say it's very average.

From season one it started out slow paced with the main character constantly making decisions that I as a viewer wanted him to make 3 episodes earlier. Granted this show is all about the main character Walt going from high school teacher to drug dealer so it's not going to happen over night.

The real problem I have found with this show is the fact that the characters don't have a likable nature to them, the main character is a 50 year old high school teacher who flashes into the character everyone wants to see then back out into this boring old guy who makes the whole show slow down.

Overall the show is OK but not great."
10.0,1 June 2021,"It's just a typical crime series with overrated story and poor premise.

So one being broke and turning to drug production and all the nonsense dramas in between is now the new Masterpiece?

I may die trying to figure people's minds out who gave this show of all shows a 10 star rating."
10.0,8 June 2023,"Bow down to the Greatest Of All Time Series 🙌there's no doubt in it. Believe it THE HYPE IS REAL FOR THE SERIES. This series is perfect from every end. Acting, Story, Dialogues, Cinematography, Sound, Editing everything is perfectly executed 🔥. Vince Gilligan creator of this masterpiece is truly a mastermind. Every actor who played their respective roles / character they just lived in their role & gave their best no doubt in it. From the 1st episode to the last episode is just Mind blowing, no series can be soo perfect like BREAKING BAD. Most of the series fail to be perfect because of the ending or the beginning but... Here the Starting & Ending is perfectly balanced and they have give a proper justice to all the characters in it. Bryan Cranston & Araon Paul the lead actors of the series are the true gems of the series they just lived in their character. Speaking of facts: Aron Paul never went to any Acting classes & won multiple number of awards for his acting.

🙌GOAT OF ALL DAMN SERIES🙌"

Nothing more to add."
10.0,11 October 2021,"Breaking Bad is so good that all other tv shows........and most every movie ever made, pale in comparison. Every part of it, from plot, acting, filming, writing, locations is just so good. How one person's actions can affect the lives of so many others should be a teaching moment for every human. Now, eight years after the last episode aired, it still resonants with people around the world and will forever be the benchmark for anyone trying to tell a story on tv or films that shows every aspect of how humans are obviously the strangest and most flawed animals to ever live on this planet. Long live Walter and the wonderful world of Breaking Bad."
10.0,2 April 2020,"'Breaking Bad' is The Greatest Show In The History, period. Brilliant storytelling, stellar cast, well tied plot and amazing charactes building. Engaging drama that would let you forget the world outside. Yes, it is the best. Period."

9.0,19 July 2012,"I now watch the third season to waste time and am amazed how this got it high rankings. It has been nothing but, killing, drug dealing, drug usage, deaths, overdoses, orphans, stealing, lying, diseases, depression, stress, fighting, injustice, scamming, murdering and massive disasters, divorce, therapy, rehab, cancer, peoples lives get destroyed, No humor, no normal healthy human relations. What is there left, a guy making a drug empire? We have that in Scarface, and it's nothing like this, maybe because it isn't filled with 5 season of bad things happening to everyone involved. It's all just depressing. The acting is good, but the script is just depressing...."
10.0,11 September 2020,Watch 1 episode or a few or maybe a season or just binge the whole series...it's all good in the (yellow) hood.
10.0,26 June 2021,This is the best TV show i have ever watched. GOT is the second best.
10.0,5 August 2023,"I watched this show 4 seasons in, because the hype was there. Couldn't make it through the first couple episodes, too slow. Finally followed through. What can I say, the acting, characters, story. Absolutely incredible, Bryan Cranston as Walter white is amazing, his transition to Heisenberg. Aaron Paul as Jesse pinkman, the relationship between them the manipulative mind of Mr.white. The writing keeps you guessing at all times, never knowing in the most do or die scenarios what might happen. It's no wonder this show has 16 Emmy's. Thank you Vince Gilligan. Genuinely is the greatest show I have seen."
10.0,28 October 2018,I never saw anything like that. Cast was so perfect that no one can replace anyone.
7.0,26 June 2021,"Not much else to say. If nothing is perfect, this show is easily as close to that as a show can get. A masterpiece through and through, it's the one show I can watch all the way through over and over again, yet not grow bored or lose interest in it. I could go into depth as to why this show is so phenomenal, but I'd be here all day. So shut up and take my 10 star rating!"
5.0,2 May 2021,"I watch the whole series a second time over. It was like watching it for the first time. Still highly tense, nail biting scenes gripped me from start to end. Makes me feel nostalgic thinking about it."
9.0,30 July 2022,"Best tv show ever made. Bryan Cranston's acting performance is the best of all time. Everything is just perfect.

Side note: (Skyler singing happy birthday to ted is the worst scene ever)"
10.0,18 May 2019,Not even a word! Absolutely 10 out of 10. Best series of all time.
10.0,30 July 2022,"Breaking Bad is basically the story of Walter White, a meek but brilliant Albuquerque, New Mexico high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and with the help of a former student already selling drugs, secretly resorts to cooking meth to supplement his income in order to pay his mountain of medical bills and to provide for his pregnant wife and son with cerebral palsy after his death.

Back when he was a graduate student, Walt was instrumental in forming an innovative start-up, but his business partners took advantage of him and he sold his shares in the company for a pittance and lost the opportunity to make millions.

Walt now discovers he's not only adept at cooking meth, but also in lying to his family and dealing with the dangerous and frightening criminals he meets as he expands his business enterprise and makes more money than he ever thought possible. All under the unwitting nose of his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, a dedicated DEA agent, who sees the clues but is unable or unwilling to believe they could be connected to Walt.

The series proceeds over 62 tense episodes and five seasons as Walt loses his moral compass and descends into committing murder and deceit with a surprising arrogance and confidence.

Bryan Cranston stars as Walt in a career defining role reminiscent of James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano. He is ably supported by a cast including Dean Norris as Hank the DEA agent and Bob Odenkirk as a shyster lawyer so popular with the viewers that he earned his own show featuring his Breaking Bad character, Saul Goodman.

The series is dramatically intense while interspersed with dark humor, and succeeds up until the last episode when Walt builds a device in the trunk of his car, which for it to work needs to be positioned perfectly and for everyone to behave exactly as, and to be standing precisely where, Walt had planned. It's much too neat, if not ridiculous an ending, and ruined what could and should have been an effective finale to an exciting series."
10.0,14 July 2019,"I forced myself to watch all seasons just cause friends said it's getting way better on last seasons.

Breaking bad is not an action, adventure or thriller movie. It's just a drama, a miserable boring drama.

That Jesse whining all the time omg, I was like please someone kill him so won't watch more of his face.

I know I will get a hell of downvotes but that's ok, guess it's all about taste.

Making this review so people who are like me won't waste their time. Watch 2 episodes,if you don't like it then just stop watching. Nothing will change.

For me the best series ever is 24. Jack Bauer is the answer, now tell me what's the question!"
10.0,8 October 2022,
10.0,5 June 2021,"Breaking bad is a series TV show which made me speechless. Seriously I don't know any words to describe it well. When I watch breaking bad, I kept clapping my hand over and over till I feel pain on my palms. During most of the scenes, I also put my both hand's thumbs up infront of the screen. When I was watching the show, I remember there were many moments in which I was prompt to scream enthusiastically and have what Americans call it ""goose pumps"". Seriously my whole body react to it as the show is extremely amazing and breath taking. I can say that I couldn't be more thrilled, moved and blown. When I remember what is written about breaking bad on Wikipedia, I just get satisfied. It's written on the critical response paragraph and says ""breaking bad is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time"". And not that I have watched all movies and series, but I completely agree because it must be. How could there be any movie or series better than breaking bad not just now but even in the future? Generally all I can say is it's the best series I have ever seen. I mean I wish there are better words than ""best"" to describe it so that I can be more satisfied but there aren't. Finally I strongly suggest that anyone who loves movies and series should definitely watch it. I sometimes be jealous of people who didn't watch it yet, because I kind of want to erase it off my brain and watch it again so I can re-experience all those moments and feeling I got when I first watched it. But fortunately I can still get some of those feelings because I didn't get enough of it.

Alex Bekele."
10.0,13 January 2024,"Breaking bad is the best series I've ever watched. Every episode i have watched of this series is good and its never not interesting. Each episode of the series is very throughly planned and it really pays off. I recommend abseloutly everyone to watch this series the series is filled with a little bit of everything's as it involves lots of characters and their point of view. In my experience some characters came across as annoying at first but after getting to know them I came to love the character, as i said every episode is planned thoroughly so some scenes contain information that might be brung up in later episodes. For me this series is a 10/10 it is a must watch."
9.0,10 April 2024,"This series was like really good.

My wife left me and she took the kids and the dog AND the house. But they all came back after I saw this series. Also, my dog had stage 67 cancer and this series healed him so we could say this series heals illnesses!

This series is like the best, when whalter white spreads his crystals around the world is amazing, it's so good I quit buying cigarettes and crystal meth like whalter makes, zoooooowieeeee mama, baazinga, this series was great I came to it, it was sooooo gooood

I love it when whalter white says ""it's waltin' time"" and Walters' all over the place, I love it.."
6.0,31 May 2019,"Since the last season of GoT was trash, GoT fans have come in waves to rate BB 1/10 out of pure bitterness. I am here to combat this, so here's a 10/10.

Also, Breaking Bad is a really great TV show."
5.0,19 September 2020,"Okay many of you must have read all the reviews, so I will skip that part. I came here to say that I totally LOVE the show! And the ending always makes me emotional and that song 'Baby Blue' is a perfect song for the finale ending! GUESS I GOT WHAT I DESERVED..."
10.0,21 September 2020,"Breaking Bad has been off the air for some years now, but til this day, it continues to be the most entertaining and enjoyable television show out there. I believe nothing comes close. Every character demonstrates the brilliance of Vince Gilligan's writing. They all serve a purpose and move the story along for what seems to feel like an exhilarating roller coaster ride.

Well deserving of it's multiple awards and by far, hands down, the best. One last point, the binge watchers, who didn't have to wait for new weekly episodes, will never understand the cruel and unusual punishment of having to wait a whole week to find out what happened next. My only wish is to have a reset button in my brain, so that I may experience this show for the first time again..."
10.0,20 June 2019,"Literally the best show I have ever seen. Far from idealism, Breaking bad shows how the human greediness and the willingness to control can easily flip the coin in our minds and can change our conception and perspectives. No matter how educated you are, no matter what is your social status, you can easily sink in a swamp of sin, what it needs is blurry and fuzzy principles and a strong trigger to justify the acts. The character Walter white was the most influencing characters in the movie. The one who is between the hammer of sickness and the anvil of family. the character evolution of Whalter White, Jesse Pinkman and Skyler White is drastic and amazing at the same time. The show thought us that your acts today decide how you will be tomorrow."
10.0,21 October 2014,"Season 1&2 are mind blowing good. Though Season 2 is slightly uneven between episodes , the overall impression is coherent and some episodes even stand out as some the best of the whole series.

Episode 3 Is a major change in pace and a very obvious brain-drain in both direction and the all important drama becomes scetchy and loses a lot of flow compared to Season 1&2 ,wich the actors in no way are to blame. They are indeed making the process somewhat believable despite the over-the-top cuts between scenes,moods and the gradual brakedown of the portrayed characters. I am still to watch season 4 in full (There is season 5 also) And Season 4 in this moment (Episode 3) is moving towards more display of blood sputtering then the smart psychological thriller ""Braking Bad"" started out with in season 1&2. Sad but true."
10.0,27 March 2014,
10.0,15 April 2020,"10/10, hands down. Objectively and subjectively a great show. It's #1 on my personal list - over South Park, X-Files, Friends, and Cheers.

I can't really say anything that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece, so I'll just say that the characters, story, and overall premise and writing are completely masterfully produced.

Breaking Bad will be remembered as a timeless classic."
10.0,4 February 2021,"The best series I have ever watched, the best thing that distinguishes the series is that the level of the series continues to rise to the last episode and the series has finished perfectly. The story of the series The series may seem simple, but it becomes deeper and better in the coming seasons. Acting in the series was great from almost all the actors, the best My characters in the series are Walter White, Mike, Gus Fring, and Saul, while the worst characters in the series were Walter Jr., Skyler and Marie, and I was amazed at some of the people who hated Walter because he kills and deceives people in the series. The series is realistic and this is what defines the series, and some of these people put their account picture in the picture of the Joker or Thomas Shelby who did worse things than Walter did. The series is the best series you have ever watched and I recommend watching it. You may feel bored in the first season, but other seasons are getting better and evaluate the seasons. The first is 8/10, the second is 8.8 / 10, the third is 9/10, the fourth is 9.5 / 10, and the fifth is 9.9 / 10. My evaluation of the series in general is 9.7 / 10"
9.0,30 September 2013,"Visiting IMDb forever now, but for the first time felt need to register and write something. So proud to brag around how I watched pilot episode on it's premier night, not having a clue what is it about beforehand, got hooked up on it and watched almost every episode on it's premier night including the last one. Comparison to any other contemporary TV series ( of any genre) seems simply unfair, that how much better BB is. 'Sopranos' comes close to it, except it was just new approach to old good mafia stories. BB was (uh, 'was'!) original piece on so many levels, surprising in it's story line, characters build up, shooting, cinematography and you name the rest. And you can tell it was a labor of great love, from it's creator, writers, actors and others. The best judge of all, time, will give it it's stamp one day, but for now it stands tall, head and shoulders above anything I have seen in last10-15 years. It wasn't perfect all the way, but never stumbled either,amazing for 62 episodes long show. No idea when or who is going to make something this impactful, but I am not getting my hopes high"
10.0,20 August 2013,"It's great. It's what people have always wanted from crime drama; it's about pride, desperation, decision, obsession, escalation, and the toll on relationship--including relationship with one's self--that ensues.

The writing is great. On rare, rare occasions there might be a shadow of a false note; either an ""off"" usage, or a foray into character exploration that seems a little ill-considered. But even these add genuine color to the product. Think of them as a blue tinge to a very pure artistic product.

The production values are great, and all personnel deliver, from top to bottom. As I write they're rolling out the final half of season 5; just saw episode 10, and it utterly rips your heart out.

Breaking Bad will go down as classic television; amongst the best ever."
7.0,12 October 2019,I only started watching this because the reviews were so high. After the first couple of episodes I thought I'll give it another few weeks. By the end of the first season I was a fan. I've watched this entire story many times over. Never get bored watching it. Simply the best TV show ever made.
4.0,11 October 2020,"If Shawshank is the best movie in history or gta v is the best game made in the game world, then it is no exaggeration to consider Breaking Bad as the best man-made in the field of serialization."
10.0,23 May 2019,"Everything that's brilliant about it has already been said.

For people who previously couldn't decide between this and GoT, well now you know.

For GoT fans who dare rate this 1/10 out of spite and bitterness, SHAME ON YOU. Did you know that the (incompetent) makers of GoT looked up to Breaking Bad and wanted to have a series finale that's as GOOD as it had? Well they FAILED miserably.

Breaking Bad is superior. Brilliant from BEGINNING to END. And THAT is why it is the BEST."
10.0,30 June 2010,"Breaking Bad has two significant problems: first, it makes everything else on TV look pale or silly in comparison; second, it's only on TV once a week (and only for a few months a year).

Simply put, Breaking Bad is the best serialized drama in the history of television. There is nothing to fault. The acting, the characterizations, the plots, everything is absolutely top-notch. And each week ends with a cliff-hanger that makes you wish it were next week already so you can see the next episode. I didn't know a show could be so effective for so long. Season 1 is incredible; season 2 is at least as good; and season 3 is the best season of any show ever made. Now that season 3 is over, life will not be quite right until season 4 begins. The good news: there WILL be a season 4. The bad news: it won't begin until July 2011.

If you haven't seen this series, buy or rent the discs and watch it in order. But don't go too fast or you'll run out of episodes before season 4 starts."
10.0,26 July 2023,"The series tackles complex themes such as morality, the consequences of actions, and the fall into darkness of a seemingly well-intentioned man. The way ""Breaking Bad"" explores the psychological and moral transformation of Walter White over the course of five seasons is fascinating and often draws deep reflections from the audience. In conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" is an outstanding series with an engaging story, excellent performances and strong messages. If you're into intense drama and complex characters, this series should be on your watch list. My favorite character was Walter White because he is very intelligent and knows how to seize situations."
10.0,21 April 2022,"Most of the TV shows out there are mere entertaining pieces of work but, Breaking bad is an experience. With every character's story, the beautiful camera work, the tension, the psychological changes and literally the breaking bad element makes you experience it real in your mind. Though some moments don't appeal you much, some parts are slow, some parts are boring, but the build up it leads to turns that story into an experience.

Apart experience breaking bad is a very good story, the way it starts and the way it ends surely grabs the viewers attention and keep them on chair for the 5 seasons.

Personally the best thing about breaking bad for me is that it isn't obsessed with typical sex, typical dialogues or typical TV show patterns. It gave me many different ideas, it gave me different perspectives and also made me think which most TV shows don't do for me."
10.0,11 July 2019,"I lasted until the third season with this. It started off initially good and had an intriguing concept but by season three it began to run out of steam, all the characters were unsympathetic and when it started laying the foundations of his wife having an affair, I realised that the initial concept was being replaced by a tedious daytime family soap opera.

Wasted opportunity and I can't help but think it gets such good press because believe that saying they liked it makes them look cool rather than it actually being something special."
10.0,29 May 2019,"The Greatest TV Show of All Times. Absolutely Best Character Ever "" Walter White "" I rated this show 10/10 Long Live Breaking Bad"
10.0,20 May 2019,"The best TV show of all time, starting from the first season and how WW has changed his character to be a monster, what a masterpiece TV show. The best of all time"
10.0,18 October 2011,"I will always love film but every once in a while a TV show will come along and blow any one time 2 hour experience out of the water. I had it with The Sopranos, then The Wire, and now with Breaking Bad. This is TV with quality as high as some of the best films made. The format allows time to really develop characters and get you involved with the complicated plot threads. No show would be any good without quality acting (this is a major issue I had with programmes like Lost), and the acting here is excellent. The casting director for this series deserves awards. All the emotions that the actors portray within their roles are completely believable, and engrossing. The writing is concise and intelligent; not afraid to be slow with its pace but always driving forwards, whilst still providing moments of exhilaration. The direction is smooth, concentrating on excellent cinematography to really get the look of a good quality film - and consistent throughout. What makes this series stand out most for me is that each season is different. It is not about recreating what has already been seen previous but concentrates more on changing situations and character relationships quite dramatically - and this is how it improves, with the fourth season being amongst the best Television seasons I have ever witnessed. I long for more series of this calibre. BREAKING BAD 10/10."
7.0,8 June 2020,"Since the invention of motion picture, this is the greatest thing ever made"
4.0,10 October 2020,...unless you want to be hooked to it. It's like the meth it portrays... simply addictive. I compare everything I watch now to this... and nothing ever measures up. I never thought it was possible to love a TV show this much but I digress.... it broke me bad... pure excellence in every way.
10.0,23 September 2022,"Breaking Bad is an awesome yet tragic story of two odd balls. One is an overqualified chemistry teacher and the other is a bum who gets high and has sex with prostitutes. They create one the most perplexing and ironic character dynamics in all of fiction.

Plot: 9/10 I am a big fantasy guy. I have always preferred fantasy stories because it gives way for creative and out of this world storylines. That was a concern for me while watching Breaking Bad because I might not enjoy it due to it being set in a real world. I was wrong. Breaking Bad is well planned and thought out well. It has intelligent scenes and plans while also not having any plot holes. I still believe fantasy is better at making plotlines but Breaking Bad did not disappoint. Another thing breaking Bad did better than other TV shows was that it didn't stretch itself out. It had its run and ended when it should.

Characters: 10/10 This was the biggest surprise for me. The characters in this TV show are incredibly well written. Possibly one the best in all of fiction. They have complex characters with not the best morals. Their conflicts create scenes that stress you out. I cannot talk about it enough without spoiling anything.

Acting:10/10 This backs up the characters and their scenes. The casting of the two main protagonists were perfect. They had a chemistry that helped make the dynamic duo we see in the show. The side characters also have amazing acting. The crying, the anger, the frustration were all portrayed beautifully by the actors."
8.0,14 June 2019,"Simply put in three words: Apex, unprecedented & unparalleled. The only one sharing the throne with Bbad in this genre is The Sopranos. I could go on forever and give you plenty of reasons why but there is no time to waist on talk here. Just watch it and tell me I'm wrong, it won't change the reality of the situation. This show is in my top 5 best series of all time. Enjoy! (Or not... ;)"
10.0,3 January 2021,"As a person who has watched many top rated TV shows (Game of Thrones included), this just so happens to best. The plot, the cinematography, the acting, everything is top notch. It may not have the same production quality as some newer shows yet it will always be closest to my heart and I feel the need to give it a standing ovation every time I watch it. Simply amazing."
9.0,28 May 2020,Definitely good but not the best for me. I can see getting a more realistic perspective on topics like that was something innovative at the time but watching it for the first time in 2020 honestly felt kinda boring and slow. Maybe my expectations were too high considering the huge hype around this show.
10.0,24 August 2013,"Although late to start watching this series, after having read the multitude of praise and high scores for it i decided to set aside my reservations on the premise, and just dive in. And now i am writing this review after viewing the first two seasons...

Firstly i will start with the positive: Really fantastic acting, and there is without a doubt a completely professional team behind the creation of this series.

Now for the bad: It is very slow paced indeed. And with the sparse comedic moments and the constantly serious themes that are the underlying backbone for this show, it makes for some very miserable viewing. What i would compare this to, is like reading a somewhat interesting article, where it is formatted in just one very very very long unbroken paragraph with no gaps or light at all. So the end result is that it teases you to keep watching, but it's almost tortuous to get through. And it doesn't ever leave you feeling properly ""entertained"".

Although first impressions from the synopsis might leave people suspecting it is still probably mainly a male-orientated action series. Mark my words, it is not. It actually has more akin with being a very dark soap-opera of sorts. And thus i would personally be far more likely to recommend it to female colleagues and friends rather than any male ones.

Perhaps indeed the serious themes of the series mean that it must continue to be the way it is... without any glorification aspects at all. But when to the viewer, the almost constant misery far outweighs any of the rewards gleaned by the storyline and characters. Then there is little or no actual enjoyment to be garnered. And therefore this series ends up just holding too little in the way of actual entertainment value. It is a times interesting, but ultimately and unfortunately it is also for the main part quite depressing."
10.0,30 January 2020,"I used to be one of those people that got easily pleased by everything in media, enjoyed it, and ignored writing flaws. Then I watched this show, observed the writing and direction and realized that THIS is what high quality writing looks like. Ever since, I've been a harsh critic of TV and Film. Unless it has Breaking Bad quality writing, I'll criticize it to bits. Which is why I barely watch modern television anymore. I'm stuck in the good old days of TV. I thought that GOT was on par with Breaking Bad's level of writing in it's first 3-4ish seasons. But that writing quality been going down a drain since S5. This show has made it clear. THIS is the staple of what all modern TV shows and movies should strive to be. Cohesive, immerseful, thoughtful and entertaining.

Hats off to you Vince Gilligan. Hats off to you and the BRILLIANT cast!

Best show I've ever watched. I'm on marathon #10 or something"
10.0,10 August 2023,
10.0,27 March 2016,
6.0,5 August 2022,"I was a bit reluctant to start watching this, because of the subject material. But after a few episodes I was hooked. Each season seems to improve and Vince Gilligan is a master at weaving plots, with seemingly insignificant details that later become key devices in the storyline. It's a story about evil, greed, deceit and innocence betrayed. I'd give it a 10 but there are quite a few developments in the final season that are so far beyond belief and stretch all levels of incredulity that makes BB border on being cartoonish."
3.0,25 July 2020,Someone please wash my brain so that I can watch this masterpiece again.
10.0,15 February 2019,"Yeah... a masterpiece! If you never seen Breaking Bad... please, make yourself a favor, maratone this!"
10.0,12 February 2022,"It's unbelievable how each and every aspect of this show makes realistic sense, at times in context with how hilariously funny it gets. This is not just some great-to-watch show with a well-crafted story that you binge, it's a forever obsession to cherish, might be the best of shows I could've rated so far."
10.0,9 August 2021,"This show has a very complex plot and it is really interesting. I couldn't stop watching this because of how good this is. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are one of the greatest duos that I've seen, the side cast is great and the antagonists are incredible, an example for the 1st season: Emilio and Krazy-8. The ending is perfect and overall the show is really consistent."
10.0,19 August 2022,

10.0,14 October 2021,"I've watched several thousands of hours of box sets, this is the only one I've watched anything twice.

After reading Bryan Cranston's autobiography I came back for a second time and it's still sensational."
10.0,14 July 2022,No television program will ever top this. Every single thing about this show is pure perfection. I wish I could wipe my memory and watch this show for the first time all over again.
6.0,1 October 2022,"How can I even get started on this masterpiece of a show. Almost everything about it is executed perfectly.

1. The music always delivers a banger that even I go back to listen to on my free time cause it's so great

2. The character work is brilliant. Over the course of the series we see Walter whites family slowly going deeper into the criminal underworld and the side characters are amazing at making you care about them and the world they live in i never would have thought the saddest deaths in the series would be side characters

3. This show has really great subtlety that really pays off etc the characters clothing and some lines of dialogue."
2.0,6 August 2021,Great. It's very good. Never seen a show quite like this. Believe the hype and go on watch it.
10.0,14 August 2018,"This series was amazing. I don't know anyone who has watched it and didn't like it, or didn't argue that it was the best series ever made. The writing is not rushed at all, the acting is perfect, but the camera work is probably one of the strongest points.

Breaking Bad follows the formula of ""show, don't tell"". In this case, a technique that allows the viewer to experience what is happening through action and acting itself instead of plain exposition. The acting is so good and because of how good it is, you, the viewer, are able to perceive exactly how the characters feel. Every last one of the actors and actresses are excellent in their job to act. Because of the good acting, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are some of my favourite actors, and I've noticed that their acting is just as good in other productions, if not better than ever.

If you didn't know already, the plot is about a Chemistry professor who decides to use his expertise by producing the world's purest crystal meth in order to insure his family's financial status after his death, using a former student of his who deals drugs.

This show begins with very mildly humorous, to dark, dramatic, fairly action-y, and just downright epic the more it goes on. The seasons are not rushed, the directing is top notch. I've even read from people that the fact that it ended made them pretty much depressed. Normally I wouldn't believe that, but then, I did experience it for myself because the show is THAT good. The OST is great. Each episode even has it's own brief OST in the credits after the first season.

I have heard that some don't like it, usually because of the whole hype and ""WOW BREAKING BAD IS SO GREAT"" fans bothering them with it. I understand that, but if you watched the show and tried to ignore them, you'd like it.

If there's one word to describe this show and the main character, that word is Badass. Don't skip the opportunity to watch it."
10.0,4 August 2021,There's no debate here it literally is the greatest thing you can physically watch.
9.0,20 December 2016,"If Breaking Bad was the first TV series to ever exist, something incredible certainly would have made history. If it were to be the last show to ever run, that would make it a perfectly historical culmination. However, as it arrived eight years into the 21st Century, it ranks as a game changer for television eternally.

None of the films and any other TV show I've seen in my lifetime have impressed me as much as this. It's impossible to describe this series in one word but it deserves to be described with every single positive one ever created on this planet.

It's pretty staggering how much creator Vince Gillian and his crew beat the odds to tell a story about a man who rises to crime by cooking drugs after his cancer diagnosis. The way Walter White changes from a family guy to a money-obsessed drug lord is incredible. Okay, its subject matter obviously isn't for the faint of heart but whether you're into that or not, you'll be hooked to this thing like what that disgusting drug does to people.

It's not just a crime show, its more than just that. In fact there's so much to obsess over: the character development and dialogue are professionally thought-out and never cheat, the cinematography is experimental, the direction is strong and the locations are beautifully staged. The writing is by far the selling point of the series. The team of ten writers (including Gilligan) know how to keep the story moving from one moment to the next with unstoppable energy while absorbing unique ideas that never feel or become stale and derivative. They also understand how to capture the horrific transformation of a normal human turning evil unhurriedly. Kudos to the directors for translating them onto screen, which is just as impressive due to the fact that their work is so seamless that the audience can become completely unaware of it. Notable directors Rian Johnson (Star Wars: Episode VIII) and David Slade (The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) helm a few episodes which adds as a bonus to the series' success.

The storytelling is of the highest order. It's clear Gillian isn't a by-the-numbers storyteller, he cares about characterisation and slow introduction for the colourful and dark world he's created. From the first episode to the very last, nearly every frame roots for the beauty of character-driven narrative as well as artistic cinematography that vaguely shows the beautiful locations in the background. We care for these characters, we follow them, we relate to them in some way. To be truthful, they feel realistic throughout the entire series. If only films adapted this element better.

Bryan Cranston is mind-blowing as Walter White. Anchored by the writing, he sets the character up perfectly as he gets sucked into the criminal underworld. His attitude towards everyday life slowly begins to change throughout the series, and it's played beautifully. Aaron Paul is awesome as Jesse Pinkman, portraying an uneven post-student drug addict in all the best ways. He's funny, argumentative but you also oddly enough care for him in many parts of the show.

Dean Norris is top-notch as DEA brother-in-law Hank. He plays a little with comedic attitude throughout the first couple of seasons but that slowly fades away as the story gets darker. Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are spectacular at wife Skyler and son Walter, Jr. They have the characteristics to support a normal family before all hell breaks loose.

If they're any flaws, there is perhaps only one. While the cinematography is stylistic, the first half of the series is viewed from a hand-held perspective, making the experience sometimes slightly frustrating but luckily later on it turns to the camera placement that I can handle. Without giving anything away, the finale is anything but average which is a low for the show. It doesn't have the same richness that the pilot had, but hey, you can't have everything.

A TV series can go on for years or maybe decades, but what this did so damn well was that it finished exactly when it needed to. In an age where shows are dragged until completely decreased quality, this is a triumph. Gilligan chose wisely.

Crime does not pay but Breaking Bad certainly pays the price, thanks to the indescribable and unthinkable effort of the entire production anchored by a true discovery in television: Vince Gilligan. I doubt we'll see anything like this again."
10.0,19 May 2020,"Good, but kinda annoying at times.

Nagging women are totally annoying and make you wanna fast forward. But other than that quite ok but never a 9.5. Totally overrated!

Ah yes and the ending sucks!"
10.0,13 July 2020,"Can't say that it's bad or anything, but somehow it doesn't get me. I gave it multiple attempts because everyone keeps telling me that it is an amazing show, but it's doesn't take over my mind. It doesn't make me wanna watch te show for hours straight and do nothing else, so I'm still somewhere in the beginning of season 2. I think I just missed the trigger for this one."
10.0,1 August 2022,"Definitely worth your time, go watch it. Seriously, stop reading the reviews and go watch it. Such complex writing which allows you to dig deeper into the story.

Meticulously crafted characters plot and foreshadowing.

Important messages and subjects such as morality, mental health and addiction.

Characters that are extremely well written and 3 dimensional, who fulfil the roles intended for them by the writer.

Great score, acting and direction.

10/10 must watch."
10.0,30 July 2019,"When the greatnesses becomes series you will find breaking bad the best series ever the best characters , best director , best representation , best story and best end ."
10.0,1 March 2020,Such amazing screenplay and acting. Flawless in every aspect
6.0,16 October 2019,I have just watched this for the second time and found it just as addictive as first time round. Phenomenal from start to finish with a great cast and storyline that will blow your mind! You won't see another series like this in a very very long time.
4.0,14 October 2021,"Outstanding writing, with amazing characters and performances from the actors. A beautiful blend of realistic crime drama and dark comedy. Also some of the most unique cinematography I've ever seen in a show or movie. One of the greatest shows of all time!!"
10.0,16 March 2020,"This is hands down the best show ever made in Television history. Each and every character, situations are simply amazing. Finest piece of craftsmanship by the creators. Binge watched it twice till date.

From recording a panic message to ' I am the one who knocks'... The rise and fall of Hiesenberg! All bad things must come to an end"
8.0,11 April 2020,"Wonderful but Skyler & Ted relationship story is not good direction when Sky has a new born baby , its not tolerable . That is only negative point of this story , all over it is excellent . ."
10.0,21 April 2019,"This has to be quite simply the finest tv show of all time. A story that is expertly crafted, with so many unseen twists and turns. The most incredible production values and attention to detail. And the performance of Bryan Cranston? Simply the best acting performance of all time bar none. The arc of the story and the characters is utterly mesmerising. I loved every minute of this show and feel bereft that there is no more. Sensational"

10.0,4 May 2020,"Every person on earth should watch this TV show. If life didn't teach you a lesson, this TV show will. It's so beautiful and so amazing I just can't put it into words, I feel like I can rewatch it thousand times and not get bored of it. Everything is just awesome!"
10.0,18 April 2020,"The best movie I ever seen, and I have seen everything"
6.0,23 July 2021,All five seasons are beautiful There is a slowdown in the first seasons.
5.0,28 May 2020,My wife and I had heard all the hype and talk about Breaking Bad over the years but had never watched a single episode. We finally decided to watch a couple episodes to see if we liked it. 3 weeks later we had finished one of the best series we had ever seen. The writing was excellent as was the acting. We didnt want it to end. Walter White will go down as one of the great characters in the history of television. I just wish we had arrived to the party a little sooner. We didn't know what we were missing!
10.0,12 April 2022,"If this isnt a 10/10 what is? Simple as that, the show is perfect in all aspects every scene is perfect, this is peak television, this what a TV show should strive to be."
10.0,14 November 2021,"Breaking Bad has it all. Terrific episodes from starts to finish, there is not a bad episode. The story about Walter White is simply phenomenal. From the dialogue, to the characters and story, this show is in a league of its own,"
10.0,7 May 2019,"What a show breaking bad is. every season is a masterpiece and is amazing. the acting, directing, character development, plot everything is simply amazing. walter white is possibly the best tv character of all time."
10.0,17 February 2019,"Not too much I can say about breaking bad except it is the best show I have ever seen. Acting - perfect, characters - realistic and ones you really care about, story - always interesting, never cliche and always moving forward, music - outstanding, cinematography - breathtaking, overall concept - one of a kind. Breaking bad is a show that everyone should see."
10.0,23 August 2012,
10.0,20 July 2018,Okay it's good but it's overrated ! It does not deserve 9.5 /10 ... There a plenty of shows better than this ! Completely overrated
10.0,24 November 2021,"But I can't. It took two attempts to get through it. The second time was pure perseverance; only because I thought I should (and had a lot of time). It is boring. It just is. None of the characters are sympathetic. Some of them are interesting, but only in an 'I dislike them so much I hope they die soon' kind of way.

The acting is often good - sometimes very good (Bryan Cranston, Anna Gunn); sometimes not so good - Aaron (three Emmys) Paul. Changing volume and over-reacting is not acting.

Cranston, good as he was, winning awards ahead of Hugh Laurie's House is, frankly, silly.

If they had condensed the 62 episodes into 18 it may have been great. Or at least good. But no. Lingering shots of nothing. Taking eight seconds on a shot when two would have done. Repeatedly. Which may have been good if you were lingering on (e.g.) Scotland or Italy. Not Albuquerque. Although kudos for thinking you could get away with such a nothing of a location. (You could not, and did not, by the way).

There is a lot of self-satisfied editing, and a lot of self-satisfied direction.

If I was interested in such things I would have given it a 1 rating to drag it down. I am not. I would say - give at go. You may like it. Or, if you have never watched Buffy, Deadwood, The Sopranos, Father Ted, The Wire or The Leftovers maybe give them a go instead."
10.0,19 May 2020,"There's really not much more that can be said. This is the greatest TV show ever made. The writing is pure perfection. The acting, especially by Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul couldn't have been better, but even the other main characters, like Hank, Saul Goodman, and Gus were just phenomenally cast.

What every TV show needs to learn from breaking bad is that you don't need to have over the top dialogue or super emotional acting to create drama. The drama should come from the situation. The audience will pick up how serious or not a situation is through its context. This is where Vince Gilligan's genius comes from."
7.0,5 November 2016,
2.0,13 April 2022,"Ever since I saw Breaking Bad, I really can not enjoy a drama series as I used too. I really can not fathom what Vince Gilligan and his team created. I have never seen such complex and compelling characters in a series before, with wonderful character arcs and vast personalities. I really belive that every main character could have its own tv show (Better Call Saul is another masterpiece). Watching Walt evolving into Heisenberg in such natural way is --for me-- the greatest experience that tv can kffer. IT IS A MUST SEE!!!!

It has not one but two amazing season finale episodes, S4 and S5 and let us not forget ozzymandias, the most rated tv episode in IMDb."
10.0,31 December 2021,One of the greatest tv show ever put on air and great protagonist deuteragonist and antagonist Walter is such a badass at the end. I would definitely recommend this show. Season 1. 9/10 season 2. 9/10 season 3. 10/10 season 4 10/10 season 5. 11/10.
10.0,7 April 2019,
10.0,19 July 2021,"The first few seasons are top notch television, however where bb truly excels is in the last two seasons. This is where bb really separates its self from other shows by quite a margin. Never seen an ending so perfect to anything ever."
10.0,27 February 2020,The single greatest television show ever created. There is no argument and this is no opinion. It's a fact. There is nothing I can say about the excellence of this show that hasn't already been said. Good day sir.
10.0,14 July 2023,"In my opinion, this series is the best in the last half century. The story is very interesting and has subtle complications and it is somehow one of the countless strengths of this series. In the acting department, all the actors did their work perfectly as if these roles were made for them, even In this movie, the actors who play the role of a nerve-wrecker really did a great job of being a nerve-wrecker. All these strengths undoubtedly brought positive feedback from the people so that many like me consider this series the best series of the last half century and always learn from it as a masterpiece."
9.0,15 February 2021,"This was boring show, with lots of murders of good characters. I did not find any acting or emotions or music or visual part i.e. there were nothing entertaining or touching. I kept watching only because of two characters but when they got killed I realized that the show became empty. My favorite episode is the last one when this is all ended in proper way.

Also, what is the lesson learned from this? If you have a crisis of middle age, you need to become a criminal instead of trying to find support in your family and make some efforts to improve your life?"
10.0,28 June 2023,"The show is solid. The acting is incredible at times and the standard is high throughout the show. Although the last few seasons are great the first 3-4 seasons I thought where quite dull with a lot of just boring dialogue and plot lines. Which is why I struggle to give it higher than a 6. I struggled to get through the first few seasons. It was genuinely really tough to get through some of the episodes and seasons.

I think the fact that the show has such a high rating overall and how people speak so highly of it may have impacted my feeling towards it, as I was expecting of course a real masterpiece from start to finish which it definitely is not. Was left disappointed with the show."
10.0,1 September 2013,
6.0,9 January 2023,"Bryan Cranston as Walter White truly delivers in this series masterpiece about a science teacher, diagnosed with a terminal illness who is looking towards other ways to make an income. That way being... manufacturing meth.

It leads down some dark and dangerous paths and his relationship with Jessie Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul is nothing short of beautiful. It's a stressful show to watch as Walter deals with some less than savory characters and as you can imagine, finds himself in prickly situations.

The series is captivating and tragic. There's not a single dull moment with major kudos to the writers and directors. 10/10."
2.0,27 July 2021,"Breaking bad is without a doubt the best television show i've ever seen. Everything about it is amazing. Part of what makes breaking bad so good is it's consistency, the show gets better every season, something that other shows sometimes struggle with. It started out good and kept getting better, there weren't any weak moments in my opinion. The premise itself already sets it up to be an excellent show. The finale is by far the best i've seen, everything was wrapped up and came to a satisfying conclusion. However, breaking bad's greatest strength is the writing. The attention to detail is astounding and the character development is top notch. You feel so strongly about wanting to see certain characters succeed or fail, and the entire show is honestly an emotional rollercoaster because you're unsure about who you should root for! But you really can't talk about breaking bad without mentioning the acting. Every character, big or small, is acted out so well and you become so invested in their stories.

I'm not gonna lie, it took me a little while to get into this show as I didn't like season 1 very much the first time around (granted, this was a few years ago). I decided to pick it up again back in October and I'm very glad that I did. The episode that really sold it for me was S2E8 ""Better Call Saul"", and after that I really couldn't stop watching. And if you still aren't hooked on it by then, just wait until the last few episodes of season 4. Breaking bad is depressing, violent, and sometimes hard to stomach, but it is the most compelling show I've ever watched."
10.0,31 July 2021,"Best characters, best character motivations, pretty much every scene is memorable, extreme attention to detail, and perfect balance of comedy and drama. If you haven't seen this show yet then you're then you're missing out."
10.0,17 May 2020,10/10 fantastic tv show would highly recommend to watch
10.0,20 November 2022,
10.0,17 April 2021,"In my opinion, and many others as well, this is the best show ever created. I think it will be a long time until we have a show that maintains this level of quality and realism from the first to the last episode. The way it builds momentum and connects puzzle pieces is unlike any other show I have seen, and every time I rewatch I find another reason its so highly rated. So many of these characters have a brilliant arc that makes them so real and easy to connect with. Vince Gilligan is so good at presenting something in a casual way that seems irrelevant, but could actually be an enormous plot point later down the line. And because these things are done in such a realistic way, they go right over your head, until Vince is ready to pull them back into play."
10.0,24 May 2019,Probably the only show I've ever watched start to finish 3 times.. probably the best t.v series to ever air period! I'd rate 11/10 if I could!
10.0,6 August 2023,"Straight to the point: maybe the BEST series ever made. Not only the casting is supreme, not only you don't see the twists, not only you think that you know what will happen, who will die when (and you get to be sorely mistaken), but literary EVERYTHING. Characters are DEEP, not only 2-3 main ones, but ALL of them. The dialogues are supreme, there is no unneccesary grandioze-but-empty monologues... Only thing you will NOT find here is eye-bluring and mind-boggling special efects. From the top of my mind, I think the biggest effects are few explosions, and pistol firing.

All in all, this series prooves, beyond reasonable doubt, that a great scenario and great writer beats best Hollywood special effects team in every occasion.

Personally ,top 6: Breaking bad, Wire, West Wing, Chernobil, Silicon Valley and Expanse are 6 series you have to watch before you die."
10.0,25 April 2021,"Throughout the whole show Jesse is yelling, like stfu bro that's overdoing it."
10.0,27 December 2023,
6.0,30 May 2019,"Dosn't have the power to keep my attention at all, i expected better."
10.0,23 April 2021,"So instead of reading this review, go watch it for the 10th time."
10.0,23 March 2009,"This is a great show. First of all the look of the show is just absolutely outstanding. It has this greenish-yellow tint to it that makes the desert scenes all the more gritty and hot. You can really feel the heat from those scenes. The acting is without question movie-quality. In fact, the whole show has this movie feel that can only be described as a mini-movie for TV (not a TV movie though). I love the fact the show perpetuates drama in the most ordinary circumstances. Only The Sopranos came close to the balance that Breaking Bad has with its story lines. Altogether, Breaking Bad is the next greatest thing to Meth!"
10.0,1 August 2022,"Great show with phenomenal writing. The characters are so well done. When you actually put the time and effort into writing something truly great, you will get something truly great. Everything about the show is really good. Although some big episodes didn't hit me as much as I wanted them to, I still loved it.

9/10."
10.0,5 February 2021,"I saw some of the 1 star reviewers and I have to say, those folks must be really dull to be around! It's obvious they didn't even watch it. The show is so intense and edge of your seat especially when it really gets going.. very smart writing because of the character development"
10.0,18 June 2021,"For me Breaking Bad is not a show it is a feeling, an emotion every time i rewatch it instead of getting bored i get more excited instead sitting through it I watch every second of it feeling everything the characters feel every time I finish watching it I feel an emptiness that I have never felt in my real life so how could this be a show how could I be so connected to something that is not real well to me it is real to me it is an emotion."
10.0,17 July 2023,"Breaking Bad is by far the best series Every sequence has been thought out and everything in this series has turned out very well I wish I could erase my memory and watch this series from the beginning without any background.

Number 1 in the word , i thank Vince Gilligan and bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and All other cast on this Good Job thanks To Amc Breaking Bad.

Breaking Bad is the best TV Show of all time in my opinion. The story, characters and their growth are second to none. Do watch!

Without doubt the best drama series evere.memorable acting,great writing,awsome crew and a high class production team created Breaking Bad as well."
10.0,9 August 2022,This is literally the greatest show of all time. I won't be taking any questions at this time and if you disagree with me then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.
10.0,31 January 2023,"As far as television shows go, nothing will ever top the masterpiece that is Breaking Bad. This show excells in so many areas it's crazy, start off with the characters for instance, the acting in this show is phenomenal, I loved every second I spent watching that I even dived into Better Call Saul & El Camino.

The character development is insane, we meet Walter Hartwell White, a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer, its so interesting watching a shy push over man turn into a drug kingpin. Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul absolutely killed it. I have to say though Mike will always be my favourite of all, what a character.

I'd highly recommend this, it's absolutely insane."
6.0,9 January 2015,
10.0,1 February 2021,"One of the best shows i ever watched. Great characters, plot and overall an amazing venture into a humans psyche. Almost beats GOT season 8 in depth and attention to detail. Absolute must watch!"
10.0,19 April 2020,"This was an ok show, but it clearly has problems with characterization of the main characters, unlike family guy, a show with amazing characters and with groundbreaking racial commentary. This show is clearly a ripp off of the best family guy episode: peter sells meth together with his earlier student from science class(brian the dog from family guy)(brilliant episode)."
10.0,24 May 2019,Man how could someone think like what Vince Gilligan has done. His mastermind has payed off. And the cast who made it possible deserves a huge respect. The whole team deserves a golden statue in Albuquerque. Best tv series I have ever watched in my life. There will never be a tv series that can break BREAKING BAD.
10.0,7 March 2021,"I've been meaning to watch this series in its entirety and got glimpses of it through the 'Lessons from the Screenplay' YouTube channel - I binged on the channel during Covid-19 lockdown in 2020 and started writing my first TV series during that time.

I personally think this is one compelling piece of work and I can't wait until I get to a place where I create better TV than this."
10.0,28 May 2020,The best series ever hands down. No series even comes close.
9.0,17 May 2020,"The best show that exists.. Outstanding writing, brilliant direction and a bundle of excellent performances. Bryan Cranston was gobsmaking throughout."
10.0,21 November 2022,
10.0,25 May 2019,Breaking Bad is by far the best show of all time. The drama. The character development. The acting. The build up. The suspense. Everything about it is just perfect!
6.0,14 May 2021,"Best series I have ever seen. I don't expect other than 10 ratings point for this series. Acting and direction top notch. I would request to ppl out there who have not watched it yet, plz watch it you wont be disappointed."
5.0,30 October 2023,
10.0,14 September 2014,"OH my god, a show never put me this much on edge before... and made me cry for near death of a supporting character. I never watched anything so real in my life, and I can fully understand why critics and everyone say this show is number one. Breaking Bad, I recommend this show to anyone. The writing is flawless and superb, it deters away from any writer's flaws. It has left me on edge every season wanting more. It does not leave you hanging, questions are answered in the same episode nearly. I honestly don't know if I can watch anything else without complaining about how faulty the scripting is. If you haven't watched the show, please do, it'll be the best thing you have ever watched in your whole life."
10.0,4 July 2012,
10.0,22 May 2019,"Boring , and i think the whole story can be presented in 3 or 2 seasons"
10.0,24 January 2020,"This review could go on for ever and ever. Not only would I not change a single second of Breaking Bad, but, I can say without question that I will never, ever watch anything that comes close to it. Perfection, legend, words that are way over used. But yet these words mean nothing when describing Breaking Bad! Simply the best there ever was and ever will be."
10.0,6 August 2021,You dont want to know what things i would do to watch it for the first time again.
10.0,5 May 2019,I can not describe how i felt sad when it ends. Vince Gilligan is a genius. I've never seen such talented actors like Aaron Paul & Bryan Cranston. Suggest you see.
10.0,4 September 2020,I have watched BB all the way through 4 or 5 times now. Always fantastic. Best show ever put on TV. Wish it could've lasted forever.
10.0,22 February 2022,"I really believe that this how is a 100/10 best show i have ever watched without a doubt in my mind. The writing of this show is incredible and the character development is out of this world, i think heizenberg i an interesting character, and feels like the mind of the show, where as the heart and soul of this show is following the story of jesse pinkman, his ups and downs, and how wonderful of a story he has. Best show i have ever watched to date."
6.0,24 August 2021,"Breaking Bad is by far the best show I have ever seen. This series has twists and turns throughout, and can get incredibly intense. The final episodes of the show will leave you thinking about how you will never watch anything as good as what you just saw. It has shocking scenes all over, incredible acting, amazing writing, and a phenomenal story line."
3.0,19 May 2020,"I have always been a just & fair guy in all my dealings. I am a really soft spoken person who handles aggrevating situations with a massive smile on my face. London time 8:15am I just realized I haven't left a review for the only show truly worthy of being called a masterpiece.

Let me assure you I am a really hard to please guy so much so it took over 7 years for family & friends to convince me to finally give Breaking Bad a go. When I got to season 5 I turned it off & decided to make some phone calls. I called four friends & two relatives. I told them off big time! Yes thats exactly what happened I said 'whats wrong with you people you said BB was good'. Upon which 3 of them replied 'ye...ya....ye'es?! AND?!' Then they heard the near impossible excitement in my voice. All I said was you guys kept saying its good but you should have used wordings like: best ever, incredible, a masterpiece, life changing, one of a kind, 100/10* etc etc

This show is so good there should be another list here for shows like these. Problem is this will be the only show in that special list as nothing even remotely comes close. And nothing ever will. Start to finish its simply extraordinary. A masterpiece. A stunning work of art.

Everyone should watch it regardless of the genre preference. Trust me you'll be doing yourselves a favour

Perfection on every level. Its madness because I literally struggle to watch many other shows. They just seem to lack what BB had. Perfection

Its not just a tv show its an opportunity. An opportunity to witness the greatest show ever crafted. Absolutely a must see!"
10.0,24 July 2021,Started this show as a time pass but it is very much addictive due to its terrific character development and story progression hands down one of the best series.
10.0,21 December 2023,"Breaking Bad, a cinematic masterpiece, unfolds the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher into a ruthless drug lord. Vince Gilligan's storytelling is a symphony of tension and moral complexity, weaving a narrative that explores the darkest corners of the human psyche. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of White is a tour de force, capturing the evolution with haunting authenticity. The cinematography paints Albuquerque with both beauty and decay, mirroring the moral decay of its characters. Breaking Bad stands as a testament to the power of character development, moral ambiguity, and the consequences of choices, solidifying its place in the pantheon of television excellence."
10.0,24 September 2021,God his wife Skylar is absolute torture.. i mean TORTURE!!!
10.0,11 May 2019,"I know this show is one of the most popular shows ever, but I don't get why.

I mean, is it just me, or is this show super boring?

I binge watched up to the second episode of the second season, after the third or fourth was already out. The video buffered half way through the episode, and realised I didn't care how the episode ended.

I'd only lasted that long because I like Bryan Cranston.

After the show was already over, I had nothing to do, so I binged up to the last season. I didn't bother watching the last 5 or 6 episodes and don't plan to.

Instead I just YouTubed the last 5 minutes and called it done.

The whole show was just 5 minutes (in a ""good"" episode) of something happening and 40 of stretched out filler, and whole scenes where literally nothing is said or done..

As far as I can tell, every episode is: nothing happens, nothing happens, something happens for 2 minutes, Jessie screws it up, then nothing happens, nothing happens, credits."
10.0,13 April 2020,"Simply could be the best thing I've ever seen. Even I could imagine that existed, I wouldn't imagine that much. I don't know how I was mature when this was released and I didn't watch it. Thanks a lot Breaking Bad."
10.0,1 August 2019,"After watching this series for the 5th time, I would still concider this the greatest TV-show ever created."
10.0,10 August 2019,"Breaking Bad is the greatest tv show of all time, with not a bad episode, performance, plot line or anything. This is a perfect show! Bryan Cranston gives the best performance I've seen an actor give and Aaron Paul gives the second best! The series finale is the best finale the show could've had, the entire show goes in ways you don't expect but are so glad happen! Breaking Bad is perfect!!"
6.0,15 June 2009,"Alongside Mad Men, Breaking Bad is probably one of the best TV series out to date. The cinematography and storytelling are topnotch, surpassing the quality of many films.

Characters range from the quirky to the downright sinister. Bryan Cranston from Malcolm in the Middle dissolves completely into his role. He has an everyman likability that continues even as his character descends into inhumanity. The believability of the situation is vital to the show, and all of the other actors do an excellent job of maintaining it.

Stylistically, it's a bit reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, there are certain changes from episode to episode which make things more interesting.

It'd be ideal to start watching it from the beginning, however any one episode will pull you quickly into the story. Sometimes there is a weak plot point here or there, but its makes the show all the more unpredictable. As I watched BB I discovered foreshadowing, subtle messages, symbolism, and moral dilemmas which I won't go into detail here.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a unique show packed with humor, action, and drama that will appeal to a wide audience. The storytelling, though, is always central, as it should be."
10.0,16 May 2021,"Its sad that every crime drama i watch now, i can't stop my self to compare with this. This show just sets the bar high."
9.0,20 May 2021,"Updated.

Stick to this series! S1 AND S2 will bore you out (it's still true that a few episodes could be squeezed into 1) but come S3, things just got more exciting and episodes have become more interesting to watch. What I like about the series is a VERY SOLID storyline. Simple and not that complex thus giving opportunity for an elaborate plot."
10.0,30 September 2013,"Breaking bad is one of it's kind. Perfect story ,perfect way to show the story. Perfect acting ,perfect directing. Great ending. I can watch this series again and again and it will stay the best. I recommend people to stop wasting their time and watch the most perfect series of all time in my opinion. Thanks Vince for this amazing show and i hope every creator to learn from breaking bad. Also, Bryan was absolutely stunning and he was perfect for the role ,Anna gunn deserved the Emmy And all the casting crew was great.Also,the choosing of characters is brilliant. PEOPLE !!! Don't miss this show, it's the best. It's 10/10 perfection."
10.0,15 April 2020,"There are tons of reviews, it touched everyone in a different way according to their mind set. It touched me with a vibrating push I believe there has to be something more than just some entertaining entertainment, something that touches you deep down, improves your insight toward life to send your mind into a mission to your own depths to see for yourself that who you are in this world and where is your life escalating to. Enjoy it, ten stars out of ten."
10.0,21 March 2023,"This sixty episode journey is a story with deep character development, tense action and a plot that comes with surprising twists and superb conclusions. Paired with awesome performance by actors it had everything it needed to leave a permanent mark in the TV history.

And in fact it quite often did live up to its potential. It lives up to it for the better part of 2nd season and ending of the 3rd; but its from the second half of the 4th season that it is pure joy to engage with it - only then it finally reached its full potential and that's where you will find all of the things that i had praised it for in the first paragraph.

But while more often than not the first 3 seasons were given from me ratings varying from 7s up to a couple of 10s. It does encounter some mediocre episodes. While they develop characters for their stories to be pushed further, i couldn't get a feeling that they were ""slow"" and lacked in action.

And while i absolutely love s05 with my average episode rating at 9,38 for it, i would feel guilty to overlook episodes that left me bored and discouraged form visiting the next one.

If you are considering giving this series a shot - don't expect it to be perfect from the get go, but give it some time and you won't regret it!"
10.0,16 April 2020,"Well, It's good. It's kind of slow and suspenseful. But there are some flaws at some points where I can say it's not making any sense. I had different mind at some episodes which a thought I am gonna hate this but end of this show, was kind of sentimental.

The characters that I want to talk about, Walt's character was little selfish which I was assuming at some point. Jesse Pink, yo! I loved this guy, his acting is just remarkable and amazing, I have heard that he never went to the acting school, and he really excellent actor for sure. Aaron Paul is brilliant actor. As a drug addict, he nailed it. There is a genuine acting of Skyler White, which I loved it. Gustavo Fring, the man of honor, the man of well disciplined, I really loved this guy, the way he acted was just authentic.

It could have ended just after the season 05 episode 01, this is where it should have ended because it all seemed over in that episode.

Just good show, but not my favourite, it is seeming to me that it's overrated because I don't think it should be ratted 9.5/10 and there are many flaws. Like that threat video to Hank, Walt not giving money to Jesse; his half share.

After all the fuss, like getting rid from Tuco and his cousins and then from the Gustavo as he didn't deserve that, it could have ended right after that, but what...after killed Gustavo, Walt just stated to cook again???After all been in such death troubles, he still wants to cook again??I didn't admire that. It seemed little motiveless at such points. Well, it was good and just good."
10.0,7 August 2020,Actor gives overreaction everytime. Main character has a stupid mind. He make every decision wrong. How the hell ratings are this high?
9.0,19 July 2015,"I, like many people, refused to watch ""Breaking Bad"" for the sole reason that I also erroneously believed it was a show about drug culture. What made it worse for me was that it was about what I believe to be worst of drug scourges in methamphetamines which proliferate within our underground to destroy so many lives. Having gone through own rebellious stages as a youth and experimenting with mind altering substances, I feel fortunate to have indulged in a time when artificial chemicals were not as prevalent as they are today.

I already had, through these early years, experienced enough of the subculture to recognize how the descriptive term of ""seedy"" is an understatement. It is a world rife with opportunistic exploitation and bereft of integrity in the pursuit of profit within a market so large, the challenge for players is no longer one of simple revenue generation but of market dominance often established through violent means. Few players can be considered to have evolved any appreciable measure of EQ.

I already had experienced enough of drug culture both in real life and in the sensationalized forms of fictional entertainment to believe I was no longer interested in being exposed to yet another example of either superficial glamorization or agenda bashing pedantry. I erroneously believed the premise of a high school teacher turning to the world of drugs due to economic conditions had already been done with ""Weeds"". (As much as I enjoyed some aspects of that show, it seemed to struggle between comedy and drama in a way which made it difficult for me to maintain faith as a viewer. I didn't want to find myself experiencing the same initial interest dwindling into an experience where I stopped caring about what was happening. Now that that show has completed its run, I may return to it in binge form - which might help me overcome the challenges it faced by being delivered on a weekly basis. I think some shows fail precisely because pacing is a challenge to maintain in storytelling when one must wait weeks or months to keep fresh the bond which exists between character and audience.) ""Breaking Bad"" didn't abate in either its popularity or in the zeal demonstrated by fans I encountered. Over the years of its run, it seemed as if fans were increasingly devoted toward gluing themselves to their seats as each episode was released. Eventually, I relented in the last year of its run and binged upon it with only a few months before its conclusion. I consider this perhaps one of the wisest television watching decisions I have ever made. I believe the experience of binge watching a show far transcends the experience of a weekly ceremonial because like a book, one can enjoy it from start to finish with fewer interruptions and far less lag between chapters. This freedom is what allows the mind to become absorbed by fiction in a way which transforms one's consciousness in ways unavailable to a weekly hour long ritual punctuated by distracting and often mind-numbing crass commercialism.

I believe the new format of releasing entire seasons at one go that some production companies have adopted is a thin entering wedge transforming television from being an ""idiot box"" to superficially satiate transient escapism needs and establish new heights on a bar of storytelling achievement. ""Breaking Bad"" is a show, which may have garnered a loyal following by being released on a weekly basis over years, but that is a testament to its exceptionally high degree of quality.

Watching it in binge fashion like I did was a transformative experience. As an audience member, one cannot help but to ponder the lessons learned from truly understanding how our choices shape both our reality and the person we become.

Walter White's initial decision to care for his family's future by turning toward drug production to mitigate the destabilizing effects of a career as a teacher shortened by the threat of death by the scourge of cancer was presented as a rational decision. This was a man who loved his family and whose sole desire to fulfill his economic responsibility as a father preparing their children with the requisites to create a successful future life for themselves, was an honourable goal. One empathized with his initial decision.

Throughout the course of this show's run, one perpetually finds oneself supporting his decisions even though many of the early ones resulted in consequences any conscientious human being would struggle with. The taking of a life for instance cannot be viewed as an acceptable outcome unless one's own life is threatened. For most people who encounter such a harsh reality, this is an anomalous experience. For those who traffic in the underground world of criminally generated profit, this is an unfortunately far from rare encounter. We may find this world abhorrent for this reason, but we accept the reality of its nature.

When we see a school teacher struggling to come to terms with this aspect of their choice, we support his actions on the basis of what has already been established as an honourable motivation. We rationalize the taking of a life as an unfortunate but necessary consequence.

What makes ""Breaking Bad"" unique however, is that we march headlong with Walter down the the slippery slope of diluted ethics to discover our empathy with the main character being transformed into revulsion. This is an experience which forces us to consider where, in the spectrum of acceptable standards of living, would we say ""enough"". At which point in our journey of devolving humanity do we stop and reclaim what we've allowed to erode within our spirit. No other show has ever so successfully challenged an audience on this deepest level of our own humanity.

""Breaking Bad"" is a testament to storytelling which will survive as a beacon of quality for generations to come."
7.0,21 October 2019,"No movies even come close to this challenging, mind and soul bending, character study of various mobsters converging in the most desperate times to an intricate climax where truth will be revealed that echoes into eternity.

Greatest piece of film art in three decades, hands down. You have to go back to Pulp Fiction in 1994 to find something this unique, original, yet competent enough to become a legit masterpiece.

All Hail the King."

10.0,3 June 2021,"This is the best series I have ever watched. It is perfectly written. The tension is spot on and it has meaningful substance. A lot of show writers can learn from this show. It's just impressive. Give it a chance and you'll see what everyone else is talking about.

Honestly... if you don't think this is a fantastically well written show then you have horrible horrible taste in television quality period. I completely understand everyone has their own opinions but I draw the line when it comes to Breaking Bad when someone tells me it's ""boring"" or ""overrated"". How someone can write a bad review on this show is beyond my understanding. It's literally the best goddamn show I have ever watched. And I've finished a lot of shows in my down time. They couldn't have ended it any more brilliantly. Especially after all that amazing build up."
10.0,18 February 2019,"This is it. This is the peak of television, nay, this is the peak of the entire film industry. Never will there be anything like Breaking Bad on the screen ever again. It is to this day, and always will be, the best Tv-series of all time.

I could go into detail about all the things that are good with this show, but I fear then this review would be endless. But the most astonishing thing about Breaking Bad is its attention to detail. The creators, writers, and directors are pure geniuses, how they can even come up with all these impregnated details and foreshadowings is beyond me. As astonishing is the acting, from Giancarlo Esposito and Byran Cranston to Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn, every single performance is spot on, and Cranston's is out of this world - more than deservedly winning him 4 Emmy's and a Golden Globe.

To spot flaws in this series, one would need an electron microscope. I'm not even sure then if you could find any. It is like the Mona Lisa of Tv - infact, the Louvre should replace her with a painting of Walter White. Flawless, absolutely flawless, I cannot put into words how good this show is.

Everyone who hasn't seen this, must see it before they die. Everyone who has seen it - watch it again."
10.0,16 May 2019,Nobody can say that game of thrones is better Just look at season 8 What a joke Breaking bad WON and will be the most loved show ever
10.0,13 October 2011,"For the first time ever I'm writing a review, just because the impact of this show. I don't like watching episodes weekly at all, I just wait until a blu ray becomes available. Not this time ! Had to see it right away every week. Watched many very good shows like Sopranos, True Blood, Dexter but this show is on top ! The perfect match between a superb storyline, stunning camera-work and soundtrack and most of all very, very impressive actors. Never watch TV shows a second time, but this show makes the exception. Really looking forward to buy the blu rays of all 4 seasons. I hope there will be a 5th season !! I'm very critical in spending time behind the TV. But Breaking Bad was every season high quality time. I envy people who are going to watch the show for the first time...you lucky guys !"
10.0,28 January 2020,"Most TV series exist in a state of enforced stasis, minor changes to the status quo and a character death here and there keep might keep things fresh but ultimately as a viewer you might watch them on an episode to episode basis without thinking too far ahead. There are however a select few series which have set out trying to tell a complete unified story in which every event has a bearing on the overall picture of the tale, and everything from episode one to the finale might feel planned. I'd include Game of thrones, Mr Robot, The Americans etc. in this category. This means that you get this sense of falling further and further down the rabbit hole as you watch each episode. For creators, this is the hardest thing to pull off, it must take incredible discipline and patience. To this day I'd argue that there's only one TV series that has achieved this huge novelistic structure without losing momentum or going astray at some point in its long run. I am of course talking about Breaking Bad. From the first episode Breaking Bad knows what it's about and from there on it unfolds like a great big pulpy novel. Each season doesn't end in a finale which wraps things up only for the story to have to find a new beginning in it's next outing, but instead ends with just an episode (Invariably an incredible one) that raises the stakes for the next season and subtlety moves the story into the next act in a way that feels natural. There's a beginning, a middle and an end. And the protagonist's arc is clearly sign posted all the way through to the story's astounding, devastating final act.

When you reach the end of Breaking Bad you feel as though you've completed a long journey in the best way possible. Few series (or even movies for that matter) can match it for being just so stuffed with artistic craft. Everything is just tip top from the writing to the acting. Even while the visuals may not be able to match some of the bigger budget blockbuster series like game of thrones or Westworld for shear spectacle, they are instead meticulous in their creativity in a way those other series don't quite match. We're treated to beautiful wide angle shots of an omnipresent New Mexico desert, but also with close ups of little details most showrunners would simply ignore. Attention to these details is perhaps the thing which makes breaking bad so compelling. I personally always loved the look of the show for its grainy, high contrast, natural lighting style of cinematography. It's notably shot on film in a world increasingly turning to the clear look of digital. This all (alongside directing which is always imaginative) helps to bring out a wild western pulpy quality reminiscent of the work of Leone or Tarantino.

There a few series I hold closer to my heart than all the rest (The Leftovers, The Sopranos, Twin Peaks, Mad Men etc.), but still, 7 years after I finished Breaking Bad, it remains my ultimate TV experience and the only series I've seen that never put so much as a foot wrong over its 5 season run. I recommend giving it the most cinematic viewing you can. Find a big screen with a good sound system and settle in for a rare top to bottom TV masterpiece."
10.0,14 July 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is often hailed as one of the greatest television series of all time, but a closer look reveals several aspects that warrant a more modest rating of 6/10.

Firstly, the series' pacing can be problematic. While the slow burn approach builds tension, it often feels overly drawn out. Some episodes seem to meander without advancing the plot significantly, which can test the patience of viewers who prefer a more consistently engaging narrative.

Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston, is a complex character, but his transformation from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord can feel forced at times. The rapid escalation of his actions sometimes lacks the subtlety needed to make his descent entirely believable. This can lead to moments where character decisions seem driven more by the need for dramatic effect than by authentic development.

The show's portrayal of moral ambiguity, while compelling, can also be heavy-handed. The constant oscillation between right and wrong, good and evil, becomes repetitive. The series often revisits the same ethical dilemmas, which can make it feel like it is treading water rather than exploring new ground.

Supporting characters, while well-acted, often fall into archetypal roles. Skyler White, played by Anna Gunn, frequently becomes a focal point of frustration for viewers, not necessarily due to the character's actions but because of the way her storyline is handled. Similarly, characters like Hank Schrader and Jesse Pinkman, despite their depth, often revert to predictable patterns that can diminish their impact.

The show's visual style, though striking, can sometimes be overly stylized, detracting from the narrative. The frequent use of dramatic camera angles and stylistic flourishes can feel self-indulgent, drawing attention away from the story and towards the show's aesthetic choices.

Furthermore, the series' treatment of its female characters has been a point of contention. Critics argue that they are often sidelined or portrayed in a less favorable light compared to their male counterparts. This imbalance can undermine the show's attempt to present a fully realized world.

In conclusion, while ""Breaking Bad"" has its moments of brilliance and boasts strong performances, particularly from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, it is not without significant flaws. Its pacing issues, sometimes forced character development, repetitive moral quandaries, and occasional stylistic excesses warrant a more critical view. Thus, despite its acclaim, ""Breaking Bad"" merits a 6/10 for its uneven execution and overrated status."
10.0,14 June 2020,"From the first time i watched it, i've been thinking to watch it more. Really love this series, it's masterpiece from the cinematography, acting, character, also the moral lesson. After i watched it, i'm awake to make my own choices. Also, i've learned something from this series which is a person can change in any circumstances and we can't adjudicate without knowing the cause."
10.0,3 January 2021,"I came late to BB so gorged on it for a week in bed at nights It's all been said, but I don't expect to see anything this good ever again Every time I watch something that everyone is raving about, I always find myself comparing it to BB. Always unfavourably. I have resisted the temptation to watch it again for 5 years, but it won't be long before I just have to."
7.0,7 January 2020,"Breaking Bad is one those TV programmes that is hyped up immensely and yet lives up to all the hype. From the genius of Vince Gilligan to the sublime performances from Bryan Cranston (in particular) and co., this show just manages to get everything right. You will not regret watching it."

10.0,5 July 2019,"Prison Break and GOT is a joke compared to this one. It had everything: Insane acting, Great story, Killing, brutal scenes, you name it. It was so addicting I couldnt stop watch it! I almost never ate or slept! I re-watched it once and it was just as good as the first time! actually I could re-watch it 10 times more if I had the time. 2008 what a great year!"

10.0,19 December 2010,"I like to look at the pace of this show as that of life itself. It's hard (as I've read by other reviewers) for most to like Jesse as a character; Jesse honestly is just that type of character. I recommend you don't judge him, and accept that the character development will fill in the blanks, as does the acting. Take it or leave it, this show is ""arts"" in all meaning of the word. It's an amazing show and it has my recommendation for any who are interested! It is very intense, and it's moral issue scenarios are very unique, and very realistic.

For these facts, this show is set apart from any other I've seen. The newer shows like Miami Vice and Ncis: LA fall so very short to the cinematography and complexity of this wonderful piece of television (or to put it in my opinion, a long, extenuated silver screen movie, mainly due to the acting). Give it a try, you'll never regret it!

Easily a 10 star review! Two thumbs way, way up! **********!"
10.0,1 December 2021,"I tried so many times to watch breaking bad that too in fast forward mode and couldnt get past season 2 and ultimately saw the last episode and nothing changed. I was complete able to understand it. I watched Malcolm in the middle and hated bryan cranston. After watching breaking bad my opinion hasnt changed at all. Still dont like him. The acting is sub par and the story is too slow, long, overdrawn and boring. Also very unbelievable that a chemistry teacher becomes a kingpin and is able to kill so many feard drug dealers easily. Classic case of ""The emperor has no clothes"". Too many deluded fans or people who pretend to like it."

7.0,11 January 2020,"I watched Breaking Bad last month for the first time. For years I had heard that it's a great show but somehow I could not bring myself to watch it. So I decided to give it a chance when I saw it on Netflix. And I'm so glad that I did it. Great acting, flawless scenario and implementation of it. I can't imagine how refreshing this was when it first started to air years ago. As many people say here; watch it asap, thank later. This might be the best show I ever seen or maybe it already is. The only disadvantage you may have is that you won't be satisfied with any other TV show. Ever!!! :) But you're already been warned."
5.0,16 May 2019,"Pretty much as the title says, best of all time. I had watched exactly 63 TV shows. Many of them I had finished and a few were boring I was unable to finish, however I finished Breaking Bad 3 times , with literally the same amount of excitement each time. Thank you so much Vince, Bryan, Aaron, Anna, Betsy, RJ, Dean, Bob, Jonathan and most importantly the one who portrayed my favorite villain of all time Giancarlo. This show will forever be in my heart."

10.0,27 May 2016,
10.0,27 February 2022,"I hate to say it. The first 2 seasons were great. Obviously, this series peaked when Saul had the most screen time. It started jumping the shark in S3. Then it jumped more than a half-dozen species of sharks by the end of S4. Tiger, leopard, bull, sand, great white, you name it, it jumped them all.

I'd actually love to sit down and watch S3 & S4 with someone who calls this ""brilliant"". What a hoot that would be. There must be a S5? I guess I'll try to watch it.

The other problem: it even stopped trying to be funny over time. Surely Saul was the main source of comedy, but it had some other moments in S1 & S2, but by the end of S4, they just turned the ""drama"" and the coincidence and the plain STUPID decisions up to ""11"". And, not surprisingly, the more ridiculous it got, the higher the imdb rating got."
10.0,3 October 2022,"Fargo and House of Cards have been my favorite shows, and watching this up to season 4, I still did not rate this as high as them. Then there is season 5.

Now after watching everything. Breaking Bad is truly untouchable. SEASON 5 left me so impressed that I have to say, no show will ever Breaking the Badass barrier like this show. If there ever is a show that is the best show I ve watched in my life time, this is it. Nothing else I watch in the future will ever be this good.

There is only one mountain that will is the highest in the world, it is Mount Everest.

There is only one mountain in TV that is the highest in the world, it's Mount Heisenberg.

Now I ve climbed it, I say that it has been a real privilege getting to the highest TV peak. I m forever grateful that I got to watch Breaking Bad. It is an eternal gift that I will treasure the rest of my life."

10.0,11 June 2021,"As far as television series goes, I can genuinely not think of one that is better quality than this. The writing for one is absolutely genius, and Vince Gilligan deserves to be crowned for his efforts. Every bloody corner has something you don't expect, and given that I just finished my second viewing in 4 years, it is remarkable that I am still shocked second guessing every one. The acting, filmmaking, production, editing - perfection. I knew this was good before though, but now that I've grown older and uglier, and (likes to think) I've developed a more critical outlook when viewing films and TV, it's easily more than double as good as I remember. Also just sad that there isn't a thriller out there that comes close, but oh well, will have to return in 4 years time and write another review. True masterpiece."

Be aware that because 'Breaking Bad' will most likely, leave you with a sense of permanent nostalgia for the show you may need to rewatch it or find a surrogate as the prequel ""Better Call Saul"" to fill the gap after its finished.

10.0,4 February 2022,"I just... I tried. I gave it till halfway through season 3 and I couldn't take it anymore. Nothing. Ever. Happens. And everything is constantly dragged out.

Conversations go on and on and on while adding nothing to the plot nor character development. The camera slowly pans over the most mundane, random thing in the scene just to make the show longer.

I hate all the characters too. The only good thing about this show is the premise and the acting. I've heard that seasons 4 and 5 are the best, so perhaps I'll come back to try those someday and update this review.

But god. This has got to be the most boring, overrated show I've ever seen.

Update: I finished the show. Seasons 4 and 5 were much better. I feel like if the writers condensed the show down to 3 seasons, it wouldn't have had such slow pacing and drag on at times.

Seriously I'm still annoyed that a lot of the first few seasons focused on them sitting there staring into space. There are better ways to develop characters."

I never really have time for shows but oh boy, I won't regret taking the time to watch this masterpiece. It really is one of the most brilliant, well thought out scripts in the history of television. Every character/actor does a great job as well. I totally disagree with the people saying it started out slow (some of my friends also said the same) I thought it started with a bang right away and you just knew there were gonna be twists and turns throughout the show. another thing I like was almost every character that I didn't really like at first, came around for me. For example Jesse, mike, and Saul. Skyler was prob my least favorite but she was still great at her role. However my favorite thing about the show is that 1) every episode, every season gets better. And 2) Walt just continued to blow me away (especially in the final season) by how smart he was and how he always seemed to have an answer or a plan for everything. It was like he knew it was gonna happen (of course it's a show but his character was portrayed as a very knowledgeable man). All in all, this show will go down in the books, at least for me it will. It truly had everything, even gave me a few laughs here and there. Also teaches a lesson to some extent. Tell your friends to tell there friends that they need to watch this show!"
10.0,2 October 2022,"I absolutely looooved this series!!!! GOT is my number one but this is a very tight second...funny as heck many times, sad which could bring tears to your eyes, shocking scenes that get your blood pumping, and top of the line acting.. i mean, everyone was sooo awesome!

Once again i was not thrilled about the ending.. in fact, i never wanted it to end...hahahhaa... but all good things come to an end. Where have all the great original writers gone now? Everything else is just the same old thing.. recreating whats already been done.

Come on original writers, come back! We are desperate for something good while we come home from a hard days work and just want to forget the worlds craziness and enjoy real content!! We miss you. Why isnt my review showing??"
10.0,19 August 2021,"PERFECT SHOW. Nothing more. Nothing less.

I kept wondering why Breaking Bad is considered as the best show ever made. I kept asking myself what makes this receive that high of a reception. It's not like it has any visual elements to keep your attention or anything.

This show deserves the Universal acclaim for it's unique linear-take of story-telling. Let me tell you, after i've watched this, i felt an intense feeling. A feeling of incomprehension or something or i don't know. At first, i was like, yeah sure it's good and all. But not groundbreaking or anything. I watched BB almost exactly an year ago, in August 2020. But now, when i re-watched it, it hit immensely different, like my-rating-went-from 8.9-to-9.4-way different.

WALTER WHITE is a character of the CENTURY. The way Bryan portrays Walter weighs equal to some legendary statue of someone, im tellin' you.

The shows makes a simplified linear plot point into a complex variety. Breaking Bad is a phenomenal drama in TV. Vince Gilligan made something fabulous! That's it. He made SOME-THING. A revolution in TV.

Thanks for this!! Never forget!"
10.0,17 October 2013,"The best TV show I have seen. I'm one of the people that didn't even know about it until it had nearly ended, and I managed to watch all 5 seasons in just over a month. I had to wait a while for the last few episodes, as they hadn't been broadcast, and the wait was unbearable.

What at first seems like an odd plot, and certainly not one you could stretch over 5 seasons, instantly becomes an utterly fantastic TV show. It is brilliantly acted, particularly by the two main actors, Cranston and Paul. The story lines are so engrossing you won't be able to stop watching - your nights will just be a blur of constant episodes.

It's also one of those brilliant shows that doesn't fluctuate or get worse with the introduction of new seasons. In my opinion, the last season was the best, and the fourth the second. Fantastic characters, fantastic villains, fantastic plots. So many moments are almost too tense to watch.

I would recommend this show to anybody, I've told several of my friends to watch it and not a single one has not said they loved it.

All in all, absolutely brilliant."
10.0,31 May 2019,"Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time but please, just don't let your toxic brain ruined this platform. How pathetic all of you to praised this show and rated Game of Thrones 1 just because you didn't have the finale you want before."
10.0,26 May 2019,"Well, I have seen about 50 series in my life. proly 10-15 out of them are just garbage, about 20 are good, and the others are very good(like true detective,sherlock). Only ONE is on another level, like others are on earth and it is in the sky with clouds. Of course its BrBa. Only series that is closer is The Sopranos(in fact, only thing I don't like is that it's too stretched). This one is like father or grandfather of BrBa. But there is only one KING."
10.0,29 May 2019,"I don't think that there will be series in the level of breaking bad...It is mysterious, has incredible actors and epic story. it is recommended for everybody"
10.0,8 August 2012,"This is the best show on television. Nowadays the shows that are so- called ""main-stream"" overrun the channels, but there are a few that detach from that group. And in that group there is that 1 show, the show that leaves you aching for the next season premiere, the show that overshadows all the others. That show is Breaking Bad.

This is by-far the best television program I have ever watched. It has that older Tarantino-Scorsese style and flow to it. Like the Pulp Fiction Tarantino and the Goodfellas Scorsese. In order to prove how exhilarating this show is I have to compare to the ELITE writers and directors in cinema. I can't just say that Vince Gilligan made a show I have to say that he made THE show. THE show that movie-lovers adore and can't wait for to air.

GIVE THE SHOW A CHANCE. I know many people that say this, ""I don't condemn a teacher selling meth"". Walter White isn't involved with drugs to sniff and puff. He is involved in order to support his family after he dies because he is diagnosed with lung cancer. So go on NETFLIX and watch the first 4 seasons of the show. It will be worth your while."

7.0,22 February 2020,"Wow! what a hell of a journey it was! BReaking BAd is seriously something worth watching! Keep patience on season 1, and 'when you're in, you're in'.

Fantastic characters, Screenplay, Plot, Direction..It was a masterpiece of these kind.

Best series I've ever watched!

(& Don't miss 'Better call Saul', prequel of Breaking Bad. Maybe It'd be interesting If you watch in this order: 'Better call Saul', then 'Breaking Bad' & atlast 'EL Camino'.)"
5.0,16 January 2010,"Now let's get one thing straight; this is a television program NOT for the faint at heart. If you like your viewing saccharine, with easy answers and everything wrapped up and snapped back to the beginning by the end of the episode, Breaking Bad is not for you. The premise alone should be enough to tell you that; a cancer-stricken father who is a chemistry teacher turns to illegal drug manufacture with a not-too-bright ex-student and struggles with his own mortality and morality along the way, doing his best to hide the new career choice from his pregnant wife, son with cerebal palsy, medic sister-in-law and law enforcer brother. Yes, this isn't light-weight material by any means.

I'm not a fan of these shows that rely on ""inflated sense of tension"" to pump up the viewer's adrenaline levels while covering for poor scripting; stuff like 24, Lost and Prison Break started out well-enough but quickly descended into this cheap shock tactic approach to keep the audience hooked. Once I saw through this I stopped watching them completely and have been seeking out quality American shows that are well-produced and equally well-written, and I am happy to say that Breaking Bad is one of these.

Bryan Cranston is perfectly cast as Walt, the man who has to make tough choices to provide for his family. He so perfectly becomes the character that it was not until later I realised he was previously cast as Hal in Malcolm In The Middle. His emotional range is staggering; with a few well-timed gestures or vocalisations he can convey several feelings at once, and when Walt is in pain it is completely believable. Walt is a man of few words, but chooses these words very carefully, so when he speaks everyone on-screen and in the audience are listening.

Cranston isn't just carrying passengers though; he's ably supported by Anna Gunn as his wife Skylar, who brings just the right amount of care and concern for her husband and baby as needed and RJ Mitte plays the son who has CP and gives a very accurate, non-condescending portrayal of the condition so different from the ham-handed ""sympathy ploy"" approach so overused by shows from the States. Dean Norris plays Walt's brother Hank, the all-American police officer who doesn't take any guff and flushes out drug dealers for a living, with his quirky kleptomaniac wife Marie (the lightest character in this show, amusingly) who is handled with panache by Betsy Brandt. Rounding out the main cast is Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, every inch the nervy, paranoid and streetwise ""cook"" who becomes Walt's new partner and guide to the world of drug trafficking.

There's much to recommend. Tight, well-plotted scripts that make the unbelievable tangible and don't waste a line while doing so. Superb, inventive direction and settings that perfectly fit the mood of the show, an interesting mixture of steadicam, handicam, point-of-view and camcorder shots that appear to be captured by the cast themselves. Excellent choice of soundtrack; almost every episode ends with a classic song and the musical cues throughout really add to the atmosphere without becoming overpowering; witness the searing, high-pitched noises when we see through Walt's eyes as he is in pain or being given bad news for an example.

What is most remarkable is that the show never gives easy answers, never biases us towards the characters (we are given both sides of the debate and left to make our own choices, which respects the viewers intelligence) and always does things that you will not expect. There is not a single cliché to be found here, no way of knowing exactly how each person will react to the situations they are thrust into. These are complex, multi-faceted individuals with free will and their own motivations, who exist not as mere tools to advance the plot. The plot itself is always coherent and leaves very few loose ends. If you see an event or object framed, however subtlety, you can bet it will come back later on. Maybe not in the same episode, but as part of the story arc. And last but not least is the incredibly pitch black humour that crops up every now and then, so dark it almost feels uncomfortable to laugh.

If you liked the first season of Dexter but don't like the direction it has now, Breaking Bad is for you. Not since I saw Firefly (a very different kind of show) have I enjoyed a television program this much. If they can carry this program on for two or three more seasons and then end it without dragging past the logical closure point - and with Walt the way he is, this is crucial - it will be one of the greatest drama series of all time.

If you haven't tried it, start from the pilot episode, keep an open mind, and you just might find your new favourite show. I know I did."
10.0,28 June 2019,"To date, this is the only show that not only never falters in quality, but is consistently fantastic for all five seasons. It deserves all the praise it gets and more. It holds the title of my favorite show with an iron grip and won't let go any time soon."
10.0,1 September 2019,"So I just finished this show today (8/31/19). This was one of the greatest, if not the greatest show I've ever seen. A true thrill ride from start to finish, and there was never a dull moment. A masterpiece all the way through if there ever was one. A great experience to remember. Thank you. 10/10"
10.0,2 April 2020,"Breaking Bad. Is the story of Walt White, a high school chemistry teacher working in a second job (car wash) to try to support his family. He takes a banal life, lives with his pregnant wife and his teenage son, who has cerebral palsy and have locomotive difficulties. Desperately hard up for money and constantly put down by those around him, Walt reaches the breaking point when he's diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He connects with former student Jesse Pinkman to start making and selling methamphetamines in order to raise money for his struggling family.

In my opinion, Breaking Bad is the best series that exists in the film industry. The series has a writing and production by Vince Gilligan, who created a story that portrays several problems that we live in society and makes us wonder how far the madness of a desperate man goes. The show also has an amazing actors, since Bryan Cranston, who plays the main character Walter White, representing very well all his moments of despair and insanity that the character has, that holds us every minute of the show and Aaron Paul who plays Jesse Pinkman as a supporting actor, a character who had a difficult and unlucky life manipulated by everyone around him, but with a pure and naive heart living a roller coaster of emotions through out the show very well performed by the actor. The character development is simply incredible, which makes us have a special connection with each of them and the story of the whole series is very well accomplished and does not take us out of the series at any time. I have repeated the show several times, all the episodes are good and I have never regretted watching it. Thanks to Vince Gilligan, AMC and everyone who participated in the realization of the series for the excellent work they have achieved. 10 STARS"
10.0,7 February 2021,"I just finished the show this past week and wow.. It is one of my favorite shows (if not then my favorite). Simply one of the best. The acting, plot, twists, and the soundtrack are all absolutely phenomenal. I loved seeing the transition of Walt's character: from a timid, nerdy teacher to a badass drug lord. I'm still in awe of how amazing this show is. My only complaint is that I wish I had watched it sooner! This is a show I will definitely watch again and again!"
10.0,20 March 2019,Breaking Bad is a complete masterpiece. The only time I was upset was when it was over. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you haven't seen it you need to watch it now!
10.0,22 September 2024,"Television has been on a downhill slope for a long time but this series it one of the few rare exceptions. Not that the stories are in any way realistic but they are well told thus making them more believable.

The show easily held my interest and can even be rewatched. The main characters, Walter and Jessie, make a good team as they go through a love/hate type of relationship while rising to the top of their trade. Even the supporting cast is for the most part an asset though a couple of the characters like Skyler and especially her sistem are not really well written.

This show is highly recommended."

10.0,22 January 2020,"So...I was a little late to this party, but not the type of late where you get there after it's over and the cops are arresting someone for indecent exspoiler! No, I went in fresh while season 3 was currently airing. Which meant I was able to avoid any major spoilers and caught up to a live season 4. And like EVERYONE else that has ever watched BB, I could not wait for the next episode. That is until the very last one, you know, that last episode where immediately following it you go into a state of panic that includeds depression, feelings of complete emptiness, a total loss of self worth and questions of how in the hell can you even go on??? Then, when you finally come to grips with the end of the world as you know it... a light goes off, and you do the one and only thing that makes any sense, the only thing that can even begin to help make you whole again, that one thing that can wake you from your television induced coma... and completley rewatch the entire series 5 more times! So if your wondering if this is a good show worthy of your time, if this is a show that can change your life, if this is a show that will prepare you for the afterlife and put you at ease knowing there is God spmewhere out there and he/she has a plan, then I'm here to say yes, you should watch this show!"
10.0,20 May 2019,Worlds best series ever.... It deserve 10/10 rating
10.0,3 October 2022,
6.0,26 June 2020,This is an original piece of work with strong performances at its core. It also has some memorable scenes. Ultimately however it feels like an ultra dark comedy that puts style and ingenuity above realism and substance. Whilst ultimately it's a question of taste give me the soul and realism of The Wire every day over the trendy style and at times unremittingly bleak view of humanity on display here.
1.0,14 December 2019,"I tried to like this series. When it debuted, I watched two episodes and quickly just stopped recording it. Later, after c oming to really enjoy ""Better Call Saul"", I bought BB on dvd. It didn't get any better than my first impression. I absolutely hated the two central characters. Cranston, with his mouth sagging open all the time, revealing his bottom row of front teeth, made his character look like an imbecile.

Aaron Paul, looking like a skanky little rodent from a privileged background and acting like a barely sentient child was every bit as annoying as Cranston. I've seen both of them in other work since then and they are the same; annoyingly bad actors.

Maybe if the central characters weren't so insufferable, I would have been able to like this series. The main idea was OK, but the way the story was developed made the whole thing ridiculous. I despise Brian Cranston, to start with, and can't stand to look at him, so maybe that soured me on the series to start with, but his whole family and circle of friends are insufferable as well.

The wife, the son, the sister in law and the DEA brother-in-law are totally unlikable characters. Pauls' circle of friends are imbecilic and the constant nonsense about Paul using dope and making messes is ridiculous and unbelievable. People who do the things he did in a neighborhood like the one where he lives would be in prison in short order. This is supposed to be Albuquerque, not NYC.

The dvd sets had no subtitles and the sound levels were very inconsistent, so maybe I'm missing a lot of what was said, which could be why the whole thing quickly became uninteresting, but that wouldn't have made good characters insufferable. That had to be the fault of the writers and casting directors.

4 stars is being generous. I bought the entire series on dvd because so many people raved over it. I soon learned that all of those people would probably rave over a series about dogs crapping on carpet."
10.0,3 September 2022,"What i found amazing in this show were the detailings it was pulled with, which i have never seen for any other show.

It is perfect show with very amazing and neat ending.

And the show's other elements such title , intro and music were also justified neatly within the show.

And the most important thing in the series is the story line which makes you crazy to binge watch the show, i myself completed watching the series within a week, this is very addictive show with huge amount of suspense ,black comedy ,humour and most importantly chemistry which is the building block for a show.

Amazing show happened for the viewers ,critics and for other actors ,directors, writer to be inspired off."

Trust me, if you haven't already seen it, do it as soon as possible. Just watch the first couple episodes and you will be addicted."

Its essential to the story, once you do get hooked onto it, you end up wanting more and MORE like drugs. This is so well written and perfectly executed that its almost crazy.

This series has inspired so many spin off's / movies, i mean its a decade old and still one of the best on my list."

I couldn't stand the fighting, and how stupid Walt was acting. None of it really made sense, realistically. Maybe it dosent work for me, cause when I watch tv, I can take it personally. When Hank found out that Walt was smoking pot, he could have totally under every situation taken him down to the station. But he didn't! Which is a federal offence since he works for the DEA!!! Like guys! These are simple mistakes! Was SO bored through majority of it. I mean, I'm not a drug addict so maybe that's also why I'm not a fan of this show??"

I really don't get why this TV show is so high rated, if you want to watch something intriguing climatic with twists watch these shows, I recommend Game of thrones, Wentworth, the 100, Power, The blacklist, Blindspot, Homeland, Stranger things, Empire, How to get away with murder, Making a murderer, Narcos, El Chapo, I don't know if its because I watched these before Breaking Bad but was really terrible compared to these especially as so many people thought breaking bad was amazing."

His brother in law is a DEA agent.

At the age of 50 he got cancer.

Then he decides to earn money.

He started cooking meth with his ex student,name Jesse pinkman.

Here the story starts.

Walter white makes a full empire of his business. Some kinds of ups and downs comes in that story.

There is some important characters like gus fring, Saul,Mike.

They play vital rule into this story. Into the middle of the story his wife cheats on him.

By knowing this he became a monster.

Lastly the story ends with a very sad story.

In my Opinion, I prefer people to watch the series."

Believe me just watch this series can change your life.

Great songs, character changes, science, philosophy, psychology and action, this is a series with all these and more.

. .

Do you want to know how good this series is? If you just look at it cinematically, the scenes shot are in a rhythm, or it might be more accurate to call it harmony. We are talking about a series that includes the mysteries of some characters and all these. I don't know if this series is the best, but it is definitely one of the best. There will never be a series like this series, it is one of a kind, it is a very special director, the actors, the places where the set takes place, we are talking about a masterpiece whose small details are always wonderful.

If you have any doubts, never mind, listen to me and watch this masterpiece you won't regret it."

It does.

Breaking Bad achieves something I've not seen a single TV show do, it doesn't have a single bad episode. It doesn't a single boring or mediocre plot line. It is the most consistent show I've ever seen and it is amazing. It is entertainment in the truest sense with its magical ability to transport you and make you stare at your screen in wonder or horror or whatever it decides it wants to do that episode. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are such complex and engaging characters that you're almost constantly switching between rooting for them and being horrified by them. It's a show that's pure escapism and is just as addictive as Walter's meth. I ended up watching the entire last season in one day. I don't particularly like calling something perfect as I don't think anything is. But I'd be hard pressed to say that this could be any better. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. It's a tragedy of Greek proportions while having the grandiose action of movies like Die Hard. It's incredibly stylish while also being extremely subtle at times. As a consumer of entertainment of any form you owe it to yourself to watch the epic ballad of Walter White AKA Heisenberg."

He is one talented actor for sure, the entire series transformation from a middle age guy that gets a deathly health diagnosis to change most of who is to make sure his family will be taken care of once he is gone and the boundaries he crosses to do it.

And the supporting cast did an amazing job on this as well

MUST SEE!!!!"

5.0,21 September 2019,The best series I've ever watched. The characters develop over the episodes and seasons and the plot gets deeper and more exciting. The character of Walter uncovers over the time both to himself and the audience. I cannot really find a weakness in the this show.
10.0,2 August 2019,Masterpiece. Great. Amazing. 10/10 would recommend.
10.0,3 November 2019,The best series ever made! The script and the writing is outstanding! Bryan's and aaron's acting is out of this world. Vince Gilligan Thank you!
10.0,30 September 2013,"Breaking Bad is one of the most acclaimed television series in recent history. Created by Vince Gilligan, this TV show won ten Primetime Emmy Awards, was ranked the 13th best-written TV series of all time by the Writers Guild of America, and in 2013 it was enlisted in the Guiness Book of World Records as the highest-rated TV series of all time.

I won't go into detail about the plot, since I think you are all familiar with the story of a talented, underachieving chemist who learns that he has inoperable lung cancer and decides to cook crystal meth to make money. Instead, I'll go straight to the point and try to say what makes Breaking Bad so good and acclaimed. But, what is left to be said about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said a thousand times before? The series was amazingly well directed and edited, it was shot on beautiful locations and it featured a prime soundtrack. But the things that made me, personally, enjoy Breaking Bad as much as I did were the writing and the acting.

Surely, the best aspect of Breaking Bad is how fine it is written – the way it depicts a man 'breaking bad' so well, the audience can empathise with that man. I'd say the majority of people live every day like Walter White did, just waiting for a dramatic change in their lives, just waiting for their 'inner Heisenberg' to pop out. I'd say, every person is partly Walter White, partly Heisenberg, and that's why the audience could root for Heisenberg. Even when he did menacing and horrible things, the audience still rooted for him to succeed, because they partly rooted for 'their own Heisenberg' to succeed one day – if he did pop out one day. Vince Gillagan knows that neither the characters in the series, nor the audience watching the series are either white or schwarz – we are all grey (matter). By acknowledging and developing this moral relativity, Breaking Bad easily became one of the most praised TV-shows of all time.

But, of course, what's the point of a well written story and characters if there are no decent actors to back this up? Luckily, Breaking Bad has one of the bast cast ensembles I've seen in a television series in a long time. Bryan Cranston is magnificent when playing two different characters – Walter White and Heisenberg – and their variations. Aaron Paul is perfect as the troubled Jesse Pinkman, Anna Gunn is great as Skyler White, the character whom the audience loved to hate, but also the character without whom the show would be impossible to imagine. And then there are Dean Norris, Rj Mitte, Betsy Brandt, Bob Odenkirk and many more – all of whom did a terrific job. Breaking Bad truly is a show full of memorable characters that are backed up by immensely talented actors.

I wouldn't dare to go as far as to call Breaking Bad the best TV-show ever created, but one thing is certain: I enjoyed the hell of it and I'm looking forward to future projects from the people that made this masterpiece as good as it is. I thank all of you for the good time I had while watching this show! It was one fun ride that, unfortunately, had to end eventually, but I hope I'll see all of you soon in another project!

10.0,23 October 2021,"I had to watch season to see if maybe it got better and why it's rated higher than anything ever before. Well I've gone from a 7 season 1, 6 for 2nd and now a 5 for season 3. I simply have had enough of Walts wife. She is the consummate bitch everybody, men and women can't stand. I see enough of this type character in real life and I'm going try to make self continue on I can honestly say this wife grates my nerves worse than any character I've ever seen in my life. I'm not a novice I've rated over 3,500 shows and movies on here. But there's still at least another 2,000 I've seen and not rated from my early years so when I tell you I've never been as disturbed by a contrary, narrow minded, whiny conservative white woman im saying that with a ton of experie on which to base it. Hell she's worst than 'Mommie Dearest' and whew she was bad. She plays the part too well, must be her real personality. No way in the world this show deserves at the very very best more than a 5. Look at my average ratings.. over 80% 7's or higher which prices I'm not just a hater. I seriously can't believe how easily people are swayed by the prevailing public interest. Just the opposite has happened with good shows being ranked to low and this is most certainly the same case but only the opposite. I'm told the last two seasons are the best so I may improve my ranking but as of end of season 3, it's a 5! Solid 5!"
10.0,5 June 2019,"The best show ever, amazing, captivating and extremely thrilling with unbelievable twist and turns while also realistic. Epic!"

10.0,29 March 2020,"Aside its achievements in acting,writing and editing, the real factor that makes Breaking Bad the cult, unforgettable sensation is the character development that every character forgoes throughout this legendary show one step at a time. Eventhough there are some events that are considered to be monotone in the series,The show never stops rewarding the viewer in its modern Surf tone."

10.0,17 October 2024,"I've watched thousands of series, but this one stands out as the greatest of all. There are no words to describe the sheer perfection of this series-""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The script, the characters, and the story are simply unparalleled, pulling you into a world that feels raw, real, and emotionally charged.

The script is tightly written, leaving no room for filler or unnecessary plotlines. Every scene, every piece of dialogue, and every moment is crafted with purpose and precision. The way the story unfolds, taking us from the mundane life of a high school chemistry teacher to the complex, dangerous world of drug manufacturing, is nothing short of extraordinary. The writers manage to maintain tension, suspense, and drama from the first episode to the last, ensuring that viewers are hooked throughout the entire series. It's a show that doesn't waste your time;"
9.0,10 August 2024,
10.0,23 August 2019,"Though it's lengthy all the way from Season 1 to Season 5, it's worth every second to watch. The characters and story line would hold each other so tightly throughout the season. You would not feel any missing piece or loose ends after finishing up all seasons.

I am glad to have watched it finally, but also sad that it would feel like garbage to watch most of other shows since I have already seen one of the best shows. :)"
10.0,4 September 2022,"After watching the entire series, I came to the conclusion that the series is actually not that good. It's overrated!

The first season deserved to get 10 out of 10, while the rest of the season is just okay, and the last season is the most ludicrous season ever and has an identity crisis.

Breaking Bad began with a strong scenario, a lot of smart humor, great acting, and interesting stories, but as the season progressed, there were a lot of flaws here and there, especially in terms of the character's development and appearance.

The writers need to learn more about human psychology to make the plot make sense rather than just make it as intense and brutal as possible. They should learn how the situation would play out in the family in real life, and make the characters develop naturally.

The story's timeframe in Breaking Bad was also established at around a year, despite the fact that it took nearly five years to shoot the entire season. Thus, we can clearly see the drastic aging of the characters. Especially on Walt's son, Flynn ( Walter Jr.) and Jesse Pinkman, which is ridiculous.

I know that many people want to make a series have a jaw-dropping ending, but it doesn't mean you can screw the story and characters up in order to end the series just like the writers of Breaking Bad did at the end of the season. Many scenes and plot in season 5 were not solid and logical. The plot of Breaking Bad used to build the ending has many irrational scenes, stories, and dialogue. At the end, the writers of Breaking Bad just wanted to make the main character into a badass hero, and the other characters blamed him for everything bad that happened and portrayed him as a supervillain, just like they had never known him in person, and it was only him who committed sins."

10.0,20 September 2024,"One of the best old series I've watched, I rarely give reviews and it deserves a 10/10 same as of Shogun 2024.

From character building, to cinematics. All in all it's one of the best for me.

WW's character is relatable especially if you're a father. At first I was expecting pinkman to be the heir of WW's career on this particular genre. It turned out to be a better ending.

A great balance of reality and fantasy. I wish I could expound more but I don't wanna spoil anything. Best way is to watch it an put your self in the protagonist shoes. It's not always sunshines and rainbows for everyone. But one thing's for sure. You're gonna love it and you're gonna learn from it!"
10.0,9 July 2022,I must say I have binged and watched many shows in my time and this show is by far the greatest show I have ever seen. The hero becomes the villain. The feeling sorry and the hatred for a character. I love everything about this show I wish Hollywood would make more of these great shows and stay away from the woke political BS.
10.0,3 September 2019,"I promise you, every review you have read for this show and everything you've heard about it from friends or family is either an understatement or only partially captures the utter perfection that is Breaking Bad. There is simply no overstating the quality of this series in virtually every aspect.

This show has ruined television for me. Because of this show, I can no longer stand to watch the absolute garbage that passes for a television series these days, and after you watch Breaking Bad, neither will you. You will see what a TV show can actually achieve-- memorable, multi-faceted characters that feel like people you know in real life and thus are impossible not to sympathize with, a nuanced and utterly gripping story that doesn't treat you, the viewer, like a brain-dead idiot, acting performances that leave absolutely nothing to be desired, flawless pacing episode to episode (those who say the first few seasons are slow are only saying so in retrospect after having completed the series)...I could go on. For God's sake, the subplots in this show are better written and developed than literally 99% of TV shows these days.

How can I prove to you that it is this good? I have not watched an episode in at least 4 years. And here I sit at 1am, thinking about how good this show was and feeling compelled to create an IMDb account and write a review. I can safely say that no other show I've ever seen has caused me to do this.

Do yourself a favor and watch. this. show."

10.0,11 February 2016,"Best show in TV ever? Master Piece? Yeah, right! Its good, but its NOT THAT GOOD! Read so much about this show, got the whole 5 season to to find the critics were so off! First of all, the script was boring, dull and predictable. Terminally ill chemistry teacher X mid life crisis? A recipe for yawn! As for acting, to be fair, Bryan Cranston is good, better than Liev Schreiber in Ray Donovan, but definitely could not beat James Spader in Black List and Kevin Spacey as FU for the Golden Globe 2013! When I binge on the Black List and Utopia I wished everyday had 48 hours and wish it would never end. With Breaking Bad, after the first season I basically dozed through the second season and then just turning it on while working just for the heck of it. Honestly would have rated this lower than one if possible. Better rated than Walking Dead and Vikings? Yeah okay, I'll kick your son in the ribs."
10.0,2 October 2019,"In the beginning I liked the series.It was interesting to watch as them cook drugs. The first season was in line with my expectations. The series stirs some tension, but it was never like - the ""main"" scene. The action in the series is interesting at first. But later is seems forced and not as watchable. I expected more from this series."

It's far from one of the best shows ever, You might disagree if you are American."

I was bored in some of the seasons, but I was adamant to see it through to see what the big deal was. Ok, I'll admit there were like 2? badass scenes but apart from that, nothing memorable for me."
10.0,23 May 2020,Very enjoyable and entertaining. Simple and easy to follow story. Good acting and great story. Not quite up there with the greats such as the Wire but well worth watching.
10.0,20 October 2018,"Decided to watch Breaking Bad after hearing nothing but good things about it for years. The first season was great, really interesting and intriguing. Then it just went kind of downhill from there. A few times it would pick up, but over all boring. I actually don't understand how this show has such great reviews and why it's said to be one of the best TV shows made. The characters consistently did things out of character, or I couldn't understand what their motivations were coming from. I would recommend first season, and after that just stop. It's not worth watching the other four. I wish I would have stopped and watched something else."
10.0,22 August 2019,"""Say my name"" Gives me chills every time. I have watched this series and certain episodes so many times, I can not count anymore. Love it!"
6.0,29 August 2019,"In the past two years, I have binged many TV shows. (Mad Men, The Sopranos, Deadwood, Twin Peaks, The Wire, Six Feet Under, The Twilight Zone etc. etc.) I'm always watching something, new or old. And the show that started it all was Breaking Bad. This is the show I always come back too every year. Right now I am currently re watching it for the 3rd time and I've finally come to the conclusion that this is the greatest show of all time. Why is it so amazing?

The characters. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are two of the greatest TV characters ever conceived. they're both really strong and well developed characters. Walter at the start of the series has a heart like Mr Rogers and then he slowly evolves into Scarface as the series progresses. Walt always ropes Jesse into doing his dirty work, making his life horrible as the days go by.

This series to me has NO BAD EPISODES and NO BAD SEASONS. I could recount the plot for every episode of this show if I wanted to. 3rd time watching already and this show has never bored or failed to disappoint me once. The show gets better every season. The characters get stronger every season.

The Acting in this show is phenomenal. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is one of the greatest performances ever. Anna Gunn's convincing performance as Skylar White, what else is there too say, she's one of TV's greatest b*tch characters. Aaron Paul's presence in the series. It's just one great blend.

This series is as addictive as the blue meth in the show. It always keeps you engaged and will always push the limit. Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show ever made. If you haven't seen it, it's never too late."
1.0,17 January 2020,I saw a lot TV Shows. This is definitly one of the top three. Walter White is brilliant!
10.0,15 December 2021,"For the learners of film making, its a perfect teaching tool. Cast, locations, photography, music, direction, production - every department excels. A must watch if you are a student of motion pictures."
10.0,20 June 2019,"Watched it like 5 years after it aired. Excellent, except season 3,little bit slow and boring."
10.0,18 January 2020,"The main theme of the story is clear. Excellent development of environment and characters that surround the hero, with emotional approach and identification. There is a link of all the elements to a changing fact that helps the story to evolve."
10.0,7 February 2024,
10.0,8 April 2020,"Honestly, when I heard of this show I didn't think I'd like it. I thought it would be a show that glorified drug use, but it was quite the opposite. It showed the dark side of addiction to drugs, money, power. Such a great show."
10.0,19 December 2020,"Although the main character decides to supplement his income as a high school teacher by producing drugs, this is by all means not an easy journey. The gains are few and far between and the downside of the business, that is the violence and human destruction that come with it, far from glamorise the subject.

The series can be extremely disturbing and, at the same time, extremely funny. The humour is usually dark and will therefore not be to everyone's taste but it is very well achieved in the series. This is more obvious in season 1 rather than on season 2, which grew darker and left me feeling uneasy at the end of each episode. This is a very violent show, both in terms of physical violence, with the usual shootings and general gore that are so prominent on a number of recent television series, but also in terms of human suffering and interaction, as is visible in the depiction of drug addicts.

The characters are generally solid and have enough depth to surprise the viewer. They are not all lovable; some are in fact rather annoying but this does not mean that they are superfluous. The story is good and keeps moving forward at good pace."
10.0,17 November 2018,This show was okay but I loved the lines that they had and my favorite character was Jesse.

10.0,3 April 2020,"One word, Perfection. Kudos to the creators for this mind-shattering peice. I have watched so many movies and originals but this invoked me to pen down review I believe this is a toxic and very thriller masterpeice that shall keep you engaged for 48 to 49 minutes in each episode that you will be eager to hit the next episode. Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan, which I lately finished watching, revolves around a chemistry teacher Mr. Walter White, who actually is fighting a battle with a deadly diseases Lung Cancer, decides to cook meth (a kind of drug) in order to repay his medical debts. Things go fine until he partners up Jesse Pinkman a meth-head. This crime drama portrays the canny picture of selfishness, lust of power, revenge and self-redempation.

Give a try because I rate it 10/10 for writing, story, directing and importantly acting."
10.0,5 December 2023,"The series is quite gripping. After 2 seasons, the divisions flow like water. Sky's betrayal, Walter's effort for his family, Jesse and Walt's work together in the father-son relationship. It is a series that I definitely recommend you to watch. Although it may seem a boring series in general, when you look at it in general, you will realize that it is a very high-quality series. The detailing of everything in the series has added a special beauty. The illegal events committed by the Gus and Salamanca family and Walt's brother-in-law being a police officer is one of the topics that will be discussed in the series."
10.0,24 August 2022,"""Breaking Bad"" was always a show about consequences. More than arguably any other drama, decisions had repercussions and slates weren't wiped clean between episodes."
10.0,4 September 2019,"Today, it's exactly eight months since I finished watching Breaking Bad. At first, I actually thought of watching just the 1st season and continuing it in the summer but I ended up binging it in just 4 weeks when exams were going on. Such was it's fever. Firstly, BREAKING.BAD.IS.THE.BEST.SHOW.EVER. Nothing has ever been like it, and nothing will ever be. My love for BB cannot be described in words and I'm not exaggerating when I say that Breaking Bad is a part of me. Every character there is a part of my life. I'm a guy who easily gets influenced by fictional characters and Walter White aka Heisenberg, Jesse Pinkman, Saul and every character there has something you could take in your life. Breaking Bad's is one of the most iconic stories ever and there is not a better way to put it in screen than the way they did it. The script, character arc development, music, cinematography, screenplay, dialogues, art direction, and mainly the acting. Everything about this show is pure class. Some episodes are legit like adventure rides and I don't even know how people who were watching it when it aired waited a week and a year for every episode and season. I started watching it after I read someone comment, ""Not watching BB is a sin."" and now I'm telling you, even 'that' is an understatement. I don't think it's valued enough in our circle but I recommend everybody to watch it if you haven't yet. Don't quit because it's slow, you'll miss out. . Only if I could erase my memory, I would erase BB and re-watch it again without a second thought. 'Cause Breaking Bad > Anything on screen. Period."

9.0,16 February 2024,"Breaking Bad is one of the most acclaimed and influential TV shows of all time. It tells the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher who turns to producing and selling methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Along the way, he faces various challenges and enemies, both in the criminal underworld and in his personal life.

The show is a brilliant exploration of morality, identity, and consequences. It features complex and realistic characters, who undergo dramatic transformations and face difficult dilemmas. The show also has a gripping plot, full of twists, suspense, and action. The writing is superb, with witty dialogue, clever symbolism, and memorable quotes. The cinematography, music, and acting are also outstanding, creating a unique and immersive atmosphere.

Breaking Bad is not only a thrilling and entertaining show, but also a profound and thought-provoking one. It raises questions about the nature of good and evil, the limits of human rationality, and the impact of choices on oneself and others. It also offers a commentary on the social and economic issues of contemporary America, such as the health care system, the drug war, and the corruption of power.

Breaking Bad is a show that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. It is a masterpiece of modern television, and a must-watch for anyone who appreciates quality storytelling. It is a show that will stay with you long after you finish watching it."

10.0,5 February 2024,"I wasn't really fond of the premise of the show. I had friends continuously recommend me to watch this perfect show. I do have to say that I was missing out.

This show has to be a clear top 10 show in your book. I think each and every character work perfectly and intertwine amazingly with each other. Every character works in their own way. I can understand the hate for Skylar White but at the same time, her role in the overall story is perfect.

Walter's character arc from this somewhat innocent man to a kingpin of sorts all due to the fact that his pride got the better of him.

I loved Jesse Pinkman in the show, his and Walter's chemistry (pun intended) is a delight to watch.

You don't need me to rant on how good this show is, just watch it."
10.0,13 July 2023,"Title: Breaking Bad: A Groundbreaking Television Series

Breaking Bad, created by Vince Gilligan, is a groundbreaking television series that has left an indelible mark on the medium. The show's gripping storytelling, exceptional acting, and innovative cinematography set it apart as a true masterpiece in the television industry.

One of the most notable aspects of Breaking Bad is its compelling narrative. The series follows the journey of Walter White, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer. The show delves into the moral complexities of Walter's transformation from a meek and overlooked individual to a ruthless and powerful figure in the criminal underworld. The intricate plot twists and character development keep viewers on the edge of their seats, making it a truly addictive viewing experience.

The performances in Breaking Bad are nothing short of extraordinary. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is simply mesmerizing. Cranston effortlessly navigates the complexities of his character, bringing forth both Walter's vulnerabilities and his menacing persona. Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner-in-crime, delivers an equally captivating performance, capturing Jesse's emotional turmoil and journey of self-discovery.

The series' cinematography is also worthy of praise. The visual style of Breaking Bad is innovative and visually stunning. The use of unique camera angles and compositions enhances the storytelling, creating a sense of tension and unease.

10.0,9 May 2024,"As a former addict, I've never seen a show depict the lifestyle, the characters, and the spirals of addiction and greed as honestly as this show does. People think that the drug game is all rap soundtracks, guns, running from the cops, and extremes. Nope! Not my experience nor is it the experience of a lot of people I know.

It's a lot of low level knuckleheads who don't know what they're doing. It's a very, very slow trip to a very dark place, with many close calls in between. Magnificent. It's amazing that they were able to tell such an incredible story over such a long period of time without ""jumping the shark"" as they say. Or finding the need to squeeze the last bit of viewership out of the audience (well, they did make Better Call Saul, but I can forgive them for that)."
6.0,9 June 2019,
1.0,30 April 2020,Amazingly perfect.. Loved it.. Acting and script nailed..
10.0,12 July 2022,"I know nothing is perfect, especially various media releases. But if there is a single one that is deemed worthy to be described as ""perfect"", it is without a doubt this show, Breaking Bad.

I have now watched this show 5 times from start to finish. It's the first box set I have ever purchased, even digitally. It is an extremely consistent piece of media from start to finish.

For very few, this show might not be right up your alley, which I can understand. But if there's anything that this show has earned, is it's earned the right for it to be blasphemy to directly say anything negative about the show. If there's any show or movie you wanna see before you die, Breaking Bad better be on that list."
10.0,19 July 2022,"I'm not writing review regularly!but breaking bad just made me do it! Such masterpiece,i wish i could erase it from my memory and watch it again and again for the rest of life! As i said a decent Masterwoek."
10.0,2 December 2019,It started of like a typical comedy and ended like the best series in history
10.0,23 June 2019,One of the best integrated drama I have seen in my life the best integrated scenario and the output and coherence of creative events
10.0,2 April 2020,The PERFECT series. That is all that needs to be said.
10.0,7 February 2022,"Ok show. Nothing special.

Good acting, average plot, average directing, average script.

Basically a good guide on how to make a 20 min episode last 45 mins.

Half the shots are people sitting, walking down a street, staring at each other, or just ""thinking"".

That the only way they know how to develop a character? Like just switch a scene from the dialogue to a person getting in their car, instead of 10 mins every episode of walking, staring into the sun, or just focusing on a face. Waste of screen time.

Same thing they do in Better Call Saul."
10.0,16 August 2019,I mean really the story is nice. But really It is so slow i do not want to wait 44 min for Mr.white to say we need to talk. Nether I want to know what does his wife feel. I really do not care. Give me story about drug and keep going with it. It is like they don't know how to make it long to they just filled it with family issues that nobody care about. Yes part of the family is important for the story but I think it is too much to the point where it is so boring.
10.0,8 July 2019,"Great show, lost it's way a little in the middle but the ending was so strong. A great TV series."
6.0,10 July 2022,"I'm sure other reviews have said it all, but I'd like to add. This show is absolutely phenomenal in terms of writing, acting, plot, character development, cinematography, music, just about everything. The story is truly gripping and improves with each season. Every actor nails their roles and fully commits to their performance. The chemistry between Walt and Jesse in particular is outstanding. There is hardly anything to complain about aside from very minor inconsistencies and nitpicks. Overall you just have to watch the show to get how amazing it is. Vince Gilligan is a genius for creating a tv show of such high quality."
1.0,3 July 2019,"After four months of binge watching, I finally finished watching Breaking Bad, and it is defently as good as people say it is, if not better. Nearly everything about the show, from the outstanding performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, who hands down give some of the best performances on television, to the writing, cinematography, editing, music is just incredible. You can tell with nearly every single episode that so much care and love was put into nearly every aspect of this show, and I can't praise it enough for that.

Just how the show develops Walter relationship with Jesse and his family in this is perfectly done. I especially love how this show presents how the consequences to Walter or Jesses' actions not only effect them, but other people as well. Without getting into spoilers, there are certain moments in the final three episodes that are essentially what the whole series has been leading up too, and they are probably the most heartbreaking things I have ever seen in general. In fact, I even cried TWICE during least three episodes, which is something that I never do since I normally don't get emotional about media in general.

Seriously, watch this if you havn't already. It is one of the few TV shows that I can say got better with each season, and I honestly havn't stopped thinking about it since I finished the final episode yesterday. It is an amazing experience from beginning to end."
10.0,10 October 2019,"I rate 10/10, I would say its an experience and must watch, I never saw anything like this before . GOT doesn't got much deserve ending but breaking bad truly well written master piece, eagerly waiting for El camino.. and am hearing master chef voice at the end of the trailer, very much looking forward"
10.0,10 December 2019,"I can't say enough about this. Just basically the nest series ever, you would never gonna watch anything better Hardly suggesting"
10.0,23 July 2022,
10.0,4 September 2019,"Every time I rewatch the entire Breaking Bad I find something new, it is like reading a fine book, I consider myself to be a super fan of Breaking Bad and incredible talent Vince Gilligan and the writers who helped make the show. The acting was superb and the locations were fantastic, like star trek next generation - this show is the icon, the universe Vince created is so special so kafkaesque so enigmatic that I just cannot stop watching.

I don't think I am nuts for enjoying a piece of art this way, do you stop listening to your favorite song? Do you only have sex once because it's always the same thing? I see it different every time and I love it.🚬"
10.0,31 May 2024,"I cried 18 and 1/2 times watching this show. I hope one day someone opens up a museum dedicated to this show because it is truly phenomenal. Every detail, every scene is so unique and beautifully crafted. Honestly I only watched this because my dad liked it, and I wanted to make him happy by watching. My life has changed since then. The characters, the story, the way the acting feels so real that you might as well be standing right w of them. If someone were to only watch one show for the rest of their lives, CHOOSE THIS! Breaking Bad is a masterpiece, and I LOVE YOU WALTER WHITE! 10/10 life changing piece of art!"
10.0,30 November 2023,"I just finished binging the entire series, now I'm here basically as a kind of therapy session. I had no idea it would be as dark, violent and twisted as it became. It's not a genre I'd normally watch, but I can see the brilliance in it. From the deception woven into the story to the stellar, and I mean STELLAR casting, it's a masterpiece. The cast really knocked it out of the park. That said it was really sad to see Walter White's decline into a depraved monster, when we know he was a caring family man at the beginning. That struck me as inauthentic. And depressing how it ended after destroying so many lives. The violence was really extremely disturbing though."
10.0,29 September 2013,"So many people recommended this to me but I kept reading bits about it and hesitating because it didn't sound very enthralling. Finally I gave in and watched Season 1 - and I was hugely disappointed. I only kept going with each episode because people kept saying it gets better & asking me to give it a chance and I'd love it. Well, sorry but I didn't. I had no connection to any of the characters in it and couldn't have cared less what happened to them. Many of the characters, particularly the women, were awful stereotypes with no depth. The script was boring, the plot was ridiculous and the cinematography & direction often irritating. One or two of the actors tried their best and were good but that isn't enough when the material is so woeful. Mostly tho the show just bored me to tears.

I have no clue why this is getting such rave reviews, awards etc. It feels like a case of the ""The Emporer's New Clothes"" to me where people are convinced it must be good because everyone else says so! And I've noticed anyone who writes a review on their blog/website that does anything short of praise this as the greatest TV series in history is inundated with the shows fans hurling childish badly worded abuse at them and suggesting they are ""(offensive word of some sort) morons"" etc. That disgustingly stupid behaviour in itself tells me more about the show than any review can."
9.0,17 July 2019,"Breaking Bad is more than a television show, some may describe it as a unique and formidable work of art; and that is being vague. One of the most, scratch that, the most incredible and intriguing pieces of work you could ever wish to see on a screen. So much so, that it is mind blowing to think that one person could ever write such a masterpiece. Therefore, Vince Gilligan deserves the utmost respect and admiration for being such a wizard of his art and mastering his craft. The acting on the show is truly awe inspiring and include many fantastic performances. From RJ Mitte playing Walter White's cerebral palsy stricken son 'Walter Jr', to Giancarlo Esposito playing a unbeknown notorious drug kingpin, who in the public eye was a generous, successful businessman, 'Gustavo Fring', the acting is so marvellous it begs to ask the question, ""Is it really acting?"" To conclude, I would thoroughly recommend this 'television series' but would prefer to recommend 'Gilligan's work of art' to anyone that has never witnessed the greatest show on this planet.

10.0,13 February 2021,"If I tell you a bit about it, you wouldn't forgive me, every second is worth watching, every episode a masterpiece, it is nostalgic finish it and addictive start it, how I tell you, it is a definition of masterpiece."
10.0,23 April 2019,"This show was good. It kept me entertained, and bored, for a lot of it. I usually have a hard time finishing a series but this one I made it to the end, so that says something. But on the other hand there are just SO many plot holes and things that just don't make sense. One of my biggest pet peeves was the baby, the family had a child, but most of the time the baby was nowhere to be found. Would a 1 year old child be anywhere but with its parents? It's like the producers just forgot for half a season that there should be a kid in a lot of these scenes. Near the end they started to have the kid around more but still, just couldn't get past how they could miss something like that. Another thing is the characters personalities. One episode they hate each other and try to kill each other until the show starts to get boring and there's not much else to do, then the characters all of a sudden love each other and want to work together again. Then something ridiculous happens and they want nothing to do with each other again. Or the cancer, once Walt went into remission, there was no mention Whatsoever of the cancer. It's like it never happened. And then the science part of it, which is huge, is just not at all realistic. Blue meth, not possible. That acid melting through a bathtub and floor, not possible. Not sure if all this was just laziness or lack of research, but this was definitely not one of the best shows out there.

I would give it a lower rating just because of how bad it all is after putting some logic to it, but it did keep me watching."
10.0,9 November 2013,"I decided to stop watching it in the middle of third season because I cannot stand it anymore and I can care less about what happens next.

A few weeks ago, I was looking for a good TV series through Netfix and saw ""Breaking Bad"" title. I heard about it previously and it had a great rating as well as on IMDb, so I gave a shot.

Wow, are you kidding me! This series is like an American version of those Korean or Taiwanese screaming, tearing, slow-paced TV drama shows. Don't get me wrong. Those kind of shows are extremely popular in Asia and my mother loves them except me. I agree that everyone has standards when it comes to show and film; however, this as the best in America where Hollywood resides... NO. Well, comparing to others, it could be the best and that's why I gave it one star rather than none.

""Slow-pacing"" is perceived differently. I don't consider ""Tree of Life"" as slow-paced and I think it is one of the most inspirational movies ever made. ""Tree of Life"" conveys ideas with a flow of images more often than words. Through images and occasional dialogue and narratives, it leaves bread crumbs for audience to find the clues. I thought it was brilliant and the way, it showed me, intrigued me and carried me emotionally to the end.

Now, about ""Breaking Bad,"" it is very slow-paced because it showed me everything and that wasn't enough, it also told me everything. I got bored in the middle of first season but I really tried to like the series so I continued. I even started to draw (my past time hobby) while ""watching"" the episodes because I didn't really have to watch it anymore. Just by hearing it, I could learn everything about the story.

The WORST was all the screaming, yelling, arguing and tearing. Well, that wasn't as severe as Korean/Taiwanese drama shows, but it was just too much for me. I guess that is why it is so popular ... I mean look at all the reality shows. Doesn't the audience love reality TV people yelling at each other in TV? 9.5/10 on IMDb ... well, Iron Man 3 has 7.4/10 and tree of life as 6.7/10. This tells me everything and so sad ... so sad."
6.0,14 April 2020,"Breaking the old framework, the law and committing crimes to do crazy things that a dull person can't do.

From the begining to the end of the series episodes are written so well, the suspens is perfectly balanced, never too much but always enough.

Always action but not overwhelming and still easy to understand. The serious tone is managed in an amazing way without doing too much but keeping the spectators fixed to their screens wondering what will happen next.

9.0,15 September 2024,"I am proud of the fact that the actors entered each role very skillfully, studied the role, felt it from the inside and lived in the role and brought the character to life. The look in the eyes, the actions, the reactions, all those things could be true. Among the main characters, Walter White, his wife Skyler, Saul, Micheal and Jesse seem to me to be real people. However, it is wonderful that the author was able to think about real life without leaving out the plot, characters, events, real human behavior, the real and hard truths of life, plot twists, and the ultimate goals of the actors. I am grateful, proud and worshipful that the director has brought this wonderful story to us as a film."

10.0,20 January 2019,"This is the only series that gets better every single season. The personalities are very natural, very human. Their mistakes are even correlated to their previous experiences in life. Everything matches. In my opinion nobody could've done a better acting than Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, they are just perfect for their roles. Not just them, every single character in the series is perfect for their role. This series is simply amazing. The main message in the series is ""wake up, life is too short, live on your own terms"""
10.0,7 October 2023,"It was Good But definitely not a 9.5/10

Most episodes were just plain boring no excitement, yeah the writing was good but... Nothing special

I don't know or understand how this show got so many 10/10 reviews. I have to agree the writing was good, but after a while I found a lot of it redundant. It was simple- two guys manufacture meth, they need a distributor, they find a distributor,their partnership goes sour with their distributor, they find a way to kill their distributor, rinse, repeat....add in a little moral questioning, some bromance and there you have it- how to write ""Breaking Bad.""

Tv shows with lower ratings that In my personal opinion i think Is much superior to BB. (Prison break). (Suits)

Again, just my opinion."

I just LOVE this show. They did a excellent job with this show. it will always be one of my favorite shows of all time."
10.0,20 September 2024,"Breaking Bad"" is undoubtedly one of the greatest television series ever made. The show follows the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin, after being diagnosed with cancer. The intelligent writing, complex characters, and outstanding performances (especially by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul) make this series a thrilling masterpiece.

Walter White's psychological evolution, along with his interactions with other characters like Jesse Pinkman and Hank, keep you emotionally invested in every moment. Each episode is packed with suspense and twists, highlighting both the human and darker sides of the characters. The pacing is meticulous, building tension in ways that leave you on the edge of your seat.

The final episodes are a perfect culmination, delivering a powerful and satisfying conclusion. Overall, ""Breaking Bad"" is an unforgettable experience filled with moral dilemmas, intense drama, and thrilling storytelling. If you're looking for a series that's gripping, masterfully written, and emotionally resonant, this is the show for yo."

The writing, the character development, the cinematography, the music, the acting. It's so perfect it feels like they released the show took feedback off the fans and then went back in time to release a perfected version! You literally couldn't make it better.

The way it escalates and continues to get better is so impressive and the ending my lawd if you haven't watched it 3 times you need to watch it 3 times and then another 3 times"
10.0,11 August 2011,"This show is better than nearly every movie coming out of Hollywood. Those clowns that spend 100 million dollars to make crappy movies that rely only on CGI and explosions could learn so much from a show that likely costs a couple million...for the whole season!!! The show has fully developed characters, incredible plot twists, slow suspense peppered with just enough shock and horror to leave you on the edge of your seat. It is also funny at times.

The only bad thing is each episode is so good the time flies and you must wait an entire week in suspense to watch again. Few shows in history have that quality. The only one in recent memory that was just as good and quite similar with the suspense, characters etc. was the rebooted and much darker Battlestar Galactica series that ran on Sci-Fi a few years ago (also called the best show on TV at that time by Newsweek, TV guide etc.). ....Two of the best shows I've ever seen hands down"
10.0,5 April 2023,The point is actually not the jokes on the series but there was something else that everyone may notice that this series has too many slow scenes i mean i cant understand why its like that. Always feels bad while watching it. Yea maybe the director wants it that way but look what happen now. A show that goes slower than a tortoise. Characters are actually good on their jobs cant say anything about that one. Walter white was on bad way and u cant know whats next while hes trying to make things right. I guess that was the thing making you to sit there and watching that slow damn show. Thank you hank for your creepy laugh making our face smile just a little bit in that drama. The show can be on top 5 but not 1. U can personally love it yourself and put it on top 1 but sadly ur the one of the under age audience. I still cant understand why this series has 10 9.9 rated episodes on it. Oh sorry i already know why actually. Less tiktok for all of yall.
7.0,18 May 2012,
1.0,12 October 2019,I binged watched this series last year and never felt outdated. Brilliantly penned by Vince Gilligan. Jesse pinkman and hank are two characters I liked a lot. Hank was the true protagonist in this anti hero series. 10/10 recommend if you haven't watched it yet
10.0,26 January 2020,"The character development dipped mid-season. Walter White was not a good liar. They dragged this on for too long, but the consistent tension was entertaining. Their artistic license set the bar quite high. It's the little things, the mechanisms and techniques of simple day to day routines magnified, perfect angles and scene transitions, excellent camera work, authentic depictions of culture, gangster or otherwise, which all add up to produce something extraordinary. Gilligan is our modern Hitchcock. He isn't pretentious. He understands less is more. No cinematic ten-second aerial motion shots of nature, nor does he commit the sin, in my opinion, modern directors seem to embrace, which is constant camera movement. Bad directors abuse the camera, not to mention play inappropriate background music, to hide a weak plot."

10.0,21 May 2020,"First of all, I have seen Breaking Bad series after watching Ozark. It's bit too late to watch one the most famous shows of all time right ?

That's ok. Neither the title nor the poster make feel to watch. However, due numerous recommendations from friends, I decided to give it a try.

I would like to draw parallels between Ozark and Breaking Bad. Walter White character has certain shades which will not let you understand what's in his mind. On a contrary Marty Byrde character remains predictable and proves its worth in each situation throughout the seasons.

Jesse Pinkman vs Ruth Langmore: Ozark team believed in Ruth Langmore. They gave ample space and script to showcase the complex emotions in the heart of Ruth Langmore. On a contrary, Jesse merely supports/admires/have to support Walter emotions throughout. Probably, creators of Breaking Bad too might have felt the same and released 'El Camino' movie. I haven't seen the movie yet. Probably I will.

Helen Pierce vs Saul Goodman: This is indeed a tough comparison. Isn't it ? I love the character of Saul Goodman. However, I am more convinced with Helen Pierce characterization as a lawyer to mafia.

I would remain sad, If I don't mention Hank Schrader character. What if I say: I like the script work done for Hank Schrader character: It is more convincing, heartfelt, truthful, and most importantly it won't deserve to disappear in the hands of funny gang and hopeless Walter in a situation where good Jesse hides under a car?

However, Breaking Bad will remain in top list of suggested shows to watch. May be, because Walter White won't let you forget him after all :) I have the option of giving rating from 5 to 8. I go with 6. I have already stated the reasons I suppose :)

Please give it a try, if you like drama genre."
10.0,18 June 2019,"Finally was convinced to watch the show due to all the hype. Was watching with the wife and reached the third season...wow, it felt like forever. After an episode in season 3 i just came out and told the wifey ""I can't do this anymore, I can't watch this"". She looked me in my eyes and the relief I saw was heartwarming, she agreed! I seriously don't know what all that hype was about!"
10.0,10 November 2019,"Watched this whole series from start to finish within 2 weeks. Binge watched it most of the times. Can't express how amazing this is. The acting, the action, everything is 100%."
10.0,22 June 2019,😍When art mixes with science it produces us breaking bad
10.0,6 July 2022,"A slowdown in the events and an accurate and enjoyable explanation of the story, then the greatness comes at the end, making you stick to the characters from one season to the next. I really envy the one who did not watch it. What are you waiting for? You have a lot of fun, this one."
10.0,24 May 2019,"This series is unbelievably good. The writing, the cinematography, the acting, the drama and the perfect ending. Must watch."
10.0,8 February 2021,The concept of this show breaks the stereotype of Bryan Cranston who used to play comedic or dare I say roles not like the complex character of Walter White. A lot of lovable characters with a lot of depth. the acting of the entire ensemble is amazing and all the episodes end out on a cliffhanger which add much more interest to the story. Definitely the best show I've seen in a long time and would also recommend to people with the interest in a Crime-Drama genre.
10.0,30 April 2020,"The whole thing is absolutely stunning! got stuck in the story so much, the characters get so own that They become emotions for a long time. running out of words to praise i guess. Loved it!"
6.0,6 May 2024,"This is a must watch, especially if you don't want something very sci-fi and something more realistic with some action as well. You really should give it a try if you never watched it. Make sure you keep in mind all the small details this show will present you at the first seasons. For some people the first season was pretty boring, but if it is in your case i recommend you keep going because this show is getting better and better each season, and in the end i bet it's going to blow your mind, very good show overall and definitely a must watch if you are a fan of Crime Drama Series or Action shows that aren't so sci-fi."
1.0,25 October 2019,Best drama series ever made!!!hats off to all team behind breaking bad
10.0,17 May 2021,"Love, Friends, Drugs, Family, etc... You name it, it got all.!

It's awesome, to see how interesting, how thrilling a show can be made.

It has its own pace, once you got set it does everything.!"
10.0,15 June 2017,
10.0,6 November 2014,"I don't know why people are praising this show, there's no substance for about 70% of the time, just talking about something that doesn't impact the story.

The characters are very dull, and lacking in well character. I feel as though they are just there to look at; they don't connect with the character, I don't feel anything for them - which means that I don't care if they live or die - which means that I'm not in suspense at all.

There's about 3 good scenes in the whole of the show but 'Mythbusters' proved them all to be wrong and so unreal that it makes the chemistry feel cheap.

This show may appeal to some people but it really doesn't deserve 1/4 of the hype that it has.

Don't watch it, you'll be wasting your time."
10.0,4 June 2019,I was late getting into this. I fly a lot around the world so had plenty of plane time to watch this. I knocked out the complete series in less than two weeks. It's unreal. literally unreal.
10.0,11 October 2019,"The best serie I've seen. It has good performances, a great script and everything a person look for in serie."
10.0,24 August 2019,"I didn't watch it when it aired. I watched it in 2019 and I cannot believe what I almost missed out on! Incredible, amazing show that keeps you on the edge of your seat. I wish I could erase my memory and watch it again for the first time. Hats off to the creators, the actors, and everyone involved in this project."
10.0,12 November 2019,"I never took Drug, But its feel like crystal meth. When i finished watching, my feeling was like expression of Tuco, Badger, etc, when they take crystal meth with inhaling. That Goddamn Feeling!!!!!"
10.0,17 September 2024,"Breaking Bad completely blew me away. I was in Central Africa, with limited internet access, and decided to download the show on a whim. I started watching, and I couldn't stop. The characters and story were so compelling that I found myself completely engrossed.

I've never been so affected by a show before. It's like I'm still trying to process everything that happened. I even saw a comment on YouTube that perfectly captured my feelings: 'I finished Breaking Bad, and I don't know what to do with my life'.

Breaking Bad is a show that will stay with you long after you've finished watching it. It is a complex and thought-provoking series. If you are looking for a show that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you think about the meaning of life, Breaking Bad is definitely worth watching."
6.0,6 August 2019,"The Best Show ever Created

You will watch it more than once

(Watched it 8 times)"
1.0,1 March 2020,I have never done reviews but I just have to do one for this show. This is by far the best show i've seen and im sure this will be the best show i will ever watch. Im sure every other show u will watch after BB will be boring and not good for you. I wish i could destroy my memories and watch this show again. From the story to the every little detail is made just perfect. If you are changing your mind to watch or not watch this show...dude just watch because it is an art and you wont regret it i believe it.
10.0,11 May 2021,One thing I tell about this show is that it has greatest ending ever in a series. Last season tells about life and the way time changes.
10.0,17 April 2021,"For me Breaking Bad is THE BEST TV Drama Series period. It even out rank Game of Thrones (because of that horrible disasterous final season).

BB has everything, Drama, Suspense, Somehow comic, and Intelligent, and in a perfect balance. Sure this show doesn't have the amazing CGI excellence and the Colossal scenes of GOT, but This show makes up for it with Fantastic Real world Family and Crime Drama, The quick short cut of drug business solution for their financial troubles, the innocence, quick thinking and wit of this Walter White Character puts you on the edge of your seat at the end of every episode. And The Character Growth is Just Fabulous on all character. I just love the twists and suspense not knowing what is going to happen in the next episode.

Anyway this show is highly recommended."
10.0,18 January 2020,"I didn't ""hate"" it. I mean I watched all 5 seasons finally, years after not finding much to keep my interest in the first few episodes. Reviews here, several friends, and what seems to be near unanimous opinion about the greatness of Breaking Bad brought me back.

The acting is first rate. The story premise and cinematography really deliver the proverbial goods. As an anti hero, the Walter White character is as good as they come, maybe the best.

But.

But, but, but. I kept waiting for some kind of breakthrough moment or episode where I could identify with a character enough to root for them. Sort of with Aaron Paul's character Jesse and his raw humanity sometimes. But the characters were so flawed in ways that weren't just human shortcomings, they were cartoonishly simple personalities. I don't think it was the acting, it was too consistent across characters. I mean moustache-twirling Mexican bad guys and chronically PMS'ing wives don't engage me even in a hyper-realistic set/scene with decent dialogue.

I'm glad that I watched it all the way through. I don't regret the time spent and now I will be less likely to miss popular culture references to this series.

But.

But, but, but. I think it's pretty overrated. I'm unlikely to ever watch it again."
10.0,29 December 2014,"Best show in TV ever? Master Piece? Yeah, right! Its good, but its NOT THAT GOOD! Read so much about this show, got the whole 5 season to to find the critics were so off! First of all, the script was boring, dull and predictable. Terminally ill chemistry teacher X mid life crisis? A recipe for yawn! As for acting, to be fair, Bryan Cranston is good, better than Liev Schreiber in Ray Donovan, but definitely could not beat James Spader in Black List and Kevin Spacey as FU for the Golden Globe 2013! When I binge on the Black List and Utopia I wished everyday had 48 hours and wish it would never end. With Breaking Bad, after the first season I basically dozed through the second season and then just turning it on while working just for the heck of it."
10.0,15 September 2024,"Wow, I could say so much about this series, but I can only think of one thing: masterpiece! Unfortunately, I only started and finished the series recently (I should have watched it sooner). After the end, I still had to process a lot of things ending the way they did. No matter which episode or which season. It was exciting the whole time and you developed a stronger bond with the characters. In my opinion, this series will always stay at number 1 simply because the story is so well written and the actors put in an outstanding performance. I don't want to give you any spoilers, just start the series, you won't regret it. Thank you for everything."
10.0,21 November 2018,"Honestly one of the best shows I've ever watched. You don't have to be into drugs to watch it. Although the premise of the show is about the manufacturing of drugs, what really makes the story compelling is the characters. Top notch acting, combined with strong character development. If you want to watch a show in which every character on screen has something imteresting or exciting about them, than this is the show for you. If you want to watch a show in which the end of every episode makes you wonder: ""How on earth will they get out of this dilemma?"" Than this is the show for you. Breaking bad doesn't give you cheap, quick, flashy action scenes, instead it knows exactly how to create psychological tension and how to build up the anticipation, before it gives you an amazing, action- or drama-filled pay off. Truly one of the greats."
10.0,2 April 2020,"I've watched a LOT of TV. Breaking Bad is the very best I've ever seen from start to finish. It grabs you in episode #1 and it never lets go. So many great characters, but Jesse & Walt are flawless. A perfect odd couple whose journey explores their characters in a depth I've never seen from another show. They were brilliant throughout."
10.0,1 July 2019,The best series. It is the script and the direction that makes it special
7.0,24 August 2024,"Generally I'm too lazy to review anything but BB just deserves it.

I've watched this more times than I can count and it never gets old or boring. Every re-watch I notice something new and it amazes me. I wish I could erase my memory and watch it afresh.

Amazing characters, cinematography, acting, score and script. Not one moment of screen time is wasted.

It does start slow and maybe there is not enough action for some people early on but would say to anyone who thinks that to persevere. It's so worth it.

It has spoiled me for any other series. And, unlike other series, it ends correctly.

It leaves a void though so El Camino and BCS need to be watched also."
1.0,13 May 2021,Best super awesome extraordinary unbelievable fantastic. Best actor.
9.0,27 November 2019,"Greatest Show of All Time. Perfect all the way through. Great story that puts a strain on your moral compass, great acting, great execution, and a great ending to all of it, which so many shows fail at. 10/10"
10.0,20 July 2020,"I watched Breaking Bad when it was first aired and, I guess, was one of those irritating people saying 'OMG you haven't seen it????' While waiting for the next season of the (almost equally excellent Better Call Saul), and being locked down with not much else to do decided to watch it all again. Despite knowing where everything was going was still absolutely compelled to 'just watch one more' after every episode. Start to finish in a week, I love The Wire, The Sopranos, GoT etc but for me Breaking Bad is untouchable. The dialogue, the humour, the character arcs, the drama, the tension, the action and the 'Oh My God' moments are unsurpassed!"
10.0,28 March 2013,
10.0,20 October 2015,"Breaking bad is a good show but fails to achieve greatness on multiple levels due to a combination of bad acting, unrealistic writing and lack of grit.

Brysan Cranston plays Walter White who is terminally ill high school chemistry teacher who decides to leave his family with a substantial sum of money to support them in the future by cooking meth. There is no denying that Cranston is fine actor but the supporting cast and where the show gets let down the most.

The supporting characters do not come across as believable either with their dialogue or actions and sadly their acting is less than desirable. Like so many before it the show strives to show ""true"" grit but fails like so many American shows, I don't know whether it is the lighting or make up but everything is too shiny and clean and this is a common problem with American shows compared to British shows, which do often capture the rough and crude far better.

Breaking bad is good show but nothing special but worth a watch is nothing else is on."

10.0,11 July 2019,After watching the last season of GOT I think we can make it official - Breaking Bad is the GOAT. Superior writing and character development. Fantastic drama in every episode. Only wish it could have gone on longer.
7.0,3 June 2019,Kind of cringe writing reviews but this deserves the 10 stars
3.0,19 April 2020,After all these years.. still afresh in memory and simply the best TV show ever!
10.0,25 December 2018,"I have watched a lot of tv shows, and I impressed many many series but I didn't watch any series like Breaking Bad. It changes my life in terms of many things. It has an amazing scenario and perfect editing. There is no cliche dialogues and it has fantastic dialogues like ""Tarantino style"". Also I cannot explain acting of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. They are really really extraordinary. And director of cinematography.... Oh my goodness! The greatest thing since sliced bread! And and Vince Gilligan.. You are a genius. Thank you very much for this awesome masterpiece! :)"
9.0,21 November 2019,"Just perfect, fantastic , must watch. Disappionted when i watched the movie El Camino...missed Mr White The best of all"
10.0,23 July 2019,"This man Bryan Cranston is an epic actor. Such simplicity, yet so brutal a rare combination. It's a lengthy story told in multiple seasons, yet it was so gripping that I had to binge watch and finish all seasons in just one month, don't know if that is fast enough :)

All the actors were outstanding including Aaron Paul who was the only Actor in this show who could compete with Bryan in terms of performance, however I think everyone did very well as per the characters given to them. This show proves how a well organised and well executed team work can make such simple narrative so very interesting. Such shows are a big source of learning for every viewers & entertainment professionals in many ways.

If you haven't seen it yet, don't miss it. Watch it now."
10.0,27 December 2022,"Ok it is the perfect tv series maybe best of all times ever. Characters and their struggling and changing throughout the time impeccable. You love it after watching it the taste it leaves in your mind timeless.

In the start Walter was naive and cautious just produce the meth and have it sold get the money to support family for the future plans and Pinkman is more willing into break the law but by time they change roles Pinkman becomes a very emotional person and Walter the opposite like they change places. But Walter mainly doing it mainly by manipulating people around himself and sometimes he acts by action.

It would be better in my opinion if Walter to establish a sopranos style family gangster business and having many men under his command to work for him it would be more stunning than the original. I would make Pinkman as his right hand and like his adopted son. Bribing officers from parliament and police and he becomes arespected and feared by his wife and son as he is also a ruthless kingpin. He would fight with rival meth dealers and cartels and have them fall in their knees in front of him. I think it would open to many more episodes with perfect stories and excitement..."
10.0,11 September 2019,"I'm not saying is bad but isn't the greatest either, love the adrenaline, suspense and drama, yes WW is a genius but that's about it. I don't understand what's all the fuss about. And yes, I'm writing this review after watching GOT"
10.0,27 March 2021,"This was just garbage. How the hell dod it received a 9,5? This show totally does not reflect reality when it comes to the drug business. The script is nonsense, storyline as well. I had great difficulty watching it, and wish I didn't waste my time on this."

10.0,7 January 2020,"Three re-watches later and it still provokes a lot of feelings. I still feel the tension as season 5 unfurls and my heart still breaks three or four times even though I know the story so well by now. To mix it up a little, ""Best Lists"" sometimes rank BrBa as #2 or #3 or #4 but nah, this is the benchmark."
10.0,5 April 2020,One word PERFECTION!!!!!!! MIND-BLOWING ONE A CLASSIC MASTERPIECE. THE BEST SHOW NO ONE CAN COMPARE THIS MASTERPIECE TO ANY OF THE SHOWS OUT THERE.

10.0,16 February 2020,"Title says it all, not my type. Just thought I should put this out there"
10.0,10 January 2012,"Breaking Bad is one of those shows that is probably going to divide viewers. Those with strong views against drug consumption, production and sale will not be happy with this show. That would be, however, missing the point somewhat.

Although the main character decides to supplement his income as a high school teacher by producing drugs, this is by all means not an easy journey. The gains are few and far between and the downside of the business, that is the violence and human destruction that come with it, far from glamorise the subject.

The series can be extremely disturbing and, at the same time, extremely funny. The humour is usually dark and will therefore not be to everyone's taste but it is very well achieved in the series. This is more obvious in season 1 rather than on season 2, which grew darker and left me feeling uneasy at the end of each episode. This is a very violent show, both in terms of physical violence, with the usual shootings and general gore that are so prominent on a number of recent television series, but also in terms of human suffering and interaction, as is visible in the depiction of drug addicts.

The characters are generally solid and have enough depth to surprise the viewer. They are not all lovable; some are in fact rather annoying but this does not mean that they are superfluous. The story is good and keeps moving forward at good pace.

As already mentioned, there seems to be a turn to the darker side in season 2. This may tip the balance of the series too much to make it as enjoyable as before, but still makes pretty good viewing."

7.0,4 July 2019,"Everything about Breaking Bad is top notch. The actors they chose absolutely know how to play their roles, and some actors made characters purposely made to be hated great (looking at you skyler). The show has a perfect mix of drama, action and comedy, and includes one of the most funny TV characters of all time (Saul Goodman). I should stop writing this review, just watch the daln series already"
1.0,2 November 2019,"The best show ever made. I dont think any show will come near to this level of quality work. I am confused now what to watch after finishing this.

10.0,26 October 2019,This was a masterpiece..I loved all the episodes and the ending was so good... the acting was perfect and all of you need to watch this show
10.0,18 August 2024,"So basically, I was avoiding this show for over 10 years after it was over. Why? Because I simply was not interested in stories about drugs, which is the only thing I knew about this tv show. Never read anything about it, except description on public imdb page.

In 2024, I decided to give in and see what all the fuss is about. I'll admit, I was not thrilled with first season, but I stuck to it, hoping it would get better. And OH MY GOD... I'm so glad I did that. Not only did it became better, but ended up becoming one of my favorite tv show ever. I finished all 5 seasons in one week. Story is amazingly written and produced, acting is incredible, every character is presented with such persicion (you're just buying what they're selling, you know? (pun intended)) and it ended just how it was supposed to. Nothing was forced or rushed. Everyhing reached it's natural ending. Every character got closure (well, except Jesse, but we have movie ""El camino"" that brings us his closure).

10/10 from me. For anyone who wants to watch it - just avoid all the spoilers. Don't look the show up on google or youtube, because it will show you articles or videos with spoilers in the title. Finish the entire show, and then search for interviews and other stuff online (if you're interested in such things)."
10.0,11 October 2024,"This show is without a doubt, the greatest show ever created. The tension, the drama, the writing and even the humour in this show is incredible. Walter White is one of the greatest characters ever written. The dynamics between characters in this show are fantastic, for example Walter and Jesse. This show also introduces us to the greatest protagonist of all time Gustavo Fring. We are also introduced to one of the most complex characters in television history, Saul Goodman. The acting in this show is also unbelievable, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's performance in this show is breathtaking. If you haven't watched the show already, then please do. You will not regret it."

10.0,12 October 2019,"These series thus far have been very essential for me and people who loves a gripping and thrills series as this is one of the best TV series ever. If you love development with no continuity error, this is for you. If you like intense drama, this is for you. Everything that you would've expect from the series really delivers everything that you want. The last season of the series is the most satisfying one ever and gives closure to its main character. I have watched it twice and it stills gives me the feel to watch it again."
10.0,21 May 2017,"In 2011, this show had a 9.4 out of 50,000 votes meaning that the vast majority watched it after watching the fifth season.I hope people expecting an amazing series don't quit watching after the first 14 episodes

Season 1= 4 out of 7 episodes are good.Overall a watchable season. Rating 7.5/10

Season 2= 4 out of 13 episodes are good.The weakest season by far.The first 7 episodes are complete filler till better call Saul episode.Not to mention the filler is boring as well.But the season ends nicely. Rating 5/10

Season 3= 6 out of 13 episodes are good.Better than the second season but also includes a lot of filler in between.2 good episodes at the start, 2 in the middle and 2 at the end. Rating 7/10

Season 4= 8 out of 13 episodes are good.First 2 are good and 6 at the end.This is where breaking bad starts to truly get good.

Rating 8/10

Season 5= 16 out of 16 episodes are good while last 8 episodes are exceptional.This is the season that truly deserves that 9.5 rating

Overall, I think Breaking bad should have a 9.3 rating according to IMDb standards"
10.0,6 June 2013,"personally this TV series made laugh at several scenes & on several occasion i find myself keep watching the next episodes. But frankly i would recommend to focus on the new generation & give them a message that they need to build qualities that demands sacrifices & persistence in life in order to overcome situations that occurs during their life journey. in this TV show, the ultimate escape was to produce highest quality crystal meth. everyone wants to become a chemistry guru & make easy money now :) If it was me to edit the story, i would have added more negative results so people (the young ones) could learn & avoid it (making $1.2 Million) was an easy job. in these days young people should always build & develop qualities that demands aspiration, patience, persistence, etc.. Matters are qualities no college in the world could teach."
10.0,30 July 2014,
10.0,7 April 2020,"Even its spinoff ""Better Call Saul"" is not as good. What separates Breaking Bad from other ""good"" tv series is the awesome storytelling. There are a lot of good shows on American TV, but none of them really gets it done as perfectly as BB.

Game of thrones is overrated garbage in comparison."
10.0,1 September 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a masterful exploration of human transformation, morality, and the consequences of choices. Created by Vince Gilligan, the series follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, portrayed with chilling brilliance by Bryan Cranston. As Walter delves deeper into the drug trade to secure his family's financial future, his moral compass deteriorates, leading to an irreversible transformation into the ruthless alter ego, Heisenberg.

The show's meticulous writing and character development set it apart. Each episode builds tension, pushing characters to their limits and revealing the darker sides of human nature. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman, Walter's troubled former student and partner, adds emotional depth and complexity to the narrative. The series is also notable for its stunning cinematography and innovative storytelling techniques, including its use of symbolism and foreshadowing.

""Breaking Bad"" is not just a crime drama; it's a profound commentary on the consequences of one's actions, the corrupting influence of power, and the thin line between right and wrong. It's a show that leaves viewers questioning their own moral boundaries, making it one of the most impactful TV series of all time."
7.0,3 February 2020,"Great cinematography, realistic scenes with well-thought out details, continuity, and accurate, accurate substance. Nothing will ever beat this show's place in my heart."
1.0,23 August 2019,Best series ever. Acting and Writing on another level than anything ever made
10.0,21 February 2024,"Breaking Bad was one hell of a show. The show gets better and better with each and every episode.

The journey of Walter white and Jesse are unforgettable. The character arc was insane. The way they both grew into being the best cooks in the field was insane.

The Salamancas (Hector, Tuco, The twins) were so good man, loved them. Gus Fring, the way the character had been written was outstanding and honestly my favorite character in the show hands down.

Walter White's personal life too had so much drama with his wife, the son and daughter. Hank was such a good character, funny one too!

Overall, the greatest show of all time."
10.0,21 July 2022,"I don't think much has to be said about this impeccable film. It's just incredible honestly. The plot, the acting, the directing and pretty much everything about this film is perfect.

Lol I'm not kidding the respect I have for the men (Vince Gilligan & Walter White) is immense and i bet none of my chemistry teachers deserve that. You wouldn't wanna live without watching shows like 'Breaking Bad' periodt. This is simply a great show and i don't think i could ever like express the amount of dedication and affection i have for this show because i literally ran out of my netflix subscription and i was so desperate to continue it that i streamed it on a pirate website, and every single second was worth the attention."
10.0,16 December 2021,"Until something better comes out... this show is just the most consistent from beginning to end. Each season is different but no show has all 5 seasons flow into each other so flawlessly. There's really no low points, just a lot of low morality explored."
10.0,21 November 2011,"In the opening credits, being that part of the show is focused on chemistry, letter combinations in the opening credit names that correspond with element symbols are highlighted, with the first letter of the chemical element capitalized.

The Director of Photography is Michael Slovis (if you read this, great job!). The two letters that are highlighted as a chemical element symbol are the 3rd and 4th letters of his first name (mine as well)... Ch.

But Ch is not a symbol for any element! And we wonder why we are so behind in science compared with other countries! Michael Hogan, PE Chemical Engineer"

Gave 10 out 10 because so good to watch it bout 5 times just gets better better every time I watch it. Character the story lines absolutely brilliant. What a director making this tv series. People say season 3 and upward is better but I think whole season is well good start to finish. My favourite bit of the season when chucks the pizza on the roof. There is one bit boring episode can't remember what is called when there fly in the episode but other than that.
10.0,4 January 2016,"So, the Breaking Bad was a trend. And I watched it. I was sure blinded by the high IMDb score. But when I saw, that separate episodes got bad reviews (average around 7), was even more frustrated, that I spent several hours behind TV and watched this crap.

Why crap? I can't enjoy the show, if the main character isn't a positive one. It could kill, and be in the wrong side of the law. But still, he should have some positive principles.. But not in this show. Main character is lying, he doesn't care about his family, total egoist. And other fella, his partner. Spoiled idiot. That's why I hated this series. Story could be very interesting, but the actors spoiled it."

6.0,13 June 2024,"I watched this series a long time ago and recently had a pleasure of revisiting the show again. I want to say that it actually still amazed me how great this season actually is if not more delightful to watch again. The story is so well written and circles around so many metaphors and foreshadowing which always keeps you on the edge. The gritty and very realistic setting makes it one of the best entertainment out there. The writing and characters have so much depth and so much to offer that everything falls into place perfectly. The duo of Bryan and Paul is something unmatched. The cinematography and small continuity details/easter eggs from Vince Gilligan are something I will always miss in other shows. All in all, if you're interested to watch anything this summer, this is the perfect time to give it a watch or better yet a rewatch!

7.0,11 November 2021,"Apologies in advance for the length, but given the almost universal acclaim afforded this series, I feel compelled to justify why I feel the way I do. TLDR: While Walt's character was at times problematic, the Jesse and Skyler characters' absurd antics ruined what could've been a GREAT series.

First things first. I LOVE to give positive reviews for great content! So this isn't some ""Hating something that everyone else loves, just to be contrary""-type review! That's why I don't mind saying that hands down, ""Breaking Bad"" is a GREAT story with some great characters! The problem in my opinion, is that writing for some of those characters went completely off the rails at some point in season three, and that just ruined the series for me. That said, for me, in order, the best written characters were Mike, Gus, Hank, and Saul -with an honorable mention to Hector Salamanca. The worst by far, were Jessie and Skyler...It wasn't even close. The Walter White character was decently written for the most part, but was diminished by his ridiculous and inexplicable behavior at times.

Listen, I know this was a show about how one's choices can lead to self-destruction, but at times, the choices and behavior of Jessie (Oh...My...God!), Skyler, and Walt, were not even REMOTELY realistic. At every turn, Jessie's overwrought and completely over-the-top reactions and behaviors kept him, Walter, Gus, Mike, and their whole enterprise either on the brink of discovery by law enforcement, imprisonment, or death.

Simply put, much of Jesse's behavior was stupid and contrived. It was completely absurd that ANYONE, let alone a brilliant, extremely cautious drug kingpin and successful business man, and his dying, genius chemist that's quietly trying to leave a financial legacy for his family, would continue to have such a mentally and emotionally unstable, ticking timebomb drug addict like Jesse, within a thousand miles of a quarter-billion dollar, illegal drug enterprise...Let alone as a key player. But ok, sure! Of COURSE! THIS is the guy you want to keep around. NOT the brilliant, ""once-in-a-lifetime, golden-goose"" chemist, with the perfected drug manufacturing process that produces a product unmatched by ANY competitor, and capable of generating potentially billions of dollars in future revenue. How stupid of me?

Then there's Skyler, who was exaggerated, hypocritical, inconsistent, a ""harpy"", and also perpetually overwrought. First she is justifiably outraged and fearful, but then does a complete 180 for the trivialest of reasons. This is a character who had the sheer brilliance and chutzpah to contrive a perfectly believable character such as the ""Bimbo Bookkeeper"" on a moment's notice, and deliver such a great performance, that she believably pulls the wool over the eyes of an investigator who's trained and primed to spot dishonesty and scams, yet, a few scenes later, this SAME character was so pathetically transparent and incapable of believably denying outrageous accusations that were based on little more than a ""hunch"", that she all but confirmed both the accusations AND her knowledge and involvement. It was completely ridiculous.

And finally Walt. Whereas Jesse's behavior at times could be somewhat attributed to the fact that he was at core, an immature man-child idiot, and loser meth addict, the same could not be said of Walt. Walt was an extremely intelligent, degreed, presumably rational man, who in most instances, should've been capable of logically assessing a given situation, and formulating a reasonable response -which he utterly failed to do in too many instances. Too many times, where he should have been forceful and indignant in response, he was subdued and unconvincing. Other times, where calm and level-headedness would have carried the day, he was irrational, manic and out-of-control.

From some point early in the third season, I literally began just fast forwarding through pretty much all of Skyler's scenes, and a LOT of Jesse's because his character had become pretty hopeless by that point. I mean playing ""Jesse Hood"" and literally throwing away money? Are you serious? I think that was the point at which I pretty much threw in the towel and began FF-ing through the rest of the episodes, except where scenes appeared pivotal to the series' inevitable outcome.

Finally, to those who would argue, ""Well what would you have had them do? If they didn't make mistakes...blah, blah, blah"", I'd say look at Al Pacino in ""Scarface"". There's an example of a story of self-destruction, but unlike Breaking Bad, Scarface was mostly plausible and well written. Or how about one of the best written TV shows in history, about a whole GROUP of ""bad decision-making"", self-destructive people, ""The Sopranos""? Sorry, but it's completely possible to write such a story with believable characters, who behave realistically. Unfortunately, too often, the writing for this series ""broke bad"" (sorry, couldn't resist...lol), and ruined what could've been one of the all-time great TV shows!"
4.0,27 February 2024,"You know a series is gonna be incredibly good when you fall in love with it right on the first episode.

From the unique storyline and characters to the amazing way every single episode goes along in an incredibly original and complex way that will always leave me astonished.

To all of this sums some of the smoothest editing transitions and epic music choice.

Every single character is portrayed exactly how it should be, and the diversity and inclusion of every single one of them is incredible.

Even though you might not like these types of series or you don't really get it at all it's ok, everyone has their likings... But you cannot deny the way this show was made is absolutely brilliant..."

10.0,16 October 2020,"You will never watch anything like that again! to me there's no TV show comparable to this one. the outstanding performance of Bryan Cranston will give you a Rollercoaster of feelings. not only the story and background is amazing and I believe close to maybe some destinies out there, but also the whole set up of the series, the production and direction was utterly clever."

10.0,23 February 2018,"I really wonder how this hustler paid himself #3 top rated series. And Hannibal, which's better than Breaking bad, standing on the right spot"
6.0,29 September 2024,"This show is good, but it's good in the same way as all the other great dramas are and none of them have a 9.5+ rating on imdb. I do think Breaking Bad is praised highly by people who have not seen many other TV shows in their life. It's like Vanilla ice cream that people praise without trying other flavors.

The show anchors itself on the constant, ""what will happen to them next"" idea. For me, it worked, for a season and a half, and finally didn't care anymore. There is truly nothing that wrong with the show, but the foundation of the show is very unrealistic and it paints itself as detailed-oriented and serious, but then in the same breathe, treats itself as a not-so-serious black comedy. Which is why I think some people think this show glorifies drugs and criminal activity, because even though many things bad happens to them, its actually not that serious and they actually get away with extremely illegal shit and benefit from it. Aka, their repercussions are not in ratio to the illegal stuff they are doing.

The best part about this show is the writing, and the writing is really all they ride on which means the show will have a lot of long drawn out ""in rooms"" scene of people purely just talking. The problems, I had with this show that gave it a 6/10 is that it shows two boneheads in Pinky in the Brain style, where they are actually both stupid and overreact to bad things in a comedic style which really took away the seriousness of the show and the caliber of their dilemma.

The reason for all of this to snowball out of control was not even worth it in the first place and the family life juxtaposition within the show was actually grading more than it was suspenseful."
2.0,11 June 2021,After hearing about the show for years I decided to give it a try. I have to say I only made it about 2 1/2 episodes before I had to stop. I just didn't care about any of the characters. There's nobody in the show did I give a hoot about anything about them.
10.0,11 April 2020,"I usually don't watch TV series and everyone I know says I missing out onit. One of my friends told me to start by watching breaking bad and I thought I'd give it ago. I was abit late because this series ended in 2013. So I binge watch the whole 5 seasons in 1 week and I'm so glad I did. All I can say is ""PERFECTION"" You cannot get a better script or storyline better than this. Advice watch it if you haven't already. Now I can't wait to watch Saul on call and El Camino."

10.0,12 October 2019,"I would say the first season is not very catchy, it is a bit boring, but it is totally necessary for the development of the series. Each season increases the intensity and the desire to see more. I don't know anyone who has seen this series and was not amazed. Extraordinary performances by the entire cast."
10.0,1 May 2020,Absolute masterpiece... Hands down the best tv series ever!!!
10.0,3 February 2021,"Breaking Bad could be considered the best TV Show of all time, mainly due to its consistency. Breaking Bad has been equally great through every season. The acting, characters, story, pacing, everything is amazingly done. The only issue that I have with the show is that it gets a little redundant in the middle seasons. But an issue like that changes from person to person, so depending on your interest, you might get hooked, or loose interest near the end. But aside from that, the show practically has no problems. So if you're in need of a good show to watch, Breaking Bad should be the first pick."
7.0,4 February 2021,Not much to say except this show is the best ever made.
1.0,29 September 2021,"Is it just me or this series suffers a downgrade from the 3rd season?

First and second seasons are a solid 9 afterwards it gets repetitive, lack of ideas and unnecessary scenes.

Overall is great drama and I am not amazed from the high rating of it 9.4."
10.0,23 December 2014,"This has got to be one of the worst TV shows of all time. What do you people see in it? I wanted all the characters killed off except for Saul and the cop. Plot's dull. Story lines stupid. The women characters are weak and the show make them all look like bickering airheads. Maybe it's because USA is full of druggies and that's why they like it so much? Games of Thrones and Hell on Wheels are thousand times better than this terrible, terribleshow. There's wit and substantive dialogue. I had a terrible migraine after finishing the 2nd season of Breaking Bad. Maybe people can related b/c they all do drugs. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure this out."
10.0,15 August 2019,"There is not even a close second. Best TV acting, script. Just get thru the slow first season and you will be hooked for life."

Every episode is filled with full drama and action you never know what's gonna happen next.

6.0,2 September 2019,"This is what perfection looks like folks, I'm not a huge tv show fan, I think a lot of tv shows go overlong due to the appeal, money, and attention, breaking bad though, delivers 100% and more. The rewatch value is insane. The show pays off through every weak point you may feel pays off. Breaking Bad does more than break bad, it breaks the barrier that most tv shows can't seem to break through. It breaks through the cliches, trends and overlong played out seasons, ending in a actual ending. Instead of leaving so much questions behind it actually finishes. It is an amazing show period and the greatest tv show ever."

10.0,6 January 2012,"To be honest i don't know why this TV series is being called one of the best shows ever created by critics. In series 1 you are introduced to the characters and Walter finds out about his cancer. Nearly all the episodes in the first season are slow paced but this isn't always a bad thing but sometimes it is for example a man is kept in a basement for 4 episodes and you may not think this is long but it is for a 7 episode series. And also the whole show is suppose to be about Walter and Jesse cooking and selling meth, however they barely sell any in the first season. To be honest the only thing that kept me watching was the amazing acting. And it was only from a few characters...everyone was on top form. The second season is where the show starts getting good. No episode is slow paced and now there is some guaranteed action such as a shootout or fights. Unlike the first series where there was barely any action violence. Also This is a 13 episode season which i think is a good amount of episodes. Also everything is on a bigger scale like the deals, buyer, and basically all situations and trust me its keeps getting better from here."

Friends and family have told me stories of getting up at 3am in the morning to fit in 'just one more episode in', constant late nights and going home at lunch time to catch another hour. You can also heighten your enjoyment by watching better call Saul first (8/10) and add el Camino (7/10) on the end to finish it off. Nothing else comes close."

5.0,16 May 2019,"You don't need a big budget, more protagonists than you can count on your fingers and mind boggling visual effects to tell a good story, and no other show I've watched better embodies this truth than Breaking Bad. It relies solely on its characters, its story, and the deeply grounded reality it takes place in. Nothing in this show is extravagant, or over-the-top, and it never relies on visual razzmatazz to attract audiences. Having said that, I have to give credit where credit is due, because this show has some of the best cinematography I've ever witnessed. Michael Slovis, Vince Gilligan, and all the directors attached to the show have labored to give us some truly jaw dropping shots, from the vast endless New Mexican deserts to time lapse shots of Albuquerque to POV shots of a fly. Then there's the acting, which is simply phenomenonal. A couple of episodes in, you'll completely forget that these are actors pretending to be fictional characters. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul in particular deliver some groundbreaking performances. The story is also amazing. The writers always find new and unexpected ways to both subvert our expectations and reward them. Some of the best episodes in the series are ""One Minute,"" ""Ozymandias,"" and, ""Crazy Handful of Nothin'"". Not to say the others are bad; far from it. The lowest rated BB episode ""Fly"" is considered by those who support it as a work of art. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will. Ultimately, the reason this show is so popular is because it always strived to outdo itself, without ever trying to jump the shark. It kept on getting better and better, and before the possibility of becoming mediocre had even reared its ugly head the showrunners ended the show, at its very peak. It never outstayed its welcome, it never disappointed, and it never made a narrative misstep. BB is the GOAT."
10.0,8 October 2024,"It's nice to watch but it's so overrated And this Walter character is so provocative form the beginning till the end couldn't sympathize with him not even a little bit And i don't knwo what's the issue with his white underwear! I mean come on people what's the idea of keep showing is his ridiculous white underwear!

I wonder if the main goal was to hate the character from the beginning if that's so they are brillaint !

The story is so brilliant but so cliche at so many points Also the series was so boring in the first 3 seasons that i hardly kept pushing myslef to continue watching, i mean can you imagine a whole episode was about trying to catch a fly in the lab !!!"

10.0,12 July 2024,"Breaking Bad spans five seasons, each unique and special. While it starts slow, the series evolves into a masterpiece, particularly shining in Seasons 4 and 5, solidifying its place as the greatest TV series of all time.

The character ark of Walter White's jounrey from a poor high school Chemistry Teacher with cancer to a wealthy Drug Lord is the most interesting representation egotistical mindset that is Walter White. The cinematography, orchestrated by Vince Gilligan, is stunning with beautifully moments of composed shots and angles.

The acting from many characters in the show mainly Bryan Cranston (Walter White), Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring), Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman), along with many more is truly remarkable and deeply affecting. From Season 1- 5 the tone of the show becomes more serious and very few moments of humor are seen.

Starting with no expectations in 2022, I now firmly believe: WATCH Breaking Bad-it's the pinnacle of television history!"
10.0,2 May 2020,"I started to see this show in 2020, yes I know it's too late to see this masterpiece, but let me explain it for those who has not seen this yet. The show is absolutely boring in 1st and 2nd season, but as you enter the 3rd season the atmosphere is sticked to your mind and in my opinion the 4th and 5th seasons are the best. The progress you see in Walter's personality is awesome. You have definitely to watch this show. As I said, the negative part is only about the slow pace in the earliest seasons, other than that, this is an incredible show."
10.0,26 July 2019,"Breaking Bad is no question the best TV Series of all time. No other TV series can complete with its story, acting, dialogues and emotional context presented by Vince Gilligan. The 🐐"

The way the story is told and the character development is insane. I loved de plot and how everything got shape by the time the show developed.

Everything, from the beggining to the end was really interesting.

Something I loved about the show was the actor's interpretation of each character. All of the did a great job. It was easy to love or hate then or to feel identified with some of them.

The plot was amazing too. It is something special, no wasted potencial in my opinion.

If you haven't seen it yet, I completely do recommend it, worths a shot."

7.0,30 August 2014,"10/10 TV-Series, it's absolutely great. The acting is AWESOME! Especially by Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston. The other actors do a good job too, but the duo is the main deal here and the most important characters of course.

First when i tried this show out back in spring of 2014, i could not get into it. I tried watching it but i got bored and stuff, because i kind of have A.D.D . But now i just gave it a shot not long ago, and WOAH! It's a GREAT TV Show! Straight up there in my book with the other awesome ones. I have to give it a 10/10 rating because it is just PERFECTION.

Thrilling TV Series, with 5 seasons full of goodies. I've heard, and I mostly agree that, season by season, the show just keeps on getting better until.... it's OVER."
1.0,15 June 2010,"The only TV series 'Breaking Bad' can be compared with, in my opinion, is The Sopranos.

I know they have completely different story lines, but still, they're both great Dramas. Even though Breaking Bad has more action and some thrill, they are in many ways alike.

I'm not here to compare them but to talk about what makes Breaking Bad such a excellent show. To begin with, it is produced by AMC, a channel which never disappoints in the matter of quality of TV series they air. The actors and performances are very good and intense (and that's at least a plus two in a TV drama), the writing is very solid and coherent, and the direction of each episode is masterfully done.

Bryan Cranston was one of my favorite comedy TV actors of all time since Malcolm in the Middle (FOX), and it's very nice to see how he evolved in a very positive way to drama television.

These are the seasons I give it a reasonable 10/10. And I'm sure you would give it too, if you just give this excellent show a chance to prove it's worth it."
10.0,26 December 2023,"I must be the only one who would be writing such review.... HAHA. Probably the only one with such low rating.

The acting, music, cinematography, production was perfect.

Walter, Jesse, Gus and Saul were the 4 horsemen.... Outstanding acting by the respective actors.

The story was really great especially the climax.

But it was incredibly slow, nothing happens for multiple episodes and maybe one or 2 moment of thrill.

Everything was great but still never connected to the show. It felt really boring & unexciting.

But everyone would agree on one thing, Skylar is the worst of all, hated her so much."
10.0,15 September 2019,"Really was boring, I think this will get a lot of dislikes but that's what I'm going for with this one.

It's just so overrated in my opinion that I can't actually believe it became so popular."
10.0,11 September 2020,"When my partner and I finally reached the conclusion of the final episode it genuinely felt like a colossal weight had been lifted off our lives. We'd been watching Breaking Bad, off and on, since 2013 or thereabouts and had been avoiding spoilers with severe intent for years. I'd run away from conversations. I once jumped off a bridge when someone said ""Walt-"". I ONCE LEAPT FROM A ZEPPELIN UPON HEARING THE WORD ""METH"".

Rian Johnson said, I think, the most succinct quote on the enduring appeal of Breaking Bad which essentially amounted to ""the characters matter"". For me this has to be the big takeaway here - this was a show, regardless of the overarching themes, regardless of the symbolism and commentary you can read into it, that is fundamentally one of the most undiluted character pieces in television history. Given that Gilligan's original framework was ""what if our protagonist became an antagonist over the course of a show"" it essentially means that character progression is welded into the architecture of the format and it is genuinely beautiful to witness.

That is not to say that it doesn't stumble, and its initial season (although hampered and ultimately helped by the writer's strike) is structurally uneven and it's still hard to compress the seven years we watched it to the two years it's meant to be set across. To my mind it also doesn't quite pull off the balance of tension and release til its midpoint - and fails to really perfect it until the flawless final season. I've also had scores of people telling me they much prefer its more tonally rounded prequel Better Call Saul - which is absolutely fair enough as Gilligan himself admits that the final pitch-black descent was extremely uncomfortable to follow through on.

At its best though, there really isn't anything else like it, another jewel in the crown of the medium and certainly deserving of all the hype it gets. Like one of Jesse's perfectly crafted, meticulously constructed imaginary wooden boxes. Yes it's now a weight off the mind, but a rather wonderful one. I'll still leap from zeppelins of course, because I DON'T WANT TO GET SPOILED FOR THE SOPRANOS."

10.0,30 September 2013,"Amazing. Fantastic. Wonderful. Dramatic. Intense. Terrific. Fabulous. Tremendous. I can't come up with enough adjectives to describe how great this show is. I didn't even know what it was about when I started watching it, which made it that much better. I started watching it on Netflix after the system hounded me endlessly to try it, and finished it on cable, since Netflix didn't have the last episodes.

What's so great about it? BB is about family. It's about craziness. It's about corruption. It's about the love of money. It's about the contradiction between our public vs private personas. It's about fear, love, hate, happiness, sadness, and indifference. It's about conflicts, children, and the monotony of suburban existence. It's about being human. Everyone can relate to something in the show. Even if somehow you can't, it hooks you from the very start. This is coming from a person who is very picky about TV. I have never seen a show as awesome as this one. I urge you to give it a try."
10.0,11 August 2020,"Where do I start? This is the best TV show I've watched and it will probably stay that way. Dynamic characters, incredible plot that's not predictable or too random. This show just feels real and the writing for the show is phenomenal. There were a few episodes were it lost it's luster but Season 5 regained the extremely minimal doubt I had in the shows shortcomings.

The acting is great and there's always new problems/storylines going on with each season.

Phenomenal, outstanding, intense, binge-worthy are a few adjectives that can describe this downright beautiful series"
10.0,16 October 2013,"My husband and I started watching the BB marathon three weeks ago. We just finished it today. They couldn't have picked a better cast for this show. Brian Cranston puts on a performance of a lifetime. And I couldn't picture anyone else playing the part. Every episode will leave you begging to watch the next one. The sad thing is its over and I'm still wishing there was another season. This is the first review I've ever felt compelled to write. The best thing is the series finale will leave nothing to the imagination.

For the foreseeable future my TV watching will be forever ruined due to the fact that I will compare every show I watch to BB.

RIP Breaking Bad.... and Hiesenberg

Hope we see Jessie and Saul VERY soon!!!

Good Luck to all the cast Thank You Gilligan for creating my mind the

""BEST SHOW EVER""

PS. Even Anthony Hopkins thinks it's the best acting he's EVER seen. And it only took him 2 weeks to watch 5 seasons...."
10.0,12 October 2019,I just needed to say this: Best TV show in TV history until today and probably ever. Thankful to have been alive to watch it as it aired. Words will never make this show justice. A masterpiece.
7.0,12 November 2017,"OK, we all know the synopsis: gifted but henpecked high school chemistry teacher gets lung cancer and decides to cook world class meth, hijinks ensue. But it's much more than that.

The show is written VERY realistically. Because Walt starts out as such a real human being, in every scene, in every episode, right to the end, the viewer finds him or herself asking, ""What would I do in the same situation?"" No other show has managed to do that.

And as the show goes on, one's answers diverge more and more because we're less in Walt's position with every episode. How would a normal person go about making and selling drugs without getting caught? What would we do when our competition came to kill us? Those may be pretty simple. But what would we do when our loved ones found out, and keeping it quiet meant harming them, for whom, we tell ourselves, we have taken all this risk in the first place?

They say there are only seven basic plots, and America's clear favorite is ""overcoming the monster,"" but this is not that kind of story. It's a ""tragedy"" much like the greatest story ever told: The Iliad, and it has elements of a dark comedy in it. Walt is Achilleus. Gus is Hektor. The DEA and APD are the gods, not knowing who to help and where to strike, and not entirely good guys in any case. The intelligent viewer will go from rooting for Walt to hating him just slightly less than his enemies. The less intelligent viewer will go from loving Walt to merely hating his shrewish but sensible wife. But all will enjoy the show. Buckle up for the ride of your life."
1.0,7 August 2020,"I regret not having seen this tv show before. This is one of the greatest master pieces ever created: the screenplay, the acting, the evolution of each character, the cinematography and the finale... everything is just perfectly constructed. I completely loved it. Bravo!"
10.0,3 September 2020,
10.0,7 November 2021,"Overrated and overshadowed by Better Call Saul: too many forced points of 'smart' and 'experienced' characters doing stupid things just for plot purposes without any integrity to the actual story arcs or characters.

It is entertaining and much much less graphic than I had been led to believe. The moments of comedy are my favorite parts and the characters' connections to Better Call Saul are worth exploring if you are a fan of that show."
9.0,10 April 2020,"I honestly don't understand how this show appeales to so many people. It's INSANE to think that this title has 9,5 on imdb. The caracters are sooo boring and rude, i hate them. I hate this show. Period."
10.0,27 August 2013,"The sudden change of a common man. Walter White, placid high school teacher, was taken ill with an incurable disease. Turns out not to have anything to lose by becoming a drug dealer to ensure a bright future for his family.

Breaking Bad is without a doubt the most realistic, vivid, perfectly executed, psychedelic, brilliant, Mind Blowing, Stunning Comedy-Drama Series ever!!! It beats even Twin Peaks and I am a huge D.Lynch fan imagine that! Bryan Cranston is a hell of an actor, he deserves to be crowned in the Hollywood firmament and Vince Gilligan is a visionary genius. Masterpiece."
8.0,26 October 2013,"This is my first review on IMDb and until now I didn't feel like writing one. That is until I saw Breaking Bad.

This is perhaps the best TV show in history. The things that happen in Breaking Bad are unpredictable and amazing. This show also keeps builds up very well and feels very natural and realistic.

I also have a strong connection to the characters in this show. I feel what they experience. This show really touches me and its sometimes very exiting to watch it. That you are on the edge of your seat and can't stop watching the show.

I don't know of any other TV series that matches the same quality as that of Breaking Bad. I think Breaking Bad has reached a quality level that no other TV series will match ever.

Thank you for reading my review. I really recommend the TV series to watch it."

Most iconic Acting Performance from each Charecters Walter White & Jesse PinkMan Oh my Ghod ! I really do not want to call Them with their original names even Strong Story , Best Screenplay , Best Plot till now.Even Each episode has Cracking Dialogues.

9.0,9 June 2020,"Breaking bad is the best show I have ever watched, with an amazing story, the GREATEST acting, especially Walt and Jesse. Many may stop watching this because of the first 5 episodes but PLEASE KEEP WATCHING. I felt the same but the ""long"" intro on Wlat's boring and horrible life is CRUCIAL in order to understand this psychological masterpiece.

10.0,11 July 2011,"Yes this series had potentials. The reason I'm using past tense is because that the damage is unfixable. Unlike to other reviews that you will read i will stick to the essence of what people need to read and that is facts.

To begin with i will start with the pros. Character selection is the major asset of this series. All roles are well played representing exactly the feelings that need to be transferred to the audience. Other than that, what i liked in this series is the photography. Nice original shots that make you partially not to pay attention to the scenarios flaws.

Yes the scenario is leaking from everywhere.

First of all there is lack of focus. When i say lack of focus i mean what is this movie about? Is it a drama which speaks about a family man doing whatever he can to provide? If this is the answer then 4-5 episodes should be enough to present that. However the series is off to the 4th season and i yet to understand why i am watching it. Definitely is not for the suspense or the action. Neither for the cool chemistry involved.

Second, the scenario does not convince me. Although that 70% of the story is brightly written many scenes just do not sum up. What you would expect from a chemistry genius related scenario is at least to justify its actor's actions.

Another con is the long meaningless dialogs. In every episode there are at least 3-4 dialogs that put you to sleep.

Summing up what i would like to see from this series is: 1) Cool chemistry involved 2) More action 3) Less talking

and 4) please some suspense"
10.0,11 November 2020,"The story is really ignoring many real-world things, that's why it works. Walt has several problems with communication, sometimes he could just say anything, while Jesse is simply a useless human being. Cannot like these characters. I have no idea why it has such a high rating. I'm almost at the end of the second season.

I like the chemistry facts. That's why it has more than 4."
10.0,3 November 2013,"I am not into Television series. This was my first attempt and boy, did it blow my mind!

Every single factor about Breaking Bad is so fine and original and startling, I was addicted to it and still am. I could, if time permits, watch all episodes again and again. That is why the 100%, because this show can even make the most boring person find a reason to get smart.

With so much swag, the characters are well-written. Bryan Cranston is simply outstanding. Supporting cast is brilliant and the airs they carry with the portrayals is so charming, it is very hard to believe it is fiction. Aaron Paul's facial expressions, Dean Norris' funny physique and his laugh snorts, Anna Gunn's OMG emotions & her beauty are all simply amazing. RJ Mitte is fantastic.

Now, for the story, it is gold and this one shines, too. Every episode reveals something new about the chemistry involved in cooking crystal-drug, Walter White's familial problems and all that comes along. The little to grave dangerous adventures the two main characters set on towards the end of Season 1 is mind-boggling. And with the high- level of crime involved... I mean all sorts of crimes... the boldness overflows threshold and that is what works here!

The music, the cinematography, the direction & the cast performance together puts up to the startling birth & departure of a very good TV series. ""Better Call Saul"" will be good, eh?

BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! And if you are planning to start a new series to watch, make it Breaking Bad! This is some serious entertainment stuff!

Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO

10.0,16 January 2014,"We are all wondering who we are. The true self. The very big ""I"" definition. So, as a youngster, I am obsessed with the question of finding my own self, which is the thing I constantly look for in every piece of art I ever have the fortune to look at. Songs, paintings, photographs, novels all full of characters trying to figure out who they are. Some of them failed and some of them succeeded, but very few of them, not to my recollection, ever hit me as hard in the feeling as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman did. Their journey, together and separately, totally rip the heart out of me.

Now you may ask: Walter and Jesse who? Dear Breaking Bad non-watchers, you MUST watch it, or else, you have missed the true best masterpiece ever created on TV. I'm not that TV bug who would search for all kinds of shows; by contrast I'm kinda picky. So before watching the show, whenever I heard Breaking Bad internet fanbase chanting ""Breaking Bad Breaking Bad"" I was like ""Stop it now! No show can be that great!"". ""9.6/10 on IMDb huh? How could people be so obsessed with a fictional show? Maybe I should give it a try."" Then I started off following the journey of Breaking Bad. Just so you know, the show is about Walter White, a school Chemistry teacher who was diagnosed with lung cancer and supposed to live for no longer than six months. Devastated by the fact that his family, including a housewife, a disabled son and a baby girl on the way, would not be able to live without money after his death, he found a way to partner up with his ex- student Jesse Pinkman to become meth dealers (meth or crystal meth is a kind of drug). And this is when all good (or bad, or even evil) things start to happen, then constitute 5 spectacular seasons of the whole series. During the whole series, you will follow the two main characters in their process of ""breaking bad"", or I would prefer, revealing who they are. You will find yourself excited inside a steamy meth lab as a true meth cook, then get nervous and anxious anytime the duo meth cooks are about to get caught. There will be times when you definitely enjoy the badass explosion scenes, the gun shooting fights, the ""Yeah bitch!"" moments of the show. But there will also be all those tough hours when you fill your eyes with tears. No, you will not cry out loud. There just the pain you feel very deep from the heart, and tears just unnoticedly stream down on your face. Those moments will just leave you days of emptiness and sorrows.

So be prepared. The drama is a hardcore type with topless strippers, drug use exposure and very violent crime scenes. There will be extremely sad moments (I'm not telling you when, to avoid spoilers. But those moments will stay a while in your heart for certain). It would be hard for you to choose to love, or to hate any character on the show, because Black/White just doesn't exist – all the main characters are morally ambiguous, leading you to a vague land of a gray mixed space of what is right and what is wrong.

Just watch it. And enjoy the pain"
10.0,30 September 2013,"Easily one of the best written shows in television history to date. I was engrossed in it from the start, through every single episode and it never lapsed in the drama or cheated its characters or the story. Stunning and gritty and wholly excellent. The devil is in the details, nothing wasted, everything meaningful down to the camera angles and foreshadowing.

This show was so tight from music to the costumes... and the acting, OH THE ACTING!!! I wasn't sure they could bring it to the end without dropping the ball, but they did it, keeping everyone guessing and never disappointing. I can't find fault with it. Incredibly epic series; the writers are to be congratulated and celebrated for this masterpiece.

Just watch the first episode, and if you like it at all, settle in for the ride and hang on. That is all. They've set the bar for drama unbelievably high with this one. Amazing."
10.0,3 February 2014,"I don't know what to say about this show.... there are not enough words in the English language to describe the amazing-ness of this television series! I didn't ever watch this show when it was on the air...because I didn't wanna buy into all the hype..... i was stuck on my usual shows like ""Entourage""...""boardwalk empire""...""homeland""...etc.. and not taking anything away from those shows...i LOVE those series also....but something about Breaking Bad is just... different. This show hits a nerve.... it is entertainment from minute 1 to 60....the writers of the show are nothing short of genius! I'm currently not even finished season 4 yet..but I have been watching them all back to back since season 1....and it is literally the only thing i want to watch. Addiction to the show is an understatement. I'm telling you right now...if you have gone this long without seeing this show... do yourself a favor and buy season 1.... make sure u watch AT LEAST 3 episodes in a row.. (that's the usual number that I find it takes to get into a new show)...and I guarantee you...YOUR HOOKED! Like the meth in the show....the show is the addiction!

WATCCHHH ITTT!!!!"
10.0,16 September 2012,"I started watching the show with my wife, we almost finished season 1 in couple of days. I can't wait to go get the rest of all the other seasons. Bryan Cranston's (the main character) acting is Oscar material. I wonder why I haven't known about his previous works! I guess I am going to research him and get some of his old stuff. Aaron Paul (Jesse) was the perfect pick for this role, my wife and I fell in love with his character more and more after each episode. RJ Mitte (Walter Jr.) in my opinion is a super star. The kind of kid that you'd love to adopt. He's full full of love and compassion to his family. I do watch a lot of TV!!! And frankly this is the only one that I have enjoyed as much as the Sopranos! Buy it or rent it, I highly recommend it."
7.0,13 October 2019,"This series set in the years 2008-2009 is a must, I cannot recommend it enough. With an apparently not very appealing central plot (without spoiler), a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque diagnosed with stage-3 lung cancer who takes the decision to produce and sell drugs with a former student, the series grabs you in a witty plot full of suspense, black humor and violence during which the main character, Walter White played by Bryan Cranston, evolves while the spectator's feelings towards him do so as well.

Once you finish watching it, it does not leave you indifferent, at the same time some unanswered question make you think about, why not, a spin-off or a potential continuation of the series in the future."
1.0,8 August 2020,"OK, so Breaking Bad is not a show I would normally watch, because it's very dark, has some language I don't like, and has plenty of (at times, very shocking!) violence. But in February of this year (2020) AMC was showing it on Sundays, and the first episode sucked me right in. Y'all this show really is the best ever!. I had heard about it, but I knew it was violent, and normally I'm very sensitive to that. But I digress. It's truly the most amazing show I've ever seen, and it's ruined regular TV for me. Amazing plot twists, some dark humor which I love, incredible cinematography, great cast, a good soundtrack, etc. Everyone on the show is awesome, of course, but Cranston is incredible. Sorry, I'm jumping all over the place, but if you're reading reviews for it you know you wanna watch it. I've only watched the entire series three times since February ( and hope to watch again soon) , so I kinda like it :)"
8.0,31 March 2016,"As someone who has been watching TV for a long time I can safely say that Breaking Bad is the greatest of them all.

Every aspect of the show is phenomenal.

The acting, of course, is top notch. The writing is brilliant and never predictable.

The cinematography is gorgeous. I have driven through Albuquerque and it is certainly not as memorable as the makes it out to be. That is a compliment to show, not a knock on the city itself.

Another important thing the show-runners did to make Breaking Bad stand out is to know when to end it. Lesser shows extend themselves beyond the point where the quality can't be maintained. Breaking Bad is a rare gem that will remembered and studied for years."
10.0,24 August 2011,
9.0,1 October 2021,Overall the show is great but there are some major issues with characters especially Hank's son and wife. It's amazing that they turn on him especially his wife and its ultimately what ruins him.
10.0,24 February 2008,
10.0,13 April 2012,"Very rarely do you see a piece of television that stretch beyond the context of the nature of the shows premise to a level whereby viewers genuinely care for the characters. Even rarer than this, is to have a series that depict the dark seedy underbelly of our drug ridden society leaving the viewer compassionate for the producer of such an illicit substance and hoping in all regards to have the drug cook find ultimate wellbeing and a happy ending.

This show demonstrates pure and ismple why AMC has set themselves apart from every other television channel in terms of the quality of the programming they provide. The stations motto is ""Where Story Matters"" and it is no more evident than within Breaking Bad.

Walter White, is the series primary protagonist, a highly capable yet sadly under achieving Nobel potential scientist who now teaches at a high school. The story begins with Walter being diagnosed with cancer, a seemingly apparent death sentence leaving him with relatively little future potential and the problematic series of events that result as he attempts to provide support for his family well after his death. The audience gains an immediate connection for the series main character, feeling empathetic as he hears his diagnosis and reluctant yet convinced as he investigates the option of manufacturing methampethamine to build the nest egg he believes will support his family after his death.

This is not a series about drug, this is not a show about shard/ice/whatever you want to call it. It is simply the context for which this amazing story plays through. The story is more about the emotional development of the characters as the seemingly 'Mr Good' enters the seedy underbelly of society, and the fact that he is seemingly willing to go to any lengths to leave his family in a positive state. As the series progresses, the draw of the underworld is a constant theme for Walter as despite the developments it continues on its path of pure immersion and compassion from the viewer.

You will not feel compassion for every character that presents themselves, however, every character you meet has a crucial role in the development of character and story. This series is a true rarity amongst Television, the story is immaculate. You notice not only the main character, but his younger former student counterpart grow and develop as the situation develops.

Having been a chronic user of drugs in the past, this story relates to me as a user, and as a theatrical buff. Whether your watching it because of its mention of the world of illicit substances or you simply enjoy an impeccably written and engrossing story Breaking Bad is one of the series that you cannot miss. If you have'nt seen it, watch it, every episode; then try to disagree if you must. But this show is one of the single greatest pieces of modern television you will ever see; and watching it leaves you feeling as if you've learnt something about the human psyche. Breaking Bad, is the single greatest television show i have ever watched, do not miss the chance to enjoy this masterpiece."

10.0,16 May 2021,Do you want to see perfection.here it is.the best show I have seen in my life.
10.0,7 January 2016,"I cannot give this show enough praise. I have seen a lot of TV shows including the Sopranos, Game Of Thrones, The Wire, Mad Men etc and none of them compare to Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art. Intelligently written and amazingly well acted. Even two years after Breaking Bad ended, it is still hands down the best show I've ever seen in my life and I don't think anything will surpass in my lifetime. Every time I rewatch this phenomenal series I always discover something new and pick up on things that I missed before. Each season only gets better and better. The characters are also amazing and complex. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the two standouts as they give the best performances that I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing on television. The on screen chemistry between these two actors is unreal. The Walt and Jesse relationship is the heart and soul of Breaking Bad.Anna Gunn,Dean Norris, Johnathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk,Betsy Brant and RJ Mitte are also incredible on this show. Vince Gilligan your a genius. Thank you for giving us this outstanding work of art that will surely stand the test of time. Another thanks to all the outstanding cast and writers and directors for the success of this show. Trust me when I say that Breaking Bad really deserves all the hype it gets. I would give it more than a 10/10 if I could because this show deserves that and so much more. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet then WATCH IT NOW!!!!! You won't be disappointed."
7.0,1 January 2010,"Seasons 1 and 2 have recently been shown on UK digital TV on the ""Five USA"" channel. They've packed the whole lot into about ten weeks, and I have been gripped since the first seconds.

I've never seen anything like this, and I've never seen any series cram so much ""story"" into each episode. The characters, for the most part, are completely believable - you've met them all yourselves. Their actions are completely consistent with their characters. If you can accept Walter's initial decision to build up a cash nest-egg for the family he is expecting to leave destitute, then everything that happens seems to follow inevitably. There's no way back, you're at the bottom of a hole you've dug for yourself, and all the alternatives to ""keep digging"" will have even more horrendous consequences.

I didn't think I'd see anything better than ""The Wire"", but if this one can maintain it's standard through season 3 and onwards, it may well run it close. ""Breaking Bad"" is up there with ""The Sopranos"" and ""Dexter"" as outstanding entertainment. This is very black humour, interlaced with the tragedy of both strong and ineffective personalities being forced to take actions they know are wrong and really don't want to do. Every decision, however logical it may seem, leads to a situation where yet another unpalatable decision has to be made.

It's a bit like real life."
1.0,2 June 2019,"If you asked me prior to April 2019 to pit the two most critically acclaimed TV series against each other - as fair or unfair as it is based on the fact that they are two completely different shows, but if you boiled it down to the basics I would've told you that Game of Thrones was ever-so-slightly better than Breaking Bad...the former has some complexities and ""holy *four letter word*"" moments that are just unmatched by anything I've ever watched. And I may be one of the few that did not mind the last season of GoT and it's resolution, but also agree with the masses in the decline in quality and nuance (what both shows are notorious for) of GoT's last season, couple with a fair amount of wasted potential and forgone character development in the last season. I think we all are guilty of coming up with our own intermediate/extended scenes in our minds to satisfy or complement what we saw on the actual TV screen.

Thus, now that both shows are done the real winner is very apparent: Breaking Bad emerges victorious from the battle.

From start to finish, BB is as close to perfection as any piece of media can get. Everyone knows the story, but I will never forget how absolutely intense, stunning, and at times anxiety-inducing the experience of watching this show was (I binged it very shortly after the finale since everyone was absolutely freaking out about how good it was). It balances every character and everything good about the crime/drama genre coupled with an amazingly unique premise that almost demands tension at any given moment.

Acting...directing...cinematography...editing... and above all, writing...all literally 100% on point, all the time. Including the resolution/finale. No wishing for something different or character arc ambiguity. It was sensical, shocking, and satisfactory to the highest degree.

Both GoT and BB have raised the bar for TV that was already elevated by shows like The Sopranos and The Wire. Some current ones are close (check out Barry for some awesome and unique black comedy, and clearly takes some cues from BB) but will be hard pressed to find something as magical as Breaking Bad - the closest we will get is its counterpart show Better Call Saul, which is also damn near perfect (come or with Season 5 already, dammit!)

Go Team Gilligan - I am waiting for your next project!"

10.0,24 April 2012,"I cant state enough how awesome the director and script is in this show. Its like Dexter with good artists and script. Pace is slow, but you are actually never bored. The show has no clichés, weird untrustworthy characters or poor acting. A MUST watch, give it at least two episodes before making up your mind.

Show never goes stale, you sympathize with almost all the characters have motives you can relate to, even if they want something completely different. The plot never gets out of line or far fetched, and episodes never ends in huge obnoxious cliffhangers. A fine mixture of crime, chemistry and soap all in one.

Good luck watching, remember to support the producer if you like it :)"
10.0,11 January 2015,"Late into season 4 I got a chance to be cast as an extra. I had to admit that I was really excited but really had never seen a whole episode. Before you hate me understand I just hadn't found the time to watch. I got asked to be involved and the first day I could tell how huge this was. I then found a way to watch condensed episodes and watched all the previous seasons marathon style. So now fully prepared for the magnitude of this great show and all that surrounds it. I found myself just as ""Geeked out"" as my fellow extras because we were fans and could saw things and places that are now famous for our city and people that would become icons of this wonderful adventure. Thank you Vince for trusting in me, and the rest for helping make it a wonderful show."
10.0,20 July 2022,"One sided story. First some seasons means something. It got suspence and tension which makes it worth watching. But it's too long for so little story where only the main character is it's focous point.

If conversation is the only thing u ever want to acknowledge it's the best show but if u like to think while watching and recall what i just watched u will know; there is vision for question just the length and consumption of ur time.

Talk talk and just talk where they should have put some actual event and expand it's focous point.

So this show Don't deserve to be in the top of imdb top list cause it's not the best story/show u will ever find or watch."
10.0,4 April 2022,"Ive been hearing about this show for years, and finally started watching it. The word masterpiece was thrown around a lot when people were telling me about it. As someone who loves great plots, Im quite disappointed. None of the characters are likable, NONE, apart from Walt Junior. They really overdid it though with the two bald mexican guys in the same silver suits for days on end - never said a word and acted like Arnold in The Terminator. Hilarious. Im on season 3 now, I dont know how long Ill watch this, cuz as I said, and especially the protagonists arent likable. No qualities at all. Tommy from Peaky Blinders was a violent ruthless murderer, but at least the viewers liked him. Why did people like these two I have yet to find out..."

10.0,30 September 2013,"This review doesn't contain any spoilers, because I wouldn't forgive myself if I ruined this show for anyone!

First of all I want to thank the cast, crew and Vince Gilligan for the best 47 hours of television of my whole life. I am flabbergasted about the fact that it really pulled me in from the beginning to the end and it will never let me go entirely. The characters are so well played and the script is so ingenious. I have no words for how great this show is. This was a perfect ending for a perfect show. This show really is about transformation, misery and happiness. It really, really got me, I am just too full of it now, but I felt like writing a review. So if you haven't watched this show and your looking for something good: this is more than a recommendation! For everyone who has watched breaking bad, I wish you all the best of luck on getting your life on track now that this show is over. Frankly, it will be very hard for me.

Thank you breaking bad!"
10.0,7 June 2010,"For over a year, I had a chance to watch this show on Comcast ON DEMAND. I watched the first episode of season two a couple of times, but never got past the first five or so minutes.

Out of boredom, I finally got past the first few minutes and to be honest, I was blown away! The acting is first rate and the plot has more twists and turns that a roller coaster at Six Flags.

I bought all of season on on Itunes to complete my knowledge of the show and then season 3 started.

Last night I just watched the next to last season 3 episode. After a few shows that seemed the season was just dragging to a close, the final 10 seconds had me jumping to my feet screaming ""Oh my God!"".

Now I can't wait for the season finale to come, and yet I will hate for the season to finish and wait another 8 or so months for season 4 to start.

All in all, one of the best dramas I have ever seen. I know this show can't last forever, but it ranks right up there with the best of these cable TV series that last 10 to 13 episodes. Funny, serious, outrageous, sometimes stupid....but hey, its a fantasy right."
7.0,31 July 2014,
1.0,9 May 2016,"It is a wonder, and a great mistake on my behalf, that I only got around to watch ""Breaking Bad"" now in 2016, because I have really been missing out on something phenomenal. What initially made me stay away from the series back when it was airing was the premise of a cancer-struck teacher making methamphetamine. I mean, how much fun could a TV series about such a thing be? But I was put to shame, multiple times over, because ""Breaking Bad"" is nothing short of extraordinarily spectacular.

The series starts out in a very high gear and never really slows down. Which is a very impressive feat, because it is quite a thing to keep it going at such a high and fast pace for 6 seasons without losing momentum.

What makes ""Breaking Bad"" so phenomenally good is the combination of a thrilling storyline, interesting and well-fleshed-out characters and a myriad of talents actors and actresses to portray these characters. The storyline and the characters come off as being believable and realistic and that is one of the aspects that really appealed to me. And also that Bryan Cranston was superbly cast for the role of Walter White.

I sat through all episodes in all of the six seasons in a very short time, and it seemed like I had just started when I reached the very last episode. A testimony to how compelling and captivating the storyline really was.

""Breaking Bad"" combines seriousness and light comedy in a good manner, which does work quite well.

The only downside to the series is that it does suffer from predictability. You know what will happen to Walter White and Jesse Pinkman ahead of time, as they are the two main characters. But it is not really a factor that drags down the overall enjoyment of the series in any way. Especially because the director managed to build up the scenes throughout the series in a manner that you really want to see what happens, despite of you already knowing it.

Well, there are actually two downsides to the series, come to think of it, and the other being that it is unlikely that you will sit down to watch it a second time, as the series doesn't seem to have that much repeated watching value.

If you, like me, have missed out on this TV series, then you really should do yourself a favor and sit down to watch it, because it is really a blast of a TV show."

""This is must see TV"" that's all you need to see it as fast as you have a chance since the season 4 is coming now. Past three seasons had created a die hard fans base over the world. From the acting, the direction to the unique style combining from the classic gangster dramas in history of motion pictures such as The Godfather, Scar Face, Pulp Fiction, No country for old men, Fargo etc...... Breaking bad shows us the new golden generation of cable TV drama by the brilliant creator Vince Gilligan and multi Emmy winner Bryan Cranston

The plot is simple. An underachieved middle class chemistry teacher name Walter White, lives in a small town of a common state in US. Who also has incurable cancer and a family which he can't afford.

Then.....he decided to break bad

Within the desperation and honorific, Walt and his ex student Jesse Pinkman took us to a hilarious journey but no short of thrill and suspension name ""How to transform from loser to a Godfather!! For dummy!!""

AMC really makes it' slogan: ""Future American classic TV drama"""
10.0,7 October 2020,"If you ever want to see another show again. Its getting lame to watch any other kind of television drama again which is not as good as BB. And I haven't Seen anything close to it. This show feels so real, i have never seen better acting in my life.

Even the rewatching is incredible. It never gets boring, watched it like 10 times. I still don't believe it."

10.0,12 February 2015,"My first review on IMDb (I think). I want to congratulate the entire cast, crew, writers, producers, etc.. on this monumental achievement. Binge-watched the entire series in 2 weeks. Remarkable casting. Superb writing. Even the film stock has subtle qualities not seen in regular TV shoots (I understand BB was filmed in 35mm film). Rarely predictable, layered and nuanced in ways TV rarely is, and emotionally gripping. It's had me thinking about it for days afterward, like a really excellent novel. I didn't realize Walt was the zany dad on Malcom in the Middle until the 3rd season. Never knew he could really ACT in a deeply dramatic role.

Do yourself a favor and watch this artistic masterpiece of dramatic theater."

10.0,21 October 2012,"Thanks to netflix and vudu, I've just spent the last three weeks getting up to speed on all currently available mind-blowing episodes of what has to be the most lethally addictive, stunningly compelling, brilliantly written and performed non-major-network television series in the history of the medium.

With Breaking Bad, Vince Gilligan and Co. demonstrate what television actually can be; to say it's ground-breaking entertainment is a deplorable understatement. Each and every episode of the fifty four that have been released thus far - with the last eight to start filming next month and set to air in the summer of 2013 - have left me wanting more, craving more, like an addict. One night I watched six at one time, should've been heading to bed after the third but instead I found myself hitting 'play next episode' until I'd finished the last one of that season.

It's all been said already, of course - the staggeringly genius performance of Cranston as Walter White and his slow, magnificently staged transformation into Heisenberg (at this point I call him WaltHeisen), the also magnificent performances from everyone else in the cast, the sheer dazzlingness of the writing, the direction, the photography. . .Everything about the show is perfection incarnate. I especially love how they don't start the episodes off with 'Previously on Breaking Bad. . .' but rather they use the far more effective method of an opening scene, followed by the Breaking Bad music and title sequence.

Sometimes the scene (particularly in the earlier episodes, from season one) picks up right where the last one left off but most often, it's a teaser scene, which ties in with something later in the episode or in a different one altogether, like with season five starting off with WaltHeisen 'celebrating' his fifty second birthday in the diner, but eight episodes later, in the half-season cliff-hanger (with the cleverly-titled Walt Whitman poetry line Gliding Over All), WaltHeisen is still fifty one. The ultimate teaser, morbid shades of things to come. Absolutely cannot freakin' wait - another deplorable understatement."
10.0,7 May 2015,"Oh yeah...thats true ...I was never an addict before watching this but this TV series made me an addict ...of a TV serial :) For the first time in life i found myself compulsively addicted to watch a season continuously. I just could not get it off my head, could not resist watching it ..found drawn , pulled or sucked by Breaking Bad into itself n I was not able help myself , totally out of my own control. I had seen entire 5 (or 6 ?) seasons of Breaking Bad ; all 62 episodes in over weekend . I started watching Friday night as a friends suggested me this series, ; but I told him ""well I am not a big fan of TV series but am more of a movies guy"" ; But when it started it turned out to be one big hell of a movie ...60 hours long !!just started as timepass I started with First episode to get a sleep but this literally took away all the sleep And all this time i watching it continuously obsessively without moving , without bath , just eating chips n junk food all the while . And by the time I finished it and woke up next morning ...I didn't even knew what day it was? Is it Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday? This may seem an extreme reaction to Breaking Bad but i guess it was worthy of what this is ..Truly Awesome !!! I guess i was behaving like a junkie ...lingering in my couch ...shabby , unclean ...just watching it and feeling myself a part of parallel universe where Breaking Bad isn't a TV series and I am not a viewer but a part of it ...or where I am the who knocks :) Its a trip down your innermost fears , desires , ambitions , conflicts and confusion in all of it.

I had always been fan of Stanely Kubrick like ""Grey Matter"" movies which are both nerdy and also shows humans not in brackets of good vs evil but in a more nuanced thousand shades of grey . This movie is all about transformation of a human from white into grey to dark grey to black ; slowly methodically just like chemistry and once done you cant even determine who is black or who is white . Its all then becomes a single compound of humans ...Greedy n selfish ,filled with frustration, anger ,confusion and more subtle desire to be respected , to feel important , to feel love and to care for the family. All of them when mixed with right ingredients of cancer hopelessness gives a high of power from where there is no point of return. Once you get it there are no more moral or ethical boundaries left. No judgements to be made. Its all dark but sadly its closest to real world we live in.

If Kubrick has ever made a TV series i bet that would be something like Breaking Bad. Its epitome of what TV series can do and raises a bar for other great series like BBC's Sherlock. It mixes human emotions in a cocktail so never seen before. It metamorphosis a human from white into black with erosion of its soul and rusting of its moral compass. Its all that who all wish to be on the inside. Its a chemical formula to give us a high into our deepest desires ...just like meth :) I was little disappointed by end though, felt very typical Hollywood style and little out of touch. A darker end where either Jesse & Walt dies in captivity or oblivion would have more satisfying .

Nevertheless this is a TV series which gives a better high than snorting meth :)"

10.0,22 January 2024,"There are huge chunks of this show dedicated to the character skyler, who truly annoys and makes my skin crawl. I mean the annoyance is at its highest. Who gives a squat what this person does or doesn't do. Huge chunks of every episode is about her. Honestly it's pathetic. The rest of the characters are not bad, no pun intended. The story is not bad. My favorite character is Saul Goodman, attorney at law and what a funny, charismatic person he is in the show. Skylers sister so annoying. How did this show get such a high rating is what am asking? It's not perfect nor that captivating. Yes I've seen it and I've seen everything out there. It has some cool scenes no doubt that doesn't make up for the annoyance."
10.0,4 August 2018,"Can't believe how much hype there is around this show it's unbelievable!! And let me tell you that i gave it a really good chance! At this moment I'm on the second episode of the last season, but i just CAN NOT CONTINUE. This show is so so SO boring. There's like 2-3 times when something interesting actually happened, but I'm serious it is the most overrated series that i came across- skip this one!"

1.0,13 February 2021,"For the longest time I've heard how Breaking Bad is one of, if not, the best TV show to ever exist. After finally seeing it for the first time, I can agree.

Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a chemistry teacher who get diagnosed with cancer and decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine in order to provide for his family.

I know I'm extremely late to this series but I finally got the chance to watch it and binged through it in about ten days because of how much I loved it. It's very rare for a TV show to completely hook you throughout but Breaking Bad is one of the few shows that manages to do it. To make over fifty hours of entertaining television is a very difficult task but what Vince Gilligan and his team of writers were able to do is truly astounding. I don't think there is a single weak episode in this series as Gilligan and his team try to make the most out of each one whether it's to develop characters or raise the stakes, there is always something that kept me engaged and wanting to watch the next episode. Seasons 4 and 5 were my favourite as that's when it really got intense and ended in a manner that made sense and felt satisfying. Seasons 1 and 3 were also fantastic as they built and set up the characters and intensity for the next two seasons. Season 2 is the weakest in my opinion as it sets up something interesting for the season finale but after finding out what it was, I did feel slightly underwhelmed. Apart from this one issue, the rest of the show is pretty much perfect.

The writing is consistently fantastic. There are some very funny moments but that doesn't take away from the overall serious tone of the show. The world of Breaking Bad is so grounded and its realistic nature made all the events and situations feel believable to me. The writing is solid but it's also the acting that really elevates the material. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen an actor give. It's mindblowing to see how his character transforms by the end and he brings so much to that transformation. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is another standout. Again, an actor that brought so many memorable moments in the show and conveyed every emotion necessary to the best of his ability. Anna Gunn is spectacular as Skyler. There are various emotional scenes where she truly excelled in. Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman makes for the show's funniest moments. Dean Norris as Hank Schrader is very likeable and fun to watch. The rest of the cast also bring their A game to this insanely good show.

Breaking Bad is one of my favourite shows of all time. It's a story that's simple but Vince Gilligan and his team add so many layers to it that make the final product unforgettable and a staggering feat. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, definitely give it a watch as I believe it's a show that's worth your time."
10.0,2 August 2020,It's actually amazing how this show is great all the time..no matter how many times you watch it....I've seen it 3 times now..Greatest television ever made! 🙌🏾🙌🏾
10.0,6 September 2015,
10.0,2 September 2016,"The writers and producers of Breaking Bad cooked something new up. They turned on the stove, put on a big pot and mixed in an array of ingredients. They simmered some spices and flavors while frying up some chicken.

The end result was some forty six hours of pure entertainment. But this wasn't your ordinary show. Nothing conventional you would expect took place from years of conditioning from other shows. It never took the easy way out just to wrap up a story line. Breaking Bad took you into the dark corners and recesses of the human psyche, all while ensuring it also drummed up plenty of laughs to let you know not to take it so seriously.

What was it going for? Was this just some mindless action? Some intelligent thriller? An entertaining dark comedy? A drama? At times it was all of these things, but what Breaking Bad actually is is a morality tale. While producing entertaining storytelling styles competently throughout the series, it ultimately is a cautionary tale about the disintegration of the human soul. It explores why an intelligent person can turn to the dark side and realistically details exactly how that can occur.

Such plotting and centralized character studying and development goes far beyond Chemistry. It moves into quantum physics, philosophy, and metaphysics. Brilliantly, as Breaking Bad carves out its own universe in a detailed degree that the criminal world of Albuquerque, New Mexico becomes a character of its own, it begs the question of what world, or universe, the main character Walter White has decided to embark down, or live in. In the theory of parallel or multiple universes (multiverse), this decision for the antihero to choose to alter his course into a different world sets the stage for the disintegration of his soul. Every step he takes and decision he makes in his chosen universe contrasts the old universe he could have chosen to live in. Metaphorically, on an elementary level, one can say that he chose to live in hell. As the saying goes, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"".

Thus, while Breaking Bad is window-dressed with crystal meth, it is actually an exploratory journey of the human soul, and how each decision one makes can not only hurt themselves but also impact everyone around them. Breaking Bad has no fear in applying this cosmic-karmic revelation. Through subtleties and non-subtleties, each action triggers an equal or opposite ""reaction""; nothing the Law of Thermodynamics would n't tell you anyway, but to see it occur and applied in real life moralistic ways can have a more profound effect on understanding how it relays real life to the world of physics.

If not definitively taking sides on any particular school of philosophy or politics (another very fine quality of Breaking Bad is its obvious ambiguity throughout, allowing each viewer to identify with it in their own way, or perhaps keeping them open minded to possible alternatives), it certainly puts many of them up to the test. In this random, pointless world where so much is up to a matter of chance versus one's ""free will"", there is a nihilistic sense to Walter's life, but then again through ""free will"", it is clear that Walter's decisions set in motion (Inertia) events that would have been preventable and were not random but instead actual effects of his cause. Similarly, small moments about the legality of drugs and how the law changes in time create political fodder that even goes into Libertarianism. The point is that Breaking Bad has much to say under the meticulous, carefully intertwined and intricate epic crime drama saga.

These layers upon layers combined with its artistic, superficial attention to detail consume the viewer to create an experience seldom matched. Like the meth its protagonist cooked up, the creators of Breaking Bad cooked up something so unique, detailed and interesting that it became an addiction, and the greatest television drama of all time."

10.0,29 September 2013,"Lots of bad acting (Bryan Cranston is a MUCH better comedic actor than he is a dramatic actor, and the wife just flat stinks), replete with preposterous plot twists and character evolutions ... I didn't buy into this turkey for a second, try as I might (and I tried!). And this show proudly sports the two most heinous ""protagonists"" in the history of long form drama. I love Tony Soprano! I love Dexter! Walter White and his scummy little sidekick are relentlessly abhorrent from episode 1. I watched the whole thing, god help me. Thanks for NOTHING, zeitgeist! How something this unpleasant and not-well-done could be so popular is... well I guess it's not really that uncommon, is it? But it never ceases to amaze me. (Saul was great, though!)"
10.0,23 July 2015,"It is fascinating to read all these reviews of Breaking Bad from people who wondered if it would manage to maintain the same level of quality throughout the 2nd and 3rd season.

Having talked with many other Breaking Bad fanatics about the subject, I have yet to find a ""binge watcher"" who saw the last episode of Season 3 (Full Measure) and did not immediately purchase and watch Season 4, Episode 1 (Box Cutter) no matter how much money they had, and no matter what time they had to be at work the next day.

The ending of the show (after five seasons) is absolutely perfect (with background music by Badfinger ""Baby Blue).

The best episode of the show in my opinion is Season 3, Episode 7 (One Minute).

I don't think I have ever seen anything that hit me so hard, with the hard, jerking camera pan into the distance and the insistent car alarm during the ultra violent climax. Absolutely brilliant!

Not to detract from ""Full Measure"" which undoubtedly caused many people to have a very bad day at work the next day.

BTW, Jonathan Banks (Mike), given his brilliant acting in this series, is perhaps the most underrated actor in either TV or film at the moment.

And that is a real Philadelphia accent. I was born there!"
7.0,23 March 2009,
1.0,12 April 2010,"Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher who seems trapped in his own life. He works part-time at a car wash and worries about money. His wife is pregnant and his son has cerebral palsy. In the midst of all this he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.

Seeing as he hasn't amounted to much in life Walter wants to leave something behind. He's looking for easy cash. By chance he meets up with a former student. The student is now a drug dealer, real name Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), who goes by the street name ""Captain Cook"". Walter, who was once a genius chemist, produces some of the best methamphetamine Jesse have ever tried and he starts to push it.

Walter, who already had to deal with his cancer, now also has to deal with his new life as a criminal and a world that might be too much for him to handle. He's also struggling to avoid to catch the suspicion of his brother-in-law Hank who is a D.E.A agent.

Personally, I love the set-up, and the theme. Drug romanticizing and criminal shows always have some moral ambiguity and as such, with very little spoiling, Walter is forced to do bad things. It's intriguing to see a show that doesn't push these things to the edge nor does it ignore them blatantly. Walter displays a gradual and small change. Not overwhelming development from scene to scene as in other TV shows. He also reacts and show disgust for gruesome acts of violence instead of the regular indifference or even reveling in it as we're so used to see in other shows. But it still affects him. And that is another thing I like about this show. Walter has a conscience. But each of his morally ambiguous choices push him closer and closer to the edge. Which raises another point of interest in the show: Will his family tolerate the person he's becoming and will they stick around?

Bryan Cranston has created a very living character with his portrayal of Walter White. Not putting down everyone else's performance for that matter. Even the more apparently superficial characters such as Jesse and Hank have a lot of subtle nuances to them. It's a refreshing contrast to the otherwise exaggerated and stereotypical Hollywood characters who can be summarized in two or three words.

As far as inspirational sources goes the theme of a making the character a bad guy is recognizable from Dexter or The Shield. Breaking Bad however is not as fast-paced as the later (although seasons 2 does crank up the speed) and not as vivid as the former. Not saying that it's not inspirational but Breaking Bad, so far, seems to reward the patient. If this had been CSI: Miami they would probably have told this story in one episode but lacking the great photography, excellent acting and hilarious black comedy.

If you're looking for a show that will grow on you and with refreshing ideas and character development, look no further, Breaking Bad is here."

10.0,22 September 2012,"Cannot believe there are people on this review board giving BB 9 or 8 stars!! There is nothing in all my 36 years on earth that has ever compared to this show. It will go down in history as the best thing to ever hit the small or big screen. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are two of the greatest actors on TV. Every actor on this show is top quality. Every character is relevant to the story and each character develops as the show continues. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, the writers/producers throw in just a touch of comedy to break up the intensity, in the form of Saul Goodman. Pure brilliance. There is absolutely nothing that can be added or taken away to improve this show, as perfection cannot be improved on. After a few great TV series in the nineties, I had almost lost interest in TV dramas (and comedies) since then, then BB came along - this show is completely on another level, it's the Holy Grail of TV. My only criticism is that's all down hill from here - nothing will better or even equal this in our lifetime, nothing."

Breaking Bad has been held as the best thing to ever be put on television, but is it. My answer is it certainly is up there, action, acting and particularly characters. First the acting, Bryan Cranston's Walter White is comparable to Daniel Day-Lewis' Christy Brown, Heath Ledger's Joker, Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump as well as other acting greats. Facial expression is enough let alone the intense delivery of his lines. Newcomer Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse Pinkman, the junkie/independent meth cook, early on you may not be convinced that Paul can act, but give him a chance as well as the show can take a few episodes as this show is the character study of Walter White and how in different ways he went from top to bottom and bottom top at the same time, Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Jesse Plemons and Giancarlo Esposito are particularly brilliant supporting characters (notably Esposito's haunting Gus Fring). The writing on this show is ON. Always ties in earlier episodes and even seasons, never neglects characters (Badger and Skinny Pete). The show's directing is certainly film standard with top directors like Rian Johnson coming in for an episode or two (Season 3's ""Fly"" was excellently shot and one of my favourite directing talents in TV). Each season has its particular qualities, Season 1's comedy, 2's sudden drama, 3's action, 4's intensity and 5's intensity/comedy/action/drama. Season 5 was the strongest season by far as each of the 16 episodes were television art. Character development and wondering whether you love or hate Walter White are the show's biggest strengths, on top of the exquisite writing, Breaking Bad is one of the greats"
10.0,26 January 2022,Breaking bad is simply the best tv show in the world and most would agree on that for several reasons. There are thousands of small details that are almost unseenable in the entire series but all put with so much effort. The characters are all unique in their own way. So yeah thats about it.
10.0,2 September 2011,"The message that the average Joe, when he's forced to make decisions, should just take the low road is Bad. You need money, your job sucks, your life is out of control - you've got two choices: stay where you are or deal meth. You can also pimp yourself middle America or you can deal weed. You can do all these things and feel redemption somehow. This isn't how real life works and it's Bad. Will Hollywood write the script about the guy who rises above it all by becoming a legitimate entrepreneur? Doubtful. For now, they'll stick with the detective who kills or the teacher who pimps, all to convince you this is all there is and that it's Good. No really, it's all Bad."
10.0,29 August 2023,"The acting was top nautch, but the plot seemed to be 1-dimensional and scenes tend to drag along with mundane, pointless prolonged conversations. Overall the pace of the series was quite slow. Bryan Crankston and Anna Gunn's chemistry was excellent. You feel the pain when their marriage goes through the wringer. You also appreciate the closeness of the family. In fact, you get attached to all the characters as they gradually grow on you over the seasons. Though good hearted Aaron tend to get irritating at times with his knee jerk reaction and a being constant screwup. A 7* review accurately describes this series."
10.0,28 February 2019,I don't believe the show should get a one star. I feel 8 would be fair. The only reason I gave it a one star is to help bring down the 9.5 rating. Because it definitely doesn't deserve that record breaking rating. I have seen the show twice and the first time I really enjoyed it. Some character were aggravating but I liked the story and the direction as well. But after a second watch made me fully understand why people like it but not understand the impressive rating. The characters are weak. Very weak delevopment overall
7.0,29 July 2020,The last season of GOT and Prison break shows us why breaking bad is the best!!!
1.0,1 October 2020,"By around 2008, two things had occurred: Hollywood had run out of any original ideas (see the 1990's movies) and crystal meth had popularly become a known drug for many people, replacing cocaine and other preferences. Most people did not get into it, but everyone had heard stories about common suburban professionals who were hooked on meth.

But Breaking Bad was far from a simplistic take on the subject matter, and it never lowered its ambitions in telling its story. Instead, it went well beyond what it needed to do in order to delve into the subject matter. It dissected the life of a middle aged underachieving man, who despite his brilliance and resume, was stuck in suburban life- a victim of a horrible economy and cutthroat corporate business ambitions, mixed with his own naivety on the subject (after all not all chemistry geniuses especially those not born into wealth totally understand the business world while in graduate school).

Breaking Bad nails the catalysts and nuances of how someone can turn from a law abiding citizen into a mastermind criminal just by a simple flick of the switch (which in this case is the soul). Any intelligent person knows what they are capable of doing, however immoral or illegal, but it is only their soul that is keeping them in tact from crossing the line into criminality, especially in a situation where they have been wronged or ripped off by other immoral or criminal people. For we know, nothing in life is guaranteed and hardship for most people is just around the corner in one form or another. This is where Breaking Bad excels; it dissects the morality of society in a realistic way where the viewer sees that everyone is guilty in one way or another and is at some moral or criminal culpability, whilst the antihero, supposedly portrayed as the bad guy is a victim of their selfishness, greed, ignorance, and snobbery.

Hence, Breaking Bad paints a picture that may hit too close to home for the untruthful. In almost every character, the viewer sees a piece of either themselves or someone they know or have met, and how they snake their way through society to ravage others around them in order to get ahead. Ultimately, the show whether purposely or inadvertently created an abstract measuring scale of morality, where the assumedly ""good"" people may wind up at the top, and the assumedly ""bad"" people may wind up as their victims on the bottom.

This makes intelligent viewers question their own morality, their view of the world and society, and it reinforces their perspectives on truth in an increasingly grey world when it comes to virtues."
10.0,14 September 2020,"Great Entertainment, lots of very creative, very new ideas, impressive characters, realistic storytelling. Also the development of the main characters over time was quite interesting to follow, real credible and consistent psycholical profiles. Also lots of funny ironies that make you chuckle. Only downside: I got quite some sleepless nights from being so eager to so the next episode ;-)"
10.0,20 July 2021,
10.0,3 September 2018,"Bryan Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman are one of the most memorable team mates in TV history. To watch how they evolve from amateur rookies into fully fledged drug lords is an everlasting intense rollercoaster journey. During the entire series, there is no dull moment or timefillers. It is a constantly evolving story with so many twists, parallell storylines and fantastic casting of unforgettable characters that it is almost unreal. It cannot get better than this. I watched the entire series in 2015 and since then I have watched all of the well known series including Sopranos, Wire , GOT, Mad Men etc etc. And this really still stands out as the perfection of TV series still waiting to be topped, if ever.

So everything else about this masterpiece have already been said in the reviews below. And this is just to make a fresh review to still confirm what everyone is raving about. If you haven't already, start watching Breaking Bad today, it will be a defining moment in your life!"
10.0,7 August 2021,How this much good series can be made...unbelievable.
10.0,14 May 2019,"The is a perfect show from beginning to end. Dedicating years of my life to GOT, just to watch it fall apart, makes me appreciate the complete masterpiece that this is. All Hail The King."
10.0,24 June 2021,I don't know how to describe a show that is so perfect nothing even comes close to a show like this while it may not be my all time favourite show there's no ignoring the absolute perfection of detail acting and storytelling of this show it really puts other shows to shame simply a perfect 10.

1.0,29 July 2021,"I'll just use one word for this series ""MASTERPIECE""."
10.0,14 November 2022,"Absolutely incredible, a masterpiece of the greatest geniuses. I'm going to be objective, the work has some flaws, but they don't portray the quality behind it, I'm talking in particular about the beginning of season 5, until hank understands who walter is, I I found the season extremely boring (so from ep 1 to 9) I found it to be repetitive in terms of the plot compared to the last seasons. Despite this, this series is simply incredible, almost everything is perfect, the acting, the cinematography, the artistic direction, the characters more than moving, extremely endearing, an absolutely breathtaking end, a most original plot although redundant by moment, uk emotional shock has every episode, literally a masterpiece which for me is the series that comes closest to perfection."
10.0,7 August 2013,"Television just does not get any better than this. Start with episode one and do not turn your head away for even a moment. Having probably heard everything that has already been said about ""Breaking Bad"", all I can say is it will blow your mind. The writing is to perfection, the actors and casting are right on and the suspense leaves you biting your fingernails and waiting around for the next episode in a state of shock. This storyline runs to perfection like a finely tuned engine or musical instrument and not a beat is missed. It seems selfish for the creators to be so selfish and end the series this year! Hey guys, how about, ""Breaking Bad, The Movie"" as a real final finale! Bring Heisenberg to the big screen!"

10.0,5 July 2020,"Perhaps it's my fault for watching Better Call Saul before BB but it happened by accident. However it makes things fall into place quite well for me. I think the actors are very good but this is just so overrated and I can't see what the fuss was about. I am wading my way through season 3 and it's like walking through treacle.

Walt and Pinkman are both despicable and totally unlikeable characters. Hank is an ass and Marie well she's the voice of doom and gloom in Fring is the only character I like.

I will keep watching until the end as I've started so I'll finish.

I do prefer Better Call Saul which is a far better show and funnier too."
6.0,16 October 2014,"I had heard a lot about this series, but somehow I found neither time nor ardor for watching it - several seasons, unknown actors to me, ambivalent topic... But recently, thanks to digital media opportunities, I took and watched all seasons in a succession - and I am glad I did so, as abstracts and flashbacks are not of much help if you have missed something, the contents is often sophisticated and versatile.

Season 1 was ambiguous to me, mostly due to the drug issue and the fact that Bryan Cranston reminded me strongly of Cary Oldman whom I like a lot, but then I found me chuckling in many scenes and I realized that I was watching a good black comedy (well, in later seasons, the number of those moments decreased), I got used to the actors and started to like them (particularly Cranston, RJ Mitte, Giancarlo Esposito), paid attention to skillful cinematography, musical background, crazy composition of events and scenes... Moreover, I noticed that the so-called good guys behaved often in an unpleasant manner, and I tend to forget that running drug business in nasty and lethal. I also obtained additional chemistry knowledge but I can promise I will never use it for criminal purposes :) All in all, it is a very good series, although not on my very top where 24, Sherlock Holmes and several Scandinavian crime series (e.g. Bron/Broen) are placed. Or perhaps I have not used to the creations were de facto criminals are more pleasant and elaborated than decent citizens; but I might change my views as I have begun to watch Dexter..."
1.0,10 April 2020,"This show is incredibly written and riveting for five seasons. Every single character is unique and compelling, every storyline is captivating and advances the characters. It delivers an incredible overarching lesson on morality and human nature without ever APPROACHING preachiness or deviating at all from what is true to the shows core. Without question, the greatest show I have ever seen and a true masterpiece."
10.0,11 May 2012,
10.0,29 December 2020,"I watched this show for the first time in April of 2015. I binged through the whole show in - I kid you not - 6 days, and I haven't been able to get over it ever since. Not only did the stars align with this one; all the surrounding planets did so as well. It's kinda tricky recommending this because nothing will ever hold up to the perfection that is this show, so it could ruin it for other shows you might want to watch. Then again you can never take tomorrow for granted, and this is something you have to check off before you die!"
10.0,21 May 2021,"Meh it's fine... If you feel like watching not only a good show but the best show, not only the best show but the best thing on TV, not only the best thing on TV, but the content ever produced by a species on earth, then maybe watch it. But I don't know it's fine..."
10.0,16 April 2013,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece, plain and simple. It stands toe-to-toe with the likes of The Wire, Mad Men, and The Sopranos in terms of smart writing, engaging characters, fantastic performances, and an immersive world. Not to mention, the show features my favorite acting performance of any medium, Bryan Cranston as Walter White.

Perhaps the most important point to mention is this does not feel like a TV show, but an experience that has been elevated above that plane with the help of impressive cinematography and equally impressive musical selection. It has a style to it that may not grip you at the start because we as a society have come to expect certain characteristics of TV shows that are not met here. Definitely by the end of the first season, however, you will be hooked, on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens to these characters. The best analogy I can make to better clarify is perhaps comparing Breaking Bad to the work of Tarantino and the Coen brothers. It's tense and violent, but also darkly comic at parts. Not to mention, there are many moments that will stick with you due to the show's incredible performances and style. I don't think I will ever forget the first time I watched the conclusion to the episode ""Crawl Space"" or the ending to the episode ""One Minute."" The show is a slow burn, but when that burn erupts, it spreads like wild fire, gripping you into its dark world.

Ultimately this show is a character study, taking an intelligent, but overall, normal family man, and turning him into a cold criminal. It delves into the psychology of his situation and engages the audience into asking themselves where they draw the line. As he deviates further and further from the norm, his crimes become more and more heinous. That being said, because we resonate so strongly with his characters original intentions, it is hard to condemn him for taking this terrible path. This complex show could have easily fallen apart if the lead performance did not reflect the complexity of the character, but luckily Bryan Cranston delivers episode after episode, more than deserving of his back-to-back-to-back Emmy wins. Even the supporting cast around him delivers. Aaron Paul's performances transcends our perceptions of his character at the start making him far more layered than we would have originally thought. Jonathan Banks creates a cool and slick killer... at the prime age of 60. Bob Odenkirk provides much comic relief while also supplying the later seasons with a moral compass, that is often ignored. Even the supporting roles of Anna Gunn and Betsy Brandt add to their seemingly one-dimensional characters and allow us to engage in their point of view on multiple viewings. I would be remiss to fail to mention Giancarlo Esposito, whose performance in season four rivals that of Cranston's making for one of my favorite supporting roles ever.

This is definitely a show to experience. Four and a half seasons in, and it has not missed a beat. Breaking Bad is the only show I can think of that gets better each successive season. It's characters become more engaging, the tension becomes more gripping, the dialogue becomes more thoughtful, and we as an audience are left in awe. The show will be ending come this summer and I can't wait to see the conclusion. Vince Gilligan has truly created a masterpiece."
10.0,15 August 2020,Perfect in all The detailing Performance Writing Camera work Etc
10.0,24 July 2015,"""Breaking Bad"" is one poignant, riveting, 60-hour long story of a single man's desperation. If you can make it past the first four episodes...you will simply find it addictive and hard to stop watching, once you understand the story's general premise. In fact, you'll have a marathon Netflix watching party, to the very end.

The acting and storyline is written and executed with meticulous precision and relevant accuracy. This is closer to reality, than ANY staged ""reality show"" currently on TV. If you ever wanted to know what the destructive effects of Methamphetamine is.....""Breaking Bad"" will send you on a one-way journey to Hell. There is NO return. The wake of death and destruction of everybody involved is so completely represented with this series. I cannot begin to conceive ways it could be depicted any more vividly.

Watch ""Breaking Bad"" with a clear, open mind and realize there is no ""religious"" destination known as Hell - it's made by man...."

9.0,1 July 2020,The most complete show ever. Absolutely no flaws. This show gets you hooked and the whole experience of watching walter white's transformation into heisenberg is extremely enthralling. The casting of this show is perfect. Bryan Cranston has played the protagonist with great finesse and one simply cannot imagine any other actor playing the role. All in all Vince Gilligan has set such high standards with breaking bad that no tv show will ever be able to match.
10.0,12 June 2021,Breaking bad isn't just about drugs and crime. The story is so good that you don't wanna miss one second of every scene in this series. The way they have developed the mane character is so perfect you have to se it for your self.
10.0,18 September 2020,The best tv series ever made. We can't compare any others series with breaking bad. Great storyline And great character devolvement
10.0,8 October 2020,"I had heard recommendations to watch this show..

Long story short.. Once you go on a road of bad choices..no matter how well are the intentions in the beginning.

You are headed on a dark path of no return and choices become only worse

The construct, acting, direction and setup itself of this show is great hence probably so well rated on IMDb

But yeah you kill some neurones in your brain for good 😂😂

I seriously suggest don't watch this unless you can handle dark shows. it's interesting at first but gets dark pretty soon.

Save your time and mind and watch something better. It's engaging and keeps you hooked to watch further."
7.0,16 May 2021,"I am evidently in the minority here but I will never understand the hype around this show. Its incredibly boring, I know its a drama not an action, but its got cartels, gangs, drugs,DEA, undercover operations, it has so much avenues that could inject some excitement into it, but instead it is the most boring show ever created, which when coupled with the fact that there isnt a single likeable character in the entire show, every single one of them are hateful, insufferable, irredeemable, stupid, just awful human beings. Unbearable characters being melodramatic and arguing over everything under the sun with nothing happening just doesnt do much for me personally."
1.0,16 October 2022,"RATED 9/10 Language: English Source: Netflix RECOMMENDED

This is well played game. The protagonist transformation and the situations are really awesome. Some cooked decisions are mind blowing one. The best one is ""this is not Meth"".

Really enjoyed and wanted more on the last season... They balanced the thrill and family sentiment perfectly... The negative side is that some episodes really tested the patience like ""the fly"", even though they gave the reason. Also the the family sentiment and husband and wife moral contradiction was too much and repeated towards the end of the series... I liked the ending and still haunting."
10.0,27 May 2017,"The arc of this character--series creator Vince Gilligan's invention of Walter White as a sick soul--is, it's clear now. One of the great narratives in Television history. Breaking Bad was a radical type of television, and also a very strange kind of must-watch: a show that you dread and crave at the same time. A show that managed year after year to accomplish that rare blend of Hollywood darling and fan favorite All the characters are written in a complex, deep and fascinating way. Series creator Vince Gilligan is a pure uncut genius and it shows behind and In front of the camera. Season 5 stands to up the ante more than any one prior, with fantastic twists, incredibly tense moments, more great standout music to fit the scenes properly, and acting that can't be beat. I came out of season 4 saying that there was no way to top the amazing conclusion to one of the greatest television seasons ever, but they have seemed to manage just that. Without giving too much away, relationships are tested, characters die, new bonds form, and more meth is cooked. I think it should be a crime to not watch this show, maybe equal to cooking meth with the intent to distribute.

This series is an absolute masterpiece. It is a work of art! If We had a chance to send a capsule of earths most important items to another planet, this series would have to be included! Not only did this show break bad but it broke the type of medium of television beyond the pit of mediocrity it usually resides in. It may be awhile for which a show of this caliber comes along, maybe once in a life time. This is a series that I will always cherish, and not just for the obvious reasons like the superb acting and the high stakes narrative -- but also for the fact that it gave me hope for the future of television, and the media's potential overall, to serve as a platform for talented writers and actors who actually have something inspired to say about the world we live in. Walter white is perhaps tvs best anti hero that you will feel dirty even rooting for till the very end, and what a perfect ending it is! This show has so much material that it gave birth to the brilliant prequel Better Call Saul. if you haven't had the privilege of seeing televisions arguably best of all time, congrats because you're about to embark on a journey like no other! You will wind up making 99% pure crystal blue meth and demand everyone call you Heisenberg. But seriously, you now have 5 seasons to binge watch on Netflix. I envy you!"
10.0,3 November 2013,"I will not waste your time with a long a detailed review. You could spend the time better starting the inevitable Breaking Bad marathon you will undertake the second you finish episode 1. You cannot carry on in your life without watching this. I took me less than a week to watch all 5 seasons. I have never been so emotionally moved by a TV series. The actors took their roles to a whole new level. I was not familiar with them until this production. I will now relish the opportunity to see them in past and future roles. Every episode leaves you on a hair pulling cliff hanger dieing of desperation to watch the next. I cannot imagine the pain that people went through waiting week after week to watch this. I'n the end you are left with an award worthy final episode that will not only entertain you, it will move you and will leave you satisfied with no question unanswered. Your only option its to watch this masterpiece, it will complete you."
10.0,11 September 2013,
10.0,18 June 2013,"Seldom, if ever, does a simple television show reach and exploit the dramatic heights and potential of its medium.

It does this using two of the most unlikely and unassuming individuals in the business to carry across to the viewers their journey; to trust in them the goal of making that journey worth following.

Breaking Bad does that. The writing is simple and powerful; written in both detailed and broad strokes. Nothing is said without deep meaning behind it. The most simple and innocuous interactions have symbolic meaning. You won't be cheated.

It seems it would be nearly impossible for any age or gender to watch this show without feeling its theme in their bones; pertinent to them.

Life, death, ultimate meaning ... right, wrong. Love, lies, manipulation .. and power.

The cinematography is worth watching the series alone for. It's crystal clear, stunning Western portraits ... extended shots, absolute beauty to match absolute corruption.

Nothing means anything without characters who are memorable. We care deeply about these characters: Particularly the two leads, Walter and Jessie. I don't think anybody would/could have imagined the evolution Walter's character was capable of, let alone that of Jessie's. It's not a show that's been dragged out for money, it's not a show that was cut short. It's just right.

Seldom do you see this level of beauty through this medium. It transcends its medium. Would it be too much to ask for a movie ... to follow the series? If not, I will not complain. I'll be re-watching the show for years to come.

Masterpiece."

This show draws you in every time you watch it. The attention to detail and the performances of it come together to create something truly special. There are lots of different types of emotions I have felt when watching this show, I feel like I connect with it on a deeper level.

Even if he has became a criminal, his motive was always his family, even if he has said he did for himself. Better call saul is also a masterpiece.

5.0,5 October 2024,"It keeps you watching, I'll give it that and suppose that's the point. Some really brilliant scenes and acting but the timescales are a mess, the character development is beyond ridiculous and to be honest some of the episodes are just boring . Jesse goes from doesn't care, to empathetic, to trying to kill folk to nice intelligent guy back to dumb ass in a week ( blame it on the drugs )Walt becomes a characature of himself and the tough guy image is pretty poor. The best character is Gus by a mile brilliantly portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito . Just very difficult to care for anyone in the whole programme, it's fine having flaws but mostly a group of ridiculously annoying people who unfortunately for the whole, stay alive. It's a good programme and some of the cinematography is unbelievable as is the acting, can see why it's won so many awards but like a lot of programmes with more than 2 seasons it suffers from being a bit of the same stories rehashed in another bizarre way , all set in such a small timeline ."
10.0,16 September 2022,"It's good, yes. That's it. 9.5 good? Hell nah. The Vince Gilligan universe fanboys have made sure this has the highest ratings on IMDB, but the truth is far from that. On any other day, this shows would get a solid 8.5 rating.

It's slow, boring, and honestly it feels stupid at times. Granted, it's fiction but c'mon. In real life there's not pure meth, there's no lord Mr. Boring Former Professor walking the streets of Albuquerque or whatever riddle with cancer and being the ultimate drug lord. Some of the characters feel so cartoonish, like Hank, Marie, the son, the wife. Women seem to be written to be lame, crazy, irrational, stupid. Walter blowing up things, being the ultimate drug lord... Geez, he would be dead in no more than 2 seasons if not for plot armor.

This show is surrounded by the biggest hype ever, so when someone watch it if they don't know how to think for themselves and/or are fanboys of antihero sagas, whether or not silly, they fall for it. Most of my friends who love the show, are into drugs. Coincidence?

Breaking Bad is that shows whose hardcore fans try so hard to be the best show in history, but it isn't. And they can get very aggressive if you don't share their blind love for the show. That right there is the second thing that spoils this show for me, the first one being that the show is good, maybe very good if the first 4 seasons are not taking into account.

Most overrated thing on tv ever made."
10.0,12 October 2019,This show is just the best of acting & writing that you can get. All my friends agree with me.
10.0,19 June 2021,"This is the smartest show ever made, so well written, everything happens for a reason. The writing, the directing, the acting, all is perfectly done. The cast is also full with talented actors with a lot of passion. The ultimate drama tv show for sure."

10.0,26 August 2022,"I'm hospitalized. Luckily the hospital provides a smart hd tv, so i can log in with my netflix. I finished watching it for about a week. Really loved the storyline, the journey of his cancer and how to deal with it. Most of the series 'trying to hard' with the plot to pursue the audiences to keep watching, but this one is not. Every episode ends with a magnificient shot. Each of the actor and actresses bring the character to life, you can feel the awkward scene, the anger, sadness.

There's was an episode that is so intense, captured with an excellent cinematography that brought chill down to my spine.

Agreed with everyone, this is the best series of all time."
8.0,30 September 2023,"One of the reasons why this series became popular with me and all the people was that an ordinary person, without being born in a special family, or without being a criminal before, chooses a new path for his life for certain reasons.

And because usually most people are normal, they like breaking the norm and understand the sense of power, and this is a very beautiful and sweet The two main actors excelled in their roles as if they were meant for them.

The script of this series was amazing, the process of turning a teacher into a methamphetamine producer was really well shown.

The creators of this series were able to show us how the main characters of the series change their previous lives.

Some of the dialogues of this series will remain in the mind forever.

Unlike other series that are good but end very badly, this series had an ideal ending, not too good and happy and not too sad and depressing.

You can live with this series and it is beyond a normal series."

1.0,19 August 2018,"Plot was too similar to Death Note to really enjoy it though. First and last seasons were a bit boring but those seasons in the midlle were kind of nicely done.

I hated all main characters except Jessy Pinkman, they were so obnoxious and hypocritical I just couldn't sympathize with them. That being said I appreciated cast choices and perforformace actors gave. Also dialogues are very well written.

Remarkable shots of amazing landscapes and quality camera work alongside with those pros I've already mentioned make this series totally worth watching."
10.0,22 October 2019,I'm so mad people kept telling me to finish this. This is the WORST show ever.
10.0,13 June 2023,"When I started the show I was years late. I was a boy. A boy that didn't understand the hype and love BB has received over the years. So I sat my jolly ass down, sparked a fat doobie, and started Ep 1. I envy anyone who hasn't seen this show, as I wish I can simply rewatch it without any memory of this masterpiece.

After I finally finished the show, after you know who drives away from it all. I became a man filled with hate towards Skyler, the true antagonist. I became lost, I began soul searching, wondering, truly asking myself ""Why did it take me so long to watch this?"" If you still haven't seen this show, you have been wasting your time watching anything else."
10.0,30 January 2023,"Some good stuff here, if u like police cases, drug dealers, mafia, very good humor, family based and friendship movies... ayo mister White you truly need to see this. The show is the best of the best, long but short if your mind is taking questions after every episode like whats gonna happen next ? I like every single personage on this, the story is sensational and i recommend it to watch it minimum 2 times. And after watch El Camino (after story movie) you won t regret it. I can t believe that this storyline is from 2008 to 2013, i think is so old if i am gonna thinking overall buttt, i can t believe eithee how truly amazing, good and unique is. Recomend it !!!!"

10.0,11 April 2020,"I don't usually acknowledge television shows for their efforts but I have to say that Breaking Bad is an exception. I genuinely do not think that there will ever be a show that can beat this show's standards, let alone having THE best ending to any show ever made.

Cheers to Breaking Bad, no wonder they got a million nominees and awards"
7.0,24 February 2024,"🏆100%

Breaking Bad is an absolute masterpiece, each Season is better than the last. This Series includes in my opinion the Best Episode of all Television, and the greatest Season of all Television. Breaking Bad is about a chemistry teacher named Walt, this chemistry teacher later finds out he has lung cancer and he will likely die sometime soon. So to make sure his family has enough money for when his time comes he becomes a methamphetamine manufacturer, and he teams up with an old student of his that goes by the name Jesse. With things already being risky enough, Walt has to deal with his brother-in-law who is apparently a DEA Agent that goes by the name Hank. Overall this Series is an absolute Masterpiece, and it ends in the Best way possible!

🏆90% (SEASON 1): 4.5/5

🏆90% (SEASON 2): 4.5/5

🏆94% (SEASON 3): 4.5/5

🏆100% (SEASON 4): 5/5

🏆100% (SEASON 5): 5/5."
1.0,27 December 2013,"Don't get me wrong, i liked this show. But its not the best on television like everyone keeps ranting. There's a lot to like, and it deserves at least some hype, maybe not as much as its been credited.

This is a really dark show and i honestly get depressed when i watch more than an episode in a row. It depicts really well a downward spiral of a high school chemistry teacher to the ruler of a meth empire... This is no rise to glory.

The characters are very realistic and the whole thing has an air of cinema verite. Its not a feelgood show, its moody, quiet, and then loud, and then agonizing, and then grim. The episodes usually start out with some strange inanimate object foreshadowing future events, just odd enough to peak your interest. An eyeball floating in a pool, a tarantula walking in the sand, etc. The people in the show are unidealized and flawed in their own ways. Walter with his egomaniacal rages, sometimes to the point of embarrassing himself. Skyler with her underhandedness, and her sister with her lies and shoplifting, Hank with his gruff bravado. If you like shows that seem like they could actually happen in real life, this is the show for you.

I really liked Gus Fring's character. It was a really cool change of pace to see a drug kingpin so different from what you'd expect. Careful, timid, polite. Everything you don't expect from a meth dealer. Even before then, Crazy 8 and tuco both seem like gangbangers i've met in real life, and they capture the erratic sociopathy and fearmongering quite well. Jesse seems like the guy i used to buy weed from a while back. Its clear the writers have actually experienced a bit of the drug world before and are not out of their depth.

In my opinion, the show doesn't get really good until season 4. Even then i still wouldn't put it in my top 5. Its a well made piece of television, but perhaps its just a matter of preference. Its suspenseful at times, but not all the time. There are some very undeniably badass moments when i cheered, such as Gus taking on the cartel, or Erhmantraut's lake scene (no spoilers!) but i'm just not always in the mood to get all cynical about life like i do after watching Walter for too long. I swear this show is gonna turn me into an alcoholic.

Final note: I love Saul Goodman, such a classic scumbag and always with some really memorable quotes. I would not be opposed to a ""Better Call Saul"" spin off, preferably with more humor and dirty tricks"
10.0,3 May 2020,I watched all seasons and for me this is the most boring show ever. Dont like it a bir. Overhyped and overrated
10.0,11 December 2019,Best show ever made don't fight me in this. If you love breaking bad should go better call saul after you end this show.
10.0,12 April 2020,"Not a single episode is unnecessary. This series was building a devastating and unbelievably big construct of lies and unfortunate situations - simply amazing. Acting 10/10, suspense 10/10, story 10/10.

Not only in its own genre at the very top. I'll never forget this ride."
10.0,25 May 2019,Thanks to writer of the shows What an amazing show. Bryan and Aaron Paul nailed it.. Start to end not a single second bored. Must Watch!!
10.0,25 April 2024,This show if by far the best show. The acting is just so good you can put it to words. Even its worst episode is a masterpiece. If you haven't already WATCH THIS SHOW NOW. The last few episode are actually crazy. None stop action. This show moves very fag though so if you don't like that this may not be for you. If you like slow paced shows then you should go to better call saul cause you need this universe in your brain. My favorite episodes are of course the popular ones like Ozymandias Fillina and Fave off. But even less popular ones like fly or better call saul are really good. By the way breaking bad is hard to start but trust me to stick with it.
10.0,22 May 2023,"From start to finish I loved every second of this show. From its exciting bits to the truly dark depressing moments. It displays how a good man can turn bad. Truly one of the best shows ever made and my personal favourite.

Jesse pinkman is the most underrated character and I think as one of Aaron Paul's first performances he did more than an amazing job at playing the character, episodes that I enjoyed the most were Ozymandias, Felina and face off. I would definitely recommend this to anyone above the age of 14, where as I would watch it at around 16+, not because of the adult themes, just to really appreciate the storyline and deeper meaning to the program."
10.0,18 September 2019,"Call me mad, I had seen breaking Bad 5 times

Yes 5 times, and I think this's a unique art even made in the history"
10.0,2 March 2019,"I have seen this show three times already and am watching it again for my fourth time, and yet the more I watch, the better it gets... I understand a character that I previously didn't, I have a better grasp at the characters' feelings and motives, I understand the subtleties and nuances of every shot, I see the story flow and unravel gracefully, I hear how every character has his/her own usage of the language and voice, and much much more.

I wish I could find the perfect set of words where I could describe this perfect show, but until then, this is my analysis."
7.0,27 December 2020,The best tv show i have ever seen Bryan Cranston gave the best singles performance I have seen in TV history And all the actors were amazing.
2.0,2 October 2020,"9.5 rating is inflated. This is a solid 8/10 show...not a 9.5. I expected more. The show just left me feeling awful despite the interesting action and plot. Everything goes bad, innocents die, corruption everywhere....not a lot of fun during a pandemic."
10.0,8 June 2019,"So boring , some characters are unbelievable.rhythm are so slow."
10.0,8 December 2021,"I get the Bluray's out and watch this series every year or two and it's truly held up to the test of time. It takes us on the path of a mild-mannered chemistry teacher and let's us watch him become a monster who kills everyone who gets in his way. One has to wonder how many monsters start out this way. The beaten down nobody who finally gets power and abuses it. It's a truly great series when you take it that way. And I'm giving it a 10 rating as a whole. But not every episode is a 10. Some episodes are dogs. You have to take it as a whole. Because, realistically, someone could watch a single episode and say 'this sucks'. And they would be right. But it's necessary to see the good AND BAD when building character development. That's why I think the series deserves a 10 rating. Devote enough time to binge a season at a time and you won't be disappointed!"
10.0,25 October 2019,"It is no exaggeration.This is, literally, the best show that's ever been made. Bar none.I have seen it 3 times through, and nothing compares to it. The only thing I can think of would be seasons 1-4 of GoT, but that all went downhill.

Breaking bad has amazing acting, characters, stories, villains, dialogue. You name it. I would recommend it to absolutely everyone.

10/10. Nothing will ever top it."
10.0,7 February 2021,"I watched this series 5 times an counting.... it´s impressive how Vince manage to create such a master piece.... perfect timing, characters, storyboard, music, trama, shootings, color grade... everything manage to be in perfect balance. So far the best series i have seen in my life!!"
10.0,18 April 2021,"Just watch it. This show is perfect in virtually every way. Every episode serves a purpose, every character is dense and interesting. You're doing yourself a favor by watching this show."
10.0,4 October 2021,Agitate your friends to put 10 for this masterpiece. Any position other than the first one is a pure crime.
10.0,27 February 2020,Bryan Cranston God of Acting!!! played Walter White character to perfection....character development is awesome.....Aaron Paul piece of Art.....supporting characters well done.....Vince Gilligan Numero Uno....Best series of all time....no one can match the perfection of Breaking Bad.....lots of love & respect to the team
10.0,17 October 2021,If you think it's a good webseries then you're wrong because it's the best .😉 From beginning to the end it will stick your eyes on the screen . But I will recommend you not to watch more than 2 episodes per day if you really wanna enjoy it .
7.0,1 February 2023,"BrBa (Breaking Bad) follows Walter White, a chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer as he develops a methamphetamine business. Walter is one of a cast incredibly written characters in a show with nothing short of perfection when it comes to everything.

S1 to S5 are truly the best episodes of TV ever, with S5 E12 Ozymandias being the highest rated episode of anything ever (10 Stars)

Watch this show ASAP. You will not regret it. Instead you will witness the best piece of TV and maybe even Fiction ever. You will be on the edge of your seat, crying and laughing throughout, and sometimes multiple at once

I repeat - WATCH Breaking Bad."
1.0,18 July 2022,"I don't really like watching Breaking Bad, to a large extent because Lao Bai, the best wife and pig teammate, is selfish and selfish, unreasonable and unreasonable. When he encounters an accident, he will only cry loudly and cry, and use his own vulnerability to kidnap others. Sympathy, complain and complain when there is a problem, instead of trying to solve it, to appease and help others, you can hardly see the responsibility as a wife and mother from her."
10.0,1 September 2020,Extremely slow and too much build up. can't guess the most liked show by people would turn out to be very very slow
10.0,26 December 2020,This tv show is the best show of all time even better than the sopranos and the wire
10.0,26 August 2022,I love this show. Outstanding performance. Great script. I can write a long review but you just have to watch this show. Bryan Cranston plays the best role of his life.

10.0,9 August 2019,"Greatest series i've ever seen.. Story., acting, direction everything is great.."
10.0,9 February 2020,I'm at a loss for words to describe this show...so I'll just say...Best TV show we might ever see
10.0,17 March 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a TV series about a high school chemistry teacher who starts making drugs. It's the most highly rated TV show ever and is loved for its intense story and interesting characters. The main character, Walter White, gets deeper into the criminal world as the show goes on. The writing is really good, and the actors, especially Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, do a great job. The show keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you care about the characters over five seasons.

The person who made the show, Vince Gilligan, tells a story that's exciting and makes you think about things like right and wrong, family, and what happens when you make choices. The way the show looks is cool, especially with the scenes in New Mexico. It's also cool how the show pays attention to small details and gets the science right, especially with chemistry and making drugs.

""Breaking Bad"" is a show that's always good, even though it can be dark and tough sometimes. But there are also funny and nice moments. Watching the show is like going on a journey with the characters and it's something you won't forget. It's different from other shows because it's about a not-so-good guy, but that's what makes it special in TV history."

10.0,10 July 2023,"If there was one thing left on my bucket list I could do that I never did, I would rewind the clock back to before I ever watched Breaking Bad, and then I would carve out one week of my life, dim the lights, and binge watch it for about five days without knowing anything about it, no spoilers, and just enjoy the best movie snack food while witnessing the greatest piece of filmmaking ever made, at least in the past several decades.

I'd cut out all connections and communication with anyone in the outside world who had already seen the show so as not to be spoiled by any small detail, and just sit in awe and astonishment at the best piece of art that filmmaking of any kind has seen, possibly ever.

The combination of acting, writing, plot, directing, cinematography, character development, world building, originality, creativity, editing, music, and storytelling is simply and truly unbeatable.

I've been a lover of movies, acting, and tv for my whole entire life, and when I say that Breaking Bad might possibly be the greatest work of art in the history of Hollywood, I don't say it lightly. It is more addictive in every way than the fictional meth the show deals with on every level of storytelling.

There are many classics that carved out uncharted achievement in filmmaking history- and Breaking Bad is definitely one of the handful of unforgettable classics and watching experiences. It is actually so good that it's not even believable that anything this good actually got made.

If I could erase my memory, take a week off of work, dim the lights, and lock myself in a room for a week with popcorn and snacks, I guarantee that watching this show without knowing any spoilers would be hands down one of the greatest life experiences imaginable. Masterpiece on every single level."
10.0,15 November 2020,"Breaking bad, The story of your average chemistry teacher turned to drug kingpin. The episodes of this show will have you on the edge of your seat thinking ""WHATS GONNA HAPPEN NEXT!"". You will feel the sheer intenseness of the show because the acting is absolutely incredible.

Breaking bad has the best writing in the history of TV. Seasons 1-3 lay the base for the incredible seasons of 4 and 5. But that does not mean they are completely pointless. They definitely have there share of amazing episodes.

Breaking bad has the best series finale in the history of television. Breaking bad also has the only episode of TV with a perfect 10 star review and that is with over 100,000 reviews. Breaking bad also has many episodes with 9.5 stars and above. But don't let the reviews speak for them self give this truly amazing thriller of a show a watch."
10.0,6 October 2023,"""Breaking Bad stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the realm of television series. Its intricate narrative architecture, compelling character development, and meticulous attention to detail elevate it to the pinnacle of storytelling excellence. The series artfully navigates the transformation of Walter White from a meek chemistry teacher to a formidable drug lord, weaving morality and consequences into the very fabric of its plot.

Vince Gilligan's vision manifests in every frame, crafting an immersive world where every choice echoes with significance. The cinematography, marked by its stark visuals and symbolic framing, becomes a visual metaphor for the moral descent of its characters.

What sets Breaking Bad apart is its ability to juxtapose intense action sequences with poignant moments of introspection. It delves into the moral gray areas, posing challenging questions about the human condition. The ensemble cast, led by Bryan Cranston's stellar performance, adds layers of complexity to the characters, making them both relatable and enigmatic.

The series also showcases the scientific underpinnings of its plot, incorporating accurate chemistry concepts that add authenticity to the narrative. Each episode unfolds like a meticulously crafted chapter in a gripping novel, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.

Breaking Bad transcends genre boundaries, combining elements of crime, drama, and thriller seamlessly. It doesn't merely entertain; it provokes contemplation on morality, choices, and the consequences of one's actions. Undoubtedly, Breaking Bad's legacy extends beyond the screen, firmly establishing itself as a benchmark for storytelling excellence in the world of television."""

10.0,1 August 2021,"I have seen The Sopranos, The Wire, Boardwalk Empire, etc but nothing stuck with me like BB. Watching for the first time in 2014 was special and unique, but for me it has the most re-watchability of any show I've seen and after watching BCS it holds even more weight as characters like Gus, Mike, and Saul have more development. 10/10 utterly flawless. Vince Gilligan is a genius."
7.0,8 May 2022,"I have just watched the entire series for a second time and I am left with some real doubts. It is fantastic series but as the episodes build up it loses uts way, has some real duds and totally stupid and unbelievable plot lines. Is it dark comedy or social commentary? In the end, who cares? Wonderful acting overcomes some very poor scripts and quirky direction. You will get to love and hate all of the characters - none of them are perfect. Do we see ourselves in their flaws? Again, who cares? I guess that understanding the series is dictated by how you watch it and binge watching might make one more critical than the weekly anticipation and satisfaction of waiting for each weekly episode/new series. I certainly didn't enjoy it as much on the second watch, which was a binge watch in under a week. I know, I have too much time on my hands."

10.0,28 December 2020,This tv show it's just mind blowing wish i could've delete it from my memory so i can watch it Again just feeling so good ...you can't miss this ..you should Just watch it
6.0,18 December 2013,
1.0,6 February 2021,I am told it gets better but the first two seasons have been insanely boring. Only reason I keep watching is because everyone says it's so good...
10.0,13 December 2022,"Breaking Bad for sure has to be one of the greatest shows of all time , even though it started slow and unpopular it began to rise incredibly, The end was fantastic and fulfilling like not many shows nowadays, The whole universe is fantastic and currently waiting for more spin-offs including Gus , Mike etc, Even though im 3/4 into Better Call Saul i dont feel the same addiction to watch it as much as i felt watching Breaking Bad its a good show however lacks that clear stortyline and individual character excellence such as Walters part in BB , Perfection 10/10 %100 worth your time , Addiction Warning!"
10.0,2 August 2021,"Best tv show ever.

Thank you for this masterpiece ."
10.0,29 December 2020,"Best tv show ever, incredible acting, amazing characters, love all of them."
10.0,2 January 2019,This show makes the rest of tv look terrible and is more amazing than it has any right to be.
10.0,14 April 2020,"Each & Every Characters are best at it's role! Walter White, Jesse Pinkman, Gustavo Fring, Saul Godman, Hank, Mike everyone are mindblowing."
10.0,22 May 2021,I would say this is among the best TV series I have ever watched. It reflects the characters' emotions and their inner worlds. Also the development of unpredictable events is another attractive side of the series.
10.0,29 January 2023,
10.0,23 April 2020,I always argue with everyone this show is the greatest of all and Better Call Saul is the 2nd greatest
7.0,1 November 2022,
5.0,25 June 2021,"What is the point of watching a man self destruct, murder people, sob uncontrollably, lie and slowly die? There has to be better ways to spend precious time on this earth."
10.0,24 October 2018,"Normally i don't write reviews, but after i finished this series finally i felt the necessity to write one down. why breaking bad is one of the best tv series ever made? because it's one of the most realistic ones which focused on human nature and how life can transform us, how a simple man can become a monster, pure evil and at the same moment the total opposite, how he was so scared, weak and helpless then become the master of his life and what exactly does he wants to do. his mentality has changed same as his character, he became brand new human after he knew he had lung cancer, this show is his struggle to secure his family future and leave them what they need so when time comes they wouldn't suffer. only that he didn't know that his actions and lies will complicate their lives and bring hell to their doors, their lives have never been the same after the choices he made and the consequences of all of them. i am left speechless and there are no words can describe this show now matter how hard i try to enjoy it."
10.0,28 April 2020,"Opening scenes of each episode really are something. Truth is I would run out of superlatives talking about this masterpiece. The acting the story the ending, everything about this show is perfect.

One of the best that's for sure."
10.0,8 April 2019,"Incredibly well written piece of art. The science, drama, comedy, crime, adventure...all are mixed and balanced into a story that keeps you magically glued to your seat the whole time. There is no other show that is worth binge watching than breaking bad. From season 1 pilot to season 5 felina the tv characters enter your real life and intervene in your day to day tasks making you a hopeless addict of the show.

All the glory and honor to the creator Vince Gilligan and world class actors Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Dean Norris along with other cast members, writers and production staff.

This show will be admired and marveled in the history books as a masterpiece second only to Shakespeare's Hamlet."
10.0,24 May 2020,GREATEST OF ALL TIME...... YOU COULDNT IMAGINE ANY BETTER MUST WATCH
10.0,5 February 2021,Currently my third watch through of this this show and its still a masterpiece every time. From the acting to the story and the great character development throughout the entire series. This is a must watch for everyone.
10.0,17 April 2024,
10.0,11 November 2015,"I may not have watched hundreds of TV shows, but this one is certainly the greatest of them all. Excellent cinematography, brilliant direction, Oscar-worthy performances, great background songs, fantastic dialog, outstanding mix of humor, action, drama, romance and tension, mind-blowing twists, and overall the most perfect TV show ever created. Every actor is excellent, even those who appear for only a couple of episodes, absolutely outstanding villains, fantastic story, every single shot is golden, and it's the show that put basically every actor who was on the show a worldwide hit. This show can make you cry, laugh, get chills, fell intense, put your on the edge of your sit, scream and much more. This show is an absolute gold. I watched it twice and every time you remember why this show is much more than perfect."
10.0,3 September 2021,"If someone makes a game out of Breaking Bad, it's disrespectful to Breaking Bad and the crew. If it had been made into a mini-series, it would not have been able to film the mawkishness after six years. If it is made into a movie or a movie series, it will be made into a work of one episode and one story, without the tension of the plot. If it had been written as a book, it would not have been able to describe the performance of the actors, the subtlety of the plot, and the most important thing is that the song did not have the final sublimation. So Breaking Bad will always be one of a kind, hard to beat. You have to watch 62 episodes to get that."
7.0,8 July 2018,"Started off very strong in season 1 and 2! In series 3 it felt like more and more of the same concept. The story dragged along, and did not grab me anymore. In 2011 I watched the first 3 series in a row. I'd better give it a break after series 2. Should pick it up again at series 4..."
1.0,10 May 2010,"When this show first appeared I liked it very much. However, as time went on I found it less and less attractive because of its violence, which I found excessive. In fact I stopped watching somewhere in the middle of the second season.

I decided to give it another try for the third season. I am again struck by the good quality of the acting, and I enjoy its being set in Albuquerque, I city that I have spent some time in.

HOWEVER. The violence is still excessive. I also find, that with the exception of Walt Jr., there is no character that I find even remotely appealing. Of course, the ""law breakers"" are uniformly bad and vicious, but so are the law enforcers, with Hank bordering on homicidal. Walt's wife is a singularly unpleasant woman and her sister is no better.

If the program offers any lesson it is that our drug laws produce much more harm than the drugs."
10.0,30 March 2016,"This is a suspenseful TV show with superb acting from Bryan Cranston, from Malcolm in the Middle, and Aaron Paul. The storyline is great because it is all a huge dilemma in the first couple of seasons for Mr. White because on the one hand he must provide for his family, but on the other he knows what he is doing is illegal and he has never broke the law before. In season two though you clearly see the transformation from someone with this dilemma to someone whose a bad ass. Also it has great writing because it incorporates enough comic relief to make the subject less dark and throws in new characters while still making sense. However, seasons two through three are very slow due to necessary character development that builds up to seasons four through five which are phenomenal with an epic ending that will take your breath away."
10.0,11 October 2021,"Re-watched for 3 times in different languages, absolute masterpiece and enormous flow of emotions."
10.0,12 September 2021,I've re watched this show at least 3 times and I've got to say this is the most addicting and most well written series that maintains its viewer attention throughout all episodes (apart from the one with the fly)
10.0,12 September 2021,"No words Yo!! The last episode name is very thoroughly decided, i.e. Felina - is a portmanteau of ""Fe"", ""Li"" and ""Na"", the symbols for iron, lithium and sodium, or shorthand for ""blood, meth and tears""."
10.0,10 April 2021,"THis show is going to be the gold standard to all otehr shows in the future. It did everything expcetionally well. Amazing acting, phenomenal storytelling, just wath it if you somehow haven't."
10.0,16 November 2019,"Will in the season 1 i was waiting for something big, because from what I heard about this show it's ""Legendary"" show, but the season one was normal one. Same goes to season two and three, In the fourth season it became more interesting and the show attracts you more than before. But when we talk about season five will it's fucking another story the last season was the best. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this show. I will give it 8/10 🙏🏼"
10.0,10 April 2021,Now I just want to wipe out my memory just to watch it again and get those feelings back. Unforgettable. An Absolute masterpiece.
10.0,14 December 2022,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan.

The best Drama of the Twenty First Century hands down.

This show has changed my life. The subtle details and the attention to such details is simply stunning.

Absolutely the only show to deserve a 10/10 rating. So many memorable lines."
1.0,22 September 2021,"This was a great idea but it anoyed me a lot, the cutting of scenese where they just stare at each other but dont talk such a high pressure situation would not occur like this. Skylars character was horrible and jesse was soo keen on the money but once he has it he throws it away its a bit silly. It dragged on too lng."
10.0,6 November 2020,What a waste of time. This drama series is so Boring and overrated.
9.0,25 March 2019,The whole show is a dramatic rollercoaster. The characters are realistic and you really grow onto them . You can see how Walter and Jesse mature thoughout the series. Its a must watch
10.0,30 October 2015,"This show = Meth. Its not just a TV show, its an experience. Period. Thats it guys, I have no more to say, I just want to express my feeling about the show because I love it so much that I have to say it out loud. OK I run out of words. All the things I write started from here is just pure rubbish that you and I don't really care as it is meaningless. You can choose to read or not I don't really care because the objective is to achieve 10 lines of text, a guideline is a statement by which to determine a course of action which means that I have to follow it so that I do not break the rules, I hope the admin don't ban me because I lack of the trait of imaginative and English is not my primary language. Wow I already reached 10 lines, thank you. I still want to say that I love Breaking Bad. KThxBye"
10.0,8 May 2024,"Oh Goodness! It's been a week since I finished Breaking Bad and I joke you not, I've been feeling so unhappy and lonely like I am missing something. I really felt like I was part of them. Like I was actually in the picture with them the whole time and suddenly, I'm all alone now.

God, how I wish I could erase my memories so I could start it all over again!

Breaking Bad, hands down the greatest show EVER. 10/10.

Let me just add something more, guess what? I have been seeing them in my dreams every night lately like it's a new season! And the saddest part, it was yet another dream.

Ya'll go watch it immediately if you haven't already!"
10.0,31 August 2023,
10.0,19 April 2020,One of the best tv series i have ever watched. Easily top of my list. The most engrossing show you will probably ever watch. Bryan Cranston (Walter White) and Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) are incredible together. Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring) character and performance is so incredibly powerful and cold every time he comes on screen your on edge.
10.0,28 December 2020,One of the best tv show i have ever watched just amazing must watch
10.0,15 April 2020,Simply the best. GOAT Sleepless nights That's all folks.
3.0,22 April 2021,This shows has the best episodes and stories in tv history. Not one episode is bad.
10.0,7 September 2018,
10.0,8 September 2023,"The initial few seasons primarily revolve around witnessing Walter's journey into drug manufacturing, and this process is both dull and repetitive. The character development is not captivating or compelling enough to keep me engaged. The show's pacing is sluggish, which is frustrating.

Breaking Bad is often touted as an anti-hero tale, but there are better productions that explore similar themes. The story of Walter White endangering his own family and getting involved in the drug trade essentially relies on the cliché of ""good person gone bad."" This theme has been explored in various TV shows and films, and BB doesn't bring much novelty to it.

While it is widely celebrated by both critics and audiences, it does not fully justify the praise it has received. Its slow-paced narrative and character development diminished my interest in the series. Of course, it can be an unforgettable experience for many, but it remains merely an ordinary series for me."
10.0,15 February 2023,
10.0,16 April 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word, a show that transcends television and becomes an experience in itself. From its gripping storyline to its impeccable cast and breathtaking cinematography, every aspect of this series is finely crafted to perfection.

The journey of Walter White from a high school chemistry teacher to a drug lord is not just a tale of crime and consequences; it's a profound exploration of human nature, morality, and the choices we make when pushed to the edge. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of legendary, capturing the transformation from a mild-mannered man to a ruthless criminal with such depth and nuance that it's impossible not to be captivated.

The supporting cast, including Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman and the host of other talented actors, adds layers of complexity to the narrative, making every character feel real and compelling. The chemistry between the characters is palpable, drawing viewers into their world and keeping them on the edge of their seats with each twist and turn.

One of the show's greatest strengths is its ability to balance intense drama with moments of dark humor and unexpected humanity. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps you invested from the first episode to the last.

Visually, ""Breaking Bad"" is a work of art. The cinematography captures the vastness of the New Mexico landscape while also delving into the claustrophobic interiors where much of the drama unfolds. Every shot is meticulously crafted, adding depth and meaning to the storytelling.

What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its commitment to storytelling excellence. It doesn't shy away from difficult themes or moral ambiguity but tackles them head-on, challenging viewers to question their own beliefs and perceptions.

Overall, ""Breaking Bad"" is not just a show; it's a transformative experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this gripping, thought-provoking, and utterly unforgettable journey."
9.0,16 April 2020,"It's a master class. An outstanding writing and cinematography. Brilliant characters. Unstoppable story moving over and over.

You will get crazy after it's end because your life will never be the same. You will never experience this type of tv show anymore."
10.0,14 November 2019,"After wanting to watch this series through , after so much accolades it has been given, and starting a few episodes quite a few times but having to cease for various reasons, finally was in position to be able to. Sorry I waited but dang was it worth it to finally get through it! Everything that's been written, reviewed, praised... all 100 % accurate!!! I was SO blown away by in particular the last season which even had me talking to the TV which I have only done in one other TV series, which was "" The Shield"" , which I consider to be the best ""Cop"" show ever! As been said, absolutely everything about this show from creation, writing, acting , directing, filming etc. etc. just off the charts and I will be revisiting it hopefully many more times in my remaining lifetime! It is certainly deserving of all the attention, awards and praise it has received- "" Yo bi*ches""😁"
10.0,14 April 2020,"Whata writing, casting everything is perfect each one of the cast deserve a great moments. i think the television history cannot come in to this way everything in this series perfect I loved it oh god..."
10.0,5 September 2022,
1.0,30 July 2022,Amazing show see walter white and jesse pinkman evolve throught the series was amazing the character are great and the acting is one of the best. Season 4 and 5 are one of the best season in tv show I ever watch. Im really excited to watch better call saul.
10.0,20 December 2020,"Everything about this show...amazing. The actors, the characters, the writing, the plot...all top notch. And it didn't drag out, 5 seasons was perfect"
10.0,11 August 2020,"To me, it was addicting. It was so that you wanted to watch it in order to figure it out what will happen next. But all was ok till The last season which it seems The writer of the series got out of ideas and wanted to finish it somehow interesting but OMG it could be really better! Much long conversations like just for spoiling time!! It is just Overrated but a really good one!"
10.0,27 May 2024,"I love Vince Gilligan and I have tried to watch this series several times... but I dislike the subject matter so, even if it is the best of all time, I just don't want to watch it.

For me, the problem is that there is no one to root for. I hate every single one of the characters. They are like people I would meet in real life, and that is not a good thing. There is Walter White, teacher and loser who blames everyone and everything else and never looks at what he has. His wife Skyler who is young and hot but you can tell his marriage is over and dysfunctional. Walt, Jr. Who has cerebral palsy and is a mopey jerk. Jessie - Walt's partner is drug making who is just a useless idiot. And Walter has cancer.

For the first two seasons Walter and Jessie fail completely at breaking bad and it is boring to watch but most of that time is taken up with the dysfunctional drama of the White family. When we aren't doing that, people are being killed with gore, gore, and more gore. There is nothing to relate to.

Despite the claims that the show is well written to me there is a lot of silly filler. Such as the second season subplot regarding a plane crash. I mean... come on? It has nothing to do with anything.

Finally I just find it difficult to believe these two wouldn't be caught pretty much immediately. The main character's brother in law is a DEA agent and the main character took items from his school and this guy disappears all the time. I mean Superman has nothing on him. For the first few seasons the two main characters have no idea what they are doing.... yet, somehow, no one notices any of their many mistakes."
10.0,3 September 2022,"Breaking is a masterclass in everything.

PERFECT ACTING PLAY
PERFECT SCENARIO
PERFECT RHYTHM
PERFECT SCORE
PERFECT CAST
PERFECT CHARACTERS
DEVELOPMENT OF PERFECT CHARACTERS


This series is perfect in every way, it is surely and undeniably the best series of all time, with Arcane and Better Call Saul. This streak is only getting better minute by minute. From episodes to episodes, seasons to seasons, the mix between action, thriller, suspense, black comedy and humor is very well balanced. The show has the incredible ability to make you laugh, cry, scream in a matter of minutes and that's the great power of Breaking Bad. The characters are endearing (they all make you cry one after the other) they are developed slowly but efficiently, the story is breathtaking, and Breaking has done what several series have failed to do. To do, a successful final. If you ever have any doubts, there are not enough words to describe the visual, psychological experience that is Breaking Bad. But know that you do not see the hours pass and that you will be completely captivated by this series. I absolutely cannot say everything to avoid hiding the surprise from you, but I highly recommend it.

But nothing is perfect, Breaking Bad sometimes suffers from lengths (Like all series for that matter) and the series can suffer from some scriptwriting facilities (There are 2 or 3) but apart from that, Breaking Bad is a series which must at least be watched once in a lifetime."
10.0,29 September 2021,"Breaking Bad takes the anti-hero trope and ramps it up to a 100. Enjoy the slow build-up of an everyday man discovering that he really isn't cut out for the straight and narrow. You will love to watch a show with such good character development, and actions/reactions that make sense."
10.0,18 August 2019,If you haven't watched this TV series I would suggest you to leave everything and start watching it. Don't read reviews or see anything related to it because it will only give you spoilers. Just watch it now!!!!
10.0,17 August 2022,"One cannot sum up this show in a review. It's the best, nothing comes close. I've seen this 6 times, discovering a new detail and angle each time I watch it. Now that BCS has ended, it had given BB another dimension. I guess I'll watch it again! 😛"
10.0,1 January 2021,Great series. Worth watching. Absolute brilliant. Do not miss it.
1.0,6 May 2020,Best TV series I have ever seen. Thanks Breaking Bad team..
10.0,25 August 2022,"Even the name of the show is perfect. Great plot, great lines, great characters and the list goes on. It's incredible that any human being can come up with such an original masterpiece. It was so great it had a 6 season prequel. That's the world Vince Gilligan created. I'm really interested to find out what other worlds and characters he can create."
10.0,4 November 2015,"Talk about a television show that got people talking. I haven't met anyone that at one time or another didn't bring up this show. When I saw the CNN report of people calling 911 because of a power outage during the final episodes of Breaking Bad, I knew this show was really special. If you haven't heard of it or seen it, do yourself a favor and take a weeks' vacation and watch it. There are several seasons, so make sure that you start from the beginning and enjoy every episode. At times things might seem to be a bit cruel, but that is what this drug business is all about. When there is a large sum of money involved, a lot of people want to get their share of it. You will feel bad for some of the characters in this show and you will feel sadness for others and there will be times when you feel like standing up and screaming, but it all makes this show one of the best you will ever witness. Hope you enjoy it."
10.0,1 September 2021,Pretty good show but every character looks disgusting making it a chore to watch at times.

10.0,5 August 2021,I just watched this show and oh my god. I was jumping around cuz of how exciting this was. I dont think i'll ever get to watch something like this.
10.0,3 May 2021,"There's not much I can say about Breaking Bad that hasn't been said before. There are too many incredible moments throughout this show to list, so I won't try. All I can say is that this is a show that every adult must watch from start to finish at least once in their lives. I have seen this show around 9 times, and it has yet to get boring. The only warning I should note is that once you watch this show, all other shows, films, and stories of any kind will be judged against the standard set by Breaking Bad, and will undoubtedly fall short of its greatness. Acting, writing, cinematography -- you name it, Breaking Bad has it to the highest level I have seen."
1.0,30 July 2022,"You can watch it as many times as you want and still have goosebumps.

Is definitely one of the great series ever. If not the greatest.

If you are looking for something great from the first to the last episode, this is for you."
10.0,9 February 2020,An emotional rollercoaster making you rethink about everything important in life.
10.0,1 February 2023,"This is the only time I have ever felt compelled to make a review for anything on this website. I recently finished watching this landmark of a story for the 3rd time, and somehow it has just gotten better over the years with each rewatch. Breaking Bad is the kind of show that only comes once in a blue moon: when masterful storytelling meets perfectly casted characters and supreme attention to narrative detail, all wrapped with love and care as a gift to the viewer. I know that this story has been beaten to death with praise, and that mine is just a drop in the bucket, but I still want to thank everyone involved in creating this piece of art."
10.0,21 June 2021,"Never caught this when it was on TV, but I started binge watching it and I couldn't stop watching. It is nothing short of excellent."
10.0,18 April 2020,"1st episode of season is a banger, after that, it gets a little boring with too much talking between family members and and it felt just a drag, last two episodes were good. Season 2 and 3 are pretty good but first 4 episodes of 4th season are very boring, but the end is where you'll forget about how boring those episodes were. But till now, from my point of view it's not the best show I've ever watched. It's not even on my top 10."
10.0,18 September 2014,
10.0,13 July 2022,"Flawless. Breaking Bad has become a meme in recent times but that only goes to show the lasting legacy the show has created.

Walt never says 'goodbye' at the end of phone calls and it is by far the worst thing he has ever done."
10.0,28 June 2023,"Every aspect of a good TV show is in this series...The storyline, the directing, editing is just too marvelous! This is my Top 1 favorite TV series. Bryan Cranston IS Heisenberg!! Each episode will get you feel his character in heightening level. So much emotions. From trying to leave something to his family if he depart from his cancer to being in the wrong side of the law. Being his best at what he do and the consequences of it. Family, friends, enemies... beautiful story telling...a Master Piece in the world of television. Highly recommended to new generations of viewers around the world!!!!!!!"
10.0,20 July 2022,"Great Show, it's enjoyable every season and gets better every season, every episode is enjoyable and it's not boring at all. The show might have a few bad characters like Marie and skyler, but it's still a great show that over comes it's flaws."
1.0,2 January 2021,You have to watch this or you're absolutely not getting your place in hraven.
10.0,16 November 2021,"The character development is amazing, you clearly sees a school teacher becoming a drug lord during the show.

Secondary characters have strong charisma - for good or for evil - and there's absolutely no dead ends in the narrative."
10.0,26 April 2024,
10.0,22 May 2023,"This is the best show ever. It is the best written show of all time in my opinion. People who say seasons 1-2 were boring just watched it because of the hype. I literally enjoyed every singe episode of this show except this fly episode. And S5 is the best season ever, together with Game of Thrones S4 and maybe Prison Break S1. I've watched Breaking Bad 5 times and if u havent watched it then WATCH IT NOW! It is an absolute perfection. Season 5 will always give you goosebumps. And again and again such good and iconic moments in this TV show. In case you don't know..Breaking Bad is about a chemistry teacher who has lung cancer and he tries to leave money to his family because he is in danger. He does this by cooking meth with one of his students named Jesse Pinkman. And what happened then.. holy hell, such a good show."
10.0,13 September 2023,
10.0,17 September 2024,"I accept that it is a great show, but it's definitely not ""the best."" The reason is the narrowness of the plot and the limited number of characters. While the show has its moments of brilliance, it often feels constrained by its own storyline. I watched the show a few years ago, and at the time, I enjoyed it. However, looking back, I realize that if I had known the plot in advance, I might not have been as eager to watch it all over again. The predictability of the storyline and the lack of depth in character development make it less appealing for a second viewing.

Despite these shortcomings, I still rated the show highly out of respect for the effort and dedication that went into its creation. The production quality, acting, and direction are commendable, and it's clear that a lot of hard work was put into making the show. The visuals and special effects are top-notch, and the soundtrack adds a lot to the overall atmosphere. These elements contribute significantly to the show's appeal, even if the plot and characters leave something to be desired.

In conclusion, while the show may not be the best in terms of plot and character development, it still has a lot to offer in other areas. It's a testament to the creators' efforts and the talent of the cast and crew. For those who appreciate high production values and strong performances, the show is definitely worth watching at least once. However, for those looking for a more intricate and engaging storyline, it might not hold up as well on a second viewing."
10.0,7 October 2022,"What if ""Breaking Bad"" isn't as good as everyone thinks? Amid near universal acclaim for the show's return, one contrarian is making the case that we should all calm down.

From the beginning, Walt's cancer has been a fool's cliffhanger (what's a hangman's bluff?). If he died, the show would end. His remission comes as no supply. This makes his battle with cancer uninteresting, and borderline offensive for the emotion that the show gets out of it.

We still don't know what motivates Pinkman. The show doesn't seem to care. He has started to say it's all about the money, and yet shown no interest in spending money (or in social status), or any vacuousness (is that a word?) that would suggest he's doing this because he doesn't know what else to do or something like that. The show just can't be bothered; he's convenient as is."
10.0,15 August 2022,"The series is very above expectations, everything is wonderful in it, from directing and writing to acting, It is worth subscribing to Netflix to watch this series only, Season 5 was so amazing it's the greatest work I've ever seen."
10.0,8 April 2020,"Episode after episode, season after season, Breaking Bad continues to improve, one of the most common problems in tv shows is that it loses its essence and quality with the passage of time, GoT, Sons of Anarchy, The Walking Dead and Other shows have suffered from this problem, you can rest assured that Breaking Bad at no time becomes boring or incoherent, and this is partly thanks to the excellent script work that the series has, each episode written with total mastery, at the height of the greatest dramas in cinema and the tragedies of Shekespeare, no episode in this series will leave you indifferent, each of them maintains its own essence and does not become repetitive, the story seems to get more and more intricate and at some point the moment needs rest equivalent cumulative stress, but BrBa is so addicting that you won't be able to stop.

Breaking Bad is loaded with a drama of colossal proportions, an overwhelmingly intense story, filled with very outlandish supporting characters, as if they were written by the Coen Brothers or by Quentin Tarantino himself.

Walter White's story is made up of a rise, a fall and a transformation, really the whole series is about the transformation and change that people can experience, chemistry is like a metaphor for this, everything evolves, everything changes, shape part of a cycle that Walter explains in the pilot episode, Walter is the character that undergoes the most drastic change, Walter's change is one of the most incredible character developments written in a script, at the end of the series Walter is unrecognizable, that sweet and loving man we knew no longer exists, cancer has eaten Walter, metaphorically cancer is evil, Walter's change to an amoral man feels authentic, since the journey feels real, the situations that have endured Walter are overwhelming and have pushed him to the limit, to bring out the darkest of the character.

The rest of the characters have an equally deep and intelligent story, Jesse suffers collateral damage from the actions of his partner and throughout the story, everything seems to go from bad to worse for him, and his damage is understandable, heartbreaking and empathic.

Breaking Bad is an achievement for Tv if someone asks me what is the best movie in history, probably my answer would be 'The Godfather' if they ask me what is the best tv serie in history, probably my answer would be 'Breaking Bad 'and has that well-earned position, BrBa is a chaotic story that intertwines lives of an entire city and becomes a microcosm of chaos, a story in which everyone involved is injured in one way or another, Walter ends up being the representation of the ambition and despicable greed, although at first he shows us as a hero, by the end of the series, we can question his supposed heroism, he ends up being the villain of the story, a perversely evil and unscrupulous villain, one of the best studies As a character in history, he could even serve in film, psychology and even philosophy classes.

Breaking Bad is one of the most cinematographic tv series, each of the episodes are at the level of cinematographic productions in most of the visual artistic aspects, it has a beautiful cinematographic one that reminds us of western movies, in desert landscapes and claustrophobic settings, beautiful sunsets, poetic images and a highly intelligent visual narrative."
10.0,6 April 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a groundbreaking masterpiece that redefined television drama and continues to be celebrated for its unparalleled storytelling and unforgettable characters. At its core, the series chronicles the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, brilliantly portrayed by Bryan Cranston. Cranston's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing, as he navigates Walter's descent into darkness with nuance and complexity. Aaron Paul shines as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner-in-crime, bringing depth and vulnerability to the role. The show's writing is razor-sharp, weaving together suspense, dark humor, and moral ambiguity in a way that keeps viewers hooked from the first episode to the last. Vince Gilligan's masterful direction, coupled with stunning cinematography and a haunting score, creates a tense and immersive atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll. ""Breaking Bad"" is more than just a crime drama; it's a character study that explores the consequences of unchecked ambition and the fragility of the human psyche. With its gripping narrative, powerhouse performances, and cinematic quality, ""Breaking Bad"" stands as a towering achievement in television history and continues to be hailed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time."
10.0,21 July 2022,Just finished the last show of the series last night. Incredible. Amazing plot and characters and acting! So upset that guy shot that mother at the end. But.... Such an incredible show. I wish I had watched it much sooner!
10.0,5 August 2023,
10.0,15 April 2024,"It became one of my favorite shows. I'm still trying to understand if I love or hate Walt! It's so well done!

I'll definitely watch this again and again! It grabs you from the start till the end. And the 10 rated episode? YES! It definitely deserves it!!!!!

There's a lot of mixed feelings here, it's really a love AND hate situation! Because you can understand every single situation but that doesn't make it a fare or easy one!

It really makes you see how a bad situation can turn everything upside down and up and then down again.

It's a roller coaster of emotions and it's so so so worth it!!!

Please just watch this masterpiece! You'll surely not regret it!"
10.0,14 May 2019,"This is the best TV show I have ever seen. This is my thoughts for each season...

S1: Interesting build-up but I don't like the whole drugs and violence genre... not sure if this is my cup of tea. Walter White is an interesting character but will they be able to make him interesting enough to pull off so many seasons?

S2: Hmm it's getting interesting but also darker. Saul Goodman is a nice break from all the dark intensity. The black humour of the show is genius.

S3: Wow it's really getting interesting now, Jesse and Walt's chemistry (no pun intended) is brilliant. Gus is such a fascinating character.

S4: Brilliant! Wow, that end! And Crawl Space had the most intense ending I have ever seen. Brilliant cinematography too! I love this show. How can they possibly top this in S5?

S5 (first half): Hmm it's alright but not as good as S4. They're developing some new characters. I am definitely curious about where they will take this towards the end.

S5 (second half): WOW WOW WOW, OMG OMG OMG, WOW WOW WOW, OMG...

Walter White is the greatest character ever written!

(In hindsight, s1 was amazing too. It was like the first strokes of a painter. You appreciate their purpose more when you see the completed painting.)"
10.0,20 December 2022,"I have a deep-seated emotional resonance with the quality and ingenuity of TV and film. When the quality is good, I feel good. Where there's creativity, I feel creative. When the writing is tired and bored, I feel tired and bored. When it's dull, I feel my mind dulling. Sometimes, I have physical reactions.

When turning on an episode of Breaking Bad, or any of its extended material, there is a comfort that comes over me in knowing that I can expect a certain, consistent level of quality. This is a gritty, thrilling drama dark comedy that comforts you as you watch it with the knowledge that you will not be subject to nonsense, apathy, or mediocrity. The show will not waver, it will only expand on what it has previously tried.

This show is my sanctuary. My five season hideaway, safe from the trauma of wasted time, brain cells I will never get back, and a cultural apathy that seeps through the televised products we consume. It is straightforward passion. Quality. This is the greatest television show of all time."
10.0,18 September 2024,
10.0,25 July 2020,I have never seen a boring series like this! What a waste of time.
5.0,29 December 2022,"I can't say why, after ten years since this series came out, I decided to sit down and watch it. I just watched the last episode and I can't stop crying after what I saw. It was the most intense, real and intelligent series I've ever seen in my life. It was a masterpiece and the emotions it created to me cannot even be described in words. It's definitely the best series I've seen in my life. It was so well written that I can't digest it, the main characters acted so well, it has left me bitter, sad and happy at the same time, a nostalgia for how things were and how ended up, my God what a series this was what a creation what a masterpiece I can't believe it........"
10.0,26 April 2020,The first 3 seasons are not that good but the 4 and most importantly the fifth season are the greatest in television history
10.0,9 February 2021,"Even After 100 years, it'll be remain best in Tv series history."
10.0,31 January 2023,"Breaking bad is one of the best and my most favourite TV series of all time. It is one of the spectacular cinematic TV show that you will ever come across. If you like crime thriller drama then this series is for you.... it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about ton of different shows but breaking bad really is universally thought as one of the greatest shows of all time. Every season is brilliant as the other, while everyone knows is impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking bad absolutely pulls off! If you are one of those people who still haven't seen this amazing show then go watch this immediately....you will not be disappointed."
10.0,11 April 2020,"It just can't get any better. Neither was, is and nor will be a better TV series ever be created. I'm just speechless. There are no words to describe what the actors and writers have achieved. I just finished watching the show and I am unable to come back to my senses. The story just gets you so engrossed, you can't not think about it. It's a must watch. A large thanks to Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and all the other actors. THANK YOU !!!"
10.0,26 August 2022,"Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the greatest piece of film/television I have ever seen. There is so so much I could say about it, but it would take far too long to write it out. All I can say is just please take the time to watch this show, you will not regret it one bit."
10.0,8 June 2019,Breaking bad is an excellent TV show with an interesting plot. Selection of actors on top. I especially liked the character Waltet White. The last episode is just a masterpiece.
10.0,10 December 2019,This TV show is just awesome. It has unexpected plot twists. You won't understand how the hero gets transformed to villain. Every character has their unique part. No other show can be as amazing as it is. Not even Game of Thrones
10.0,22 June 2022,"Binge watched the entire 5 seasons in a bit more than a week. The least favorite was by far the last one.

Initially Walt is a nuanced character that simply wants to leave enough money to his family while carefully navigating the life of meth cook, trying his hardest to avoid crossing any moral lines. There is a scene in season 2 where he states his goal is 770k before he gets out, wishing that day would come sooner as he is clearly unable to stomach some of the behavious of the people he needs to work with (Tuco).

Fast forward to season 5 he is an absolute megalomaniac - basically wants to be the drug lord, orders people to be murdered, revels in his important status etc. He seemingly rationalizes all that with the consistently repeated sentence ""I'm doing it for my family"". Also, that trademark mean look he gives everyone whenever they disagree with him got old pretty quick. His endless family drama is repetitive and irratating, just found myself not caring much about it. The character simply degrades into one dimensional flatter version and that progression doesn't feel gratifying at all. You spent dozens of episodes rooting for him and he turns into that?

Personally have some gripes with other season 5 characters, namely Lydia and Todd, what do they actually add to the story other than filling time with their one note sociopathic behaviour. Why Jessi suddnly changed - WHY did he stop saying BiAtch?

You can read about the numerous positives of the show in the other reviews, unfortunately the last season is just so random and far fetched that in my opinion ruined an otherwise mostly amazing TV series."
1.0,30 August 2021,"Then I gave up.

I found it increasingly difficult to have any sympathy for the majority of characters.

Walt and Jessie were perpetuating the misery of drug abuse and the episode with the two addicts and the little boy just epitomised what they were responsible for.

Walt and his wife is just soap, and she is so annoying.

I watched all the Better Call Saul series and found this far better , overall.

Saul is a different character in BB. Even with one series left it is difficult to imagine how Jimmy from BCS can become Saul in BB.

The performances in BB are excellent, it is just the storylines which leave a bad taste. It can be intensely uncomfortable viewing and, therefore, not entertaining."
10.0,3 February 2021,Thanks to the creative mind of Vince Gilligan we watched a masterpiece
10.0,25 January 2023,
10.0,10 July 2021,"That all there is to it. It's a masterpiece. Phenomenal acting, fantastic character development, amazing writing etc. This show lived up to the hype. Breaking bad is peak fiction."
10.0,13 October 2021,"I started watching series during the covid 19 outbreak. The country-wide lockdown was the reason I started watching series. Whenever I asked for reccomendations, everybody came with so many suggestions and breaking bad, got, friends were the most suggested among them. But it took a really long time for me to just start watching this masterpiece. Everyone who loves series must have heard of breaking bad and the great Heisenberg. This is a show that made me think amd involve so much. There are not many shows were the characters are developed such wonderfully. Each episode ends in a cliffhanger, something that is very difft for many shows. In each and every episode is important for the plot. The actors Bryan Cranston, Aaron paul, Anna gunn, Dean norris all of them are just putting out their best. Tye chemistry between the actors are just brilliant. This is the first series where we can see a really innovative way to use the camera. The series is full of beautiful shots and has used colors so efficiently to tell the story. Even the characters with shortest screen time have a really good background. The show also uses teasers very efficiently. There are hints all ahead the seirs about what is hoping to happen next, which will he very difficult to notice. Beeaking bad is a must watch."
9.0,5 September 2021,"After this series, it is difficult to watch any other show. The character development of the main character is just out of human capability. The character work of most of the actors is not normal they play the roles very well. Scenario is fantastic with especially with the small details. It is numero uno."
9.0,12 May 2021,"The cinematography, the color grading,the acting, the plot and story, everything is an ART."
10.0,17 April 2020,Niether one tv show wont get even close to this one. Thank you for this masterpiece!! Watching it 3rd time
10.0,25 January 2022,"Everything was done right with this TV series.

Writing.

Characters.

Actors.

Cinematography.

Perhaps towards the end the plot gets a little bit crazy and over elaborate.

But it is still amazing, from start to end."
2.0,6 February 2020,"I watched all seasons of Breaking Bad twice. It is by far one of the most visually-stunning TV shows. The cinematography is brilliant and it features very creative choice of shots. I did not find the story very compelling, though it had some original elements. The acting was average, with few characters standing out, while others were cringy and unrelatable. Overall, decent show to binge on."
10.0,9 June 2021,"I've seen people raving about Breaking Bad wherever I go, and my family wanted to watch it so I agreed. What a bad decision.

The show has no personality, and even when it tries to it falls short because it ends up alienating the viewer and reverting to its mundane ways.

The characters were very one-dimensional, and I could not sympathise with any of them. Everyone seems to be trying to follow the 'American Dream' in their own crazy way and it fails for everyone and it's clear that it would fail so I can't commend anyone for their intelligence.

I am disappointed that they did not delve deeper into the character of Walter's son, who has a disability, because that is important representation and instead of a deep character who many can relate to and understand, he ends up having no role other than to complain about his family and appear to be a burden to them (though if the White family were my family I wouldn't stop complaining). So this was a very big missed opportunity which disappointed me very much, especially as I have personally seen many people with similar conditions campaign for positive representation.

I am in the minority of those who were not a fan of the show. Its messages are very questionable and their approaches to each character keep changing; we could have some brilliant character arcs but none occur.

I can only congratulate those who found enjoyment in this because they must have a stronger will than me, but all the seasons of the show wore me out more than the COVID lockdown."
10.0,28 March 2023,"I started this show last year. I ended up forgetting to finish it and figured it's probably a waste of time considering how long it would take to finish. Let me tell you HOW WRONG I WAS. I restarted it last week and finished it tonight. All I have to say, best show I've ever seen in my life. Each episode, the show gets better and better. And just when I begin to guess what's going to happen next, my mind always gets blown away. Between plot twists, dramatic series of events, and emotional connection to the characters, this show is nothing less than perfect. Amazing directing and all around acting as well!"
10.0,10 November 2021,"You will see yourself or part of yourself in one or more of the characters. Or a combination of characters. My dad, born 1937 is basically Mike Ehrmantraut. I'm a combination of Walt and Badger (let that sink in).

You really have to pay attention. Colors, clothes, colors of clothes, backgrounds, noises, traffic, non-manicured finger nails etc., they all have meaning.

Breaking Bad is about tenacity."
10.0,12 April 2020,The legacy of breaking bad is gonna stay for a long long time. Thnks Vince Gilligan for this masterpiece.
10.0,13 April 2020,Absolutely worth watching - I've seen the entire series 3 times and it just gets better. Amazing story arc and character development. Wish I could give it 11 stars.

10.0,18 June 2024,"Breaking Bad is an Epic show, a great comedy, some family issues that were perfectly interesting and engaging to watch the struggles of a family. And made Walter White a phenomenally brilliant character. It had 5 amazing siries, to say the least. ""Ozymandias"" is rated the highest, the high concept is great for sure, the drama and the sofisticated storyline works well. I always remember the Pizza scene, and Walter's face, I mean that was pure comedy gold. I'd give it a high score, that episode is probably my favourite in all honesty. The only negative being that the show does start out slowly. I don't think you can mark it down further then that, some storylines and tropes are used again, but they still work and the show is still nearing to perfection. I'd give Breaking Bad a solid, more then solid 9/10."

9.0,23 December 2023,"Amazing. Fantastic. Wonderful. Dramatic. Intense. Terrific. Fabulous. Tremendous. I can't come up with enough adjectives to describe how great this show is.

What's so great about it? Breaking Bad is about family. It's about craziness. It's about corruption. It's about the love of money. It's about the contradiction between our public vs private personas. It's about fear, love, hate, happiness, sadness, and indifference. It's about conflicts, children, and the monotony of suburban existence. It's about being human. Everyone can relate to something in the show. Even if somehow you can't, it hooks you from the very start.

* Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White is super fantastic. If he ever come to me and say, ""Say My name?"" I will immediately respond him back with ""Heisenberg""

* Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) his tumultuous relationship with Walter White, moral struggles, and personal tragedies contribute to making Jesse Pinkman one of the most compelling and memorable characters in Breaking Bad.

* Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman) - If I were a criminal, I would have called Saul! Damn, that guy was soo good. He deserved that Spin-off show ""Better Call Saul.""

* Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring) if silent killer had a face, it has to be him. The best in the business. He was a bad bad Guy and we all loved him.

* Anna Gunn's convincing performance as Skylar White, what else is there too say, she's one of TV's greatest b*tch characters.

Love you all 😘😘

In short, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece of television that is sure to stand the test of time. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards your investment, and it deserves a perfect 10 out of 10 rating."
10.0,19 November 2015,"This show is amazing. Honestly, anyone who is willing to invest this much time into a TV show should invest it in this show. It won't always be nice to the viewer, it won't let you breathe somehow, it will keep you waiting, it will break your heart and it will make viewers reflect on our long history of watching movies passively and criticize our neutrality. Breaking Bad is accessible to the average viewer but rewards the active watcher. The story is a Greek tragedy dressed with a modern coating, creating and slowly dehumanizing the ""protagonist"" Walter White into someone the viewer usually despises. This show is all about change and brings the audience for the ride where we visually and emotionally witness the change of Heisenberg. The cinematography is breathtaking and personal, the performances are jaw dropping and sincere and the story is a down to earth modern tragedy. Just watch it, do yourself a favor."
10.0,23 April 2019,"I finally watched BB... it is incredible. The actors, the writing/story, director... I'm speechless. Cranston is incredible, along with Paul, this duo of actors deserve every award they got, and more. Thank you Gilligan you are a genius!"
10.0,1 May 2022,"If everybody tells you to watch something you may expect too much but not in this case.

Breaking Bad is worth every rewatch and every episode is great.

Greatest show of all time."
10.0,14 April 2020,I suddenly realized that the original real inspirational drama should be to teach us these hard pressed people how to have fun in the desperation of life. Breakingbad did it. This should be my favorite drama after sixfeeunder. AMC is the guarantee of another boutique product after HBO. Bryan Cranston pushed the whole play to an unprecedented peak with his exquisite acting skills close to film making.
10.0,17 August 2022,"It's gonna be tough to ever come across a TV show that is as flawlessly written, beautifully shot, perfectly paced and edited or as superbly casted and acted. I have nothing to fault. I love it!"
10.0,24 May 2017,"My brother saw this show before me and he kept begging me to give it a chance. I only really started watching it last March. By the end of the first episode I was interested and by the end of the first season I was addicted. I would watch 6 or 7 successive episodes and only stop cause I had to get some rest before work. Of course the story telling was perfect and the idea itself would make you ask what if this happened to me, wouldn't I become Walter White. A wrong turn you take under pressure, that you just can't undo. Then one lie will take you to the second and one mistake will take you to a crime. All the other factors needed to deliver the story just came optimum. Production, directing....etc. And then there was the acting, God were these guys really acting. Bryan Cranston was so real, he made the audience empathize with a drug dealer/murderer and actually wish he would win. I really didn't know Aaron Paul that much before Broken Bad, So I just believed that he actually IS Jessie Pinkman. It was really hard for me to see him in other projects because I couldn't believe he's the same person. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte were wonderful. But I have to say that despite there relatively small roles, Bob Odenkirk and Giancarlo Esposito took the show to that unmatched territory. I just want to say, if you enjoy the art of impersonation like me, and you didn't get the chance to watch this show please do so cause it will sure satisfy you. I can easily say that this is the BEST made TV show ever made!!"
1.0,26 February 2023,"I finished this show some time ago, in 2021 but i've rewatched it 3 times in that time, vince created what is in my opinion one of the best works of fiction ever, Breaking bad manages to mix action and suspense with drama and deep character study, of course it has some weaker episodes than others and even some fillers (fly doesn't deserve The hate) But overall at least in my opinion it is the best thing to ever hit tv and one of the best works of fiction i've ever seen, vince is an absolute genius and although the prequel better call saul was slightly better in terms of writing, Breaking Bad will always hold a special place in my heart And I will always thank vince for introducing me to such a great universe."

10.0,11 March 2019,"This show has such a stirring concept. Though dark and twisted. The overall question, ""What makes a good man a bad man"", stirs up so many complex conversations that I could discuss for hours. The way it makes you think is so moving. As I watched, I found myself in the shoes of so many characters and was able to broaden my perspective on so many issues the show touched on. Thus why I am rating the show with 10/10 stars. I loved this show and if you haven't watched it yet why are you still reading this, go watch for yourself!!!"
10.0,24 January 2023,
10.0,13 July 2023,"Since I started watching this masterpiece, my brain said that there is no other TV Show like this, each chapter wraps you in the script, and gives you different touches of emotions. Each character is vital in the show, and none leaves anything to be desired. I've seen it twice already and wouldn't mind seeing it again. The affection of the producers and the delicacy of each scene are very noticeable. It is a masterpiece, excellence in its purest form. I feel grateful to see shared time with Breaking Bad, I can only applaud this great project that has amazed millions of viewers. I invite everyone who really likes movies to give it a chance and take the time to appreciate every detail and every character, and I promise you won't regret it."

10.0,27 September 2019,"Breaking Bad follows the life of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher that has been diagnosed with cancer. After learning the news he goes through a mid life crisis and breaks bad. Walter goes off the chain and starts cooking crystal meth with a former student to make money. This series is unique and original. Cranston does a perfect job portraying Walter White who progresses through the series and puts you in a pickle whether you should feel bad for this guy or not. Aaron Paul does an amazing job playing the second leading role of Jesse Pinkman and captures your attention every time he is on the screen."
10.0,13 May 2023,"This seasons only get better and better, cant believe it. Ive watched many series but this one hands down its the most addictive show ever!!! I watched the last 3 seasons in 5 days. If you haven't seen it, you actually need to, like for real. I dont recommend this tv show to people under 15 because its a very violent show, a lot of blood, weapons and killings. And of course the meth, cooking, selling, the use of crystal meth. I love the characters, you have all the types of guys in this show and some new here and then. The last episodes in a season always leaves some big cliffhanger. I got suprised many times."
1.0,26 June 2021,"This series is the best series from the drama field, there is no doubt and there is no argument about it, but in the first episodes you feel some boredom, but after episodes and seasons of this series I must take the best series because the evolution of Walter White's character is not easy From the character of a chemistry teacher to the greatest merchant of meth vitamin and contains logical and said plots, I love dramas dialogues and great characters all these things make it the best series."
9.0,1 June 2021,"I watched two seasons and kept patience that it will catch pace, but I stopped watching after season 2. Instead watch money heist, it is very much exciting and thriller."
10.0,6 January 2017,"I remember, watching BB the first time, I was emotionally messed up for at least two weeks after watching the final episode. Usually I was messed up just a week, until the next episode, so I got my shot for another week.

Now I watched BB again, 2 years later. Just finished season 5. Guess what, I feel all messed up again. This show is one of the most emotional things I ever watched on TV. And I am a pretty cold blooded Man that has not much emotions going on inside. Maybe some episodes in GoT let me feel the same way. And that's why these two are the best shows in TV history."
10.0,20 April 2024,"Dang bro this was like the best show I've ever watched, the surprising moments and the storytelling is just amazing!!! How can anyone not like this, I mean yeah s1 and s2 were kinda boring but later on the characters go through major development which turned out to be the masterpiece of s3 s4 and s5 breaking bad is so GOATED. They ended it with a great ending, and the little details lying around the plots and background of the show. I would totally recommend this show to a person who likes action, violence, and great storytelling. By far one of the greatest shows in the history of crime shows."

10.0,9 February 2022,Must watch this series this is masterpiece season 3 of this season is little boring after it makes you crazy. Must watch. For you entertainment. This series is very classical.
10.0,7 October 2023,"I just rewatched this astoundingly brilliant show from beginning to end. It is rich, deep, full of echoes and shadows, love and fear. Vince Gilligan and his people have entered the history of this art form of theirs, of ours, this video age. From poetry to the novel, to radio then TV, cinema and the computer: We humans will always tell our story. And there are so many stories, so many shows. But sometimes when watching Walt and Jesse , I feel like I'm watching the greatest story ever told. So calling Breaking Bad a ""TV show"" is a little like calling the Sistine Chapel a drywall job.

Here's something I wanted to mention--funny that I never noticed it before. You can take Ozymandias as an ending. The end, there. Of course I also like very much the last 2 episodes.

But taking Ozymandias as an ending works. It makes for a pitch dark, no-redemption finale, with zero light, morally. If your soul can stand it, try watching BB and using Ozymandias as the hard end. Good luck!"
2.0,4 May 2020,"The headline is personal, so here's nothing left for you to read about as a review but thank you for reaching the last word"
10.0,18 July 2021,The series is very slow there is nothing that will interest you in this show. Disgusting! Overrated and that's it.

10.0,30 March 2020,Half an hour ago I finished this wonderful tv show but even now I miss it. I can only say I wish I had seen it earlier.
10.0,5 June 2021,"This series is just wow. Delightful to watch this series. I bet you will so attached with this series till last that you will regret when it is finished. Excellent story line. True family man.

10.0,21 December 2020,This is the greatest TV show i ever seen. The drama is on point. The cast is unbelievable. The cliffhangers are absolutely fantastic.
8.0,5 June 2021,"Watch it when u're about to die, and die with peace...coz after this u will like no show.... that's it....i don't think there's anything else to say about this masterpiece."
10.0,20 December 2019,"THIS IS THE BEST TV SERIES I HAVE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. P.S- dont watch any season,u will be autometically additced to whole series."
1.0,26 June 2019,"I give this a 10 because in my opinion this is the best... it's hard to have a show from start to finish execute on all levels. The music, acting, cinematography, SYMBOLISM, and intensity is so infectious that I would recommend it to anyone. At times this show genuinely scared me..... it scared me because I honestly thought this might be how it is in the meth drug dealing world. Granite this is a tv show but damn....it made me feel that way and I can't help it. Vince Gilligan you are a true artist and I will give you a standing ovation for this series. Thank you so much."
10.0,7 April 2018,"80 000 000$ + for -how many doses of the poison. That is- how many addicts - who are not appearing in this kind of art expression. This tv show addresses just a tip of an iceberg of this drug abuse world that exists next door. Last year , just in Albuquerque, a mother, a meth addict, was arrested after killing her own daughter and dismembered her in a bath tub.(google it) This is really dangerous drug that destroys peoples lives and that was not shown in the series . People are watching this show , and thinking just about the money and its mysterious flow but what about the families of those who was disposed in acid ? To much killing in the show for decorative purpose and to much white lies. Someone who is a gentle father can not be a gentle father if he can kill in cold blood. One must be false. Cancer of the Planet grows in USA , and we must heal - all together, and start to see that there is no INVISIBLE, unimportant PEOPLE who do drugs and dies in films for effects, jokes, laughs etc"
10.0,17 January 2020,The better thing of breaking bad are th character. Hank's storyline is amazing and interesting and Gustavo fring is the greatest villain.
9.0,5 October 2019,"Breaking Bad is one of those TV shows where everything just miraculously falls into place. Such meticulously crafted plot with clever twists and turns that keeps the viewer engaged and thirsty for more with every passing episode. I can't remember any other show that so rigorously sticks to its core theme (which is ""Study of Change"") and yet still remains notoriously engaging and entertaining.

But this show at its core is a character study, so if you are just looking for a good time with pointless humor / action, this show isn't for you, otherwise do binge watch it ASAP, you don't know that you are missing out on an incredible show."
10.0,30 September 2021,Just finished the series for the third time and it's still as good as ever. Unforgettable.
10.0,26 January 2020,"This is by far the best TV show you could ever watch, you might think it's all about drugs (meth) but it ain't! Its so so much more, I put this off since it was released, already watched it 3 times over in the space of 2 months, Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul are two of the most incredible, under-rated actors to ever grace the acting podium. If you hate or dislike breaking bad, you aren't concentrating enough on the plot or the dialogue. 11 out of 10 from me!"
10.0,17 September 2021,Breaking bad is a cinematic masterpiece from the start to the end its perfect.
10.0,10 September 2020,"Hands down the best TV show ever. Don't even hesitate if your contemplating to watch this just go for it, trust me."
10.0,3 November 2015,"It seems pretty clichéd to say that Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever, but I just couldn't help it. I adore this show! The show is about a chemistry teacher at a high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico, named Walter White who has lung cancer and needs money to support his family for when he dies. He sees how much money the meth industry promises and he decides to cook meth with an old student of his named Jesse. Walt soon realizes that the meth industry is not a walk in the park and he faces against a lot of villains, outside conflict, and family drama at home. Not only is the premise really smart and dark, but the actors are amazing, especially Bryan Cranston as Walter White. He kills it every time and he is both evil and sympathetic at the same time. The great thing about this show is that you never know how the characters are going to get out of the situations that they are put in. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The drama is intense and filled with tension. Its not an action show, its an intense drama that has violent moments that may sometimes be kind of graphic for some viewers. Its not cringe- worthingly graphic like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, or Sons of Anarchy, but its still very effective. The episode plots are just great, and suspenseful. I can't really think of an episode that was bad or okay. There are some episodes that are kind of slow, but they are character development episodes that help advance the plot and keep the show moving forward. I will say that the first season is a little slow, but after episode 5, it picks up and gets more interesting and there are only 7 episodes in season 1. The cinematography is wonderful. This is what I am loving about TV shows that are on AMC, HBO, FX, Netflix, and Showtime; their shows look like movies. Its very cinematic and it has unforgettable moments that most Hollywood movies wish they had. Vince Gilligan is just a brilliant creator and writer who really made one of the best shows of all time. Everyone involved with this show did a fantastic job. I definitely recommend this show to whoever is interested. Its one of my favorite shows and I am glad I saw it. It gets a 10/10 from me!"
10.0,24 January 2020,"I'm adding this review after watching all 5 seasons. This is the best thing that has ever been made to watch. This is one of those shows that you're gonna remember for the rest of your life after you finish it. This might even change your taste in movies/tv shows completely and you might not like any other movie for a long time (atleast till the memory of this show starts to fade). First three seasons are just build ups, the real thrill is in 4th and 5th season. But even the first season won't leave your attention for one second."
10.0,12 August 2022,"Since my fiancé and now wife had not seen this show I had to screen it twice. Some of the Actors I know personally from living next door or going to the Award shows living in LA, each of them being authentic, believable and fascinating to watch. There have been Spin Offs (""Better Call Saul"") and copies for a reason. The guest stars are fun to watch & Cast and Crew have created something special, which draws one in. How the show got green lit is amazing, reminds me of ""Sopranos"" or ""House, M. D."". Don't want to give anything away; ""Breaking Bad"" is like a Wagnerian Masterpiece, which builds up each season and leaves you speechless. Sometimes the audience gets well shaken up when you think you have reached the travel altitude. Highly recommend this show. Enjoy & get some Popcorn ready since you don't want to miss one scene."

1.0,17 August 2019,BB is one of my best tv shows ever if it is not the best. Watch it and you will never regret
8.0,27 May 2024,"If I'm not mistaken, I've seen the series 3 times in my life, and they all reminded me as if it were the first time, I really love this series, if I had to say something I love, it's how relatable the characters are, Walter White is an adult, who has lived a normal life for a long time, but he knows what he needs to do to survive, he hates drugs and killing people, but over time he loses empathy and becomes increasingly indifferent

And about Jesse Pinkman, he's the best representative of a person who uses drugs ever, he's not a drug addict, he's just a normal teenager, whether he likes it or not, he tried college, he falls in love, he makes mistakes Because he's young, he thinks he's cool because he has a lot of money.

This story seems almost real, the characters are so human, it's the best experience of all time."
10.0,19 December 2018,"With all of the skills WW had, chemistry, business management electro mechanical he could not come up with a cure for his cancer It seems like he didn't even try.. He could have volunteered with the American Cancer Society He ruined thousands of families while trying to save his own I only rented the final season at my local library to see what the hoopla was about. I know of no one who had watched the show so I watched it with no previous judgment of the show. It is captivating in a way like watching a train fall off a trestle Since WW's partner in crime got away, there must be a sequel in the works to be called 'Breaking Worse'"
10.0,14 September 2022,"Best show I watched hands down. It is just a well crafted masterpiece that has a very balanced yet thrilling but a little bit slow paced sometimes tone. I definitely recommend to everyone to watch this. I stopped watching from season one but restarted again a year or so later, and it was definitely worthwhile. Screenplay, story and character progression can be seen to a great extent. Repeating, best show I have ever watched. Skdkdkfkfkdkfkfdjdjjfjfjfkdkdkd Skdkdkfkfkdkfkfdjdjjfjfjfkdkdkd

10.0,12 October 2021,"I just began another binge-watching session of this phenomenal program. BB contains everything; dark comedy, drama, action and much intensity - even after several viewings. Include the acting, the writing and the gritty ABQ location, and you will be very content as well as entertained.

Anyway, back to Season 2 (again)!"

10.0,29 December 2020,"The best webseries I have ever watched, especially the last season is a killer one."
10.0,23 February 2020,"After all the reviews and high ratings I was expecting a show that is better than ""The Wire"". This is an intense, back and forth drama that includes 10-15 people. An intriguing story of secrets, criminal conspiracies and betrayal. Not much more in this show. On the other hand, ""The Wire"" is a show that explains the inner workings of modern fascism in which we now live. How criminals, lawyers, politicians and businessman all cooperate to form a unified plutocratic elite that makes all the young people say: ""The game is rigged!"" Now THAT is a masterpiece, not Breaking Bad."
10.0,19 April 2021,"There's isn't one bad episode! It's perfect, the only series I can watch over and over again."
10.0,28 April 2020,"Literally the only show that only gets better and better with every season, and when you think it couldn't get any better than this....BAM it gets freaking better than before."
10.0,24 July 2023,"I can't believe it's taken me so long to get around to watching Breaking Bad ... but somehow life got in the way. I did watch a few episodes of the first season when it came out but drifted away and never went back which I can say was my loss. In 2023 I have just binge watched the entire series and I can honestly say it's the best TV series I have ever seen ... without a doubt.

Just incredible from go to whoa with a cast of villains and heroes that leaves an impression on you that lasts forever. Just magnificent ... the plot, the acting, the cinematography. It just blew me away episode after episode and I think the ending in particular, the final episode, was the best wind up to a series I have experienced. Bravo!!!"
10.0,5 May 2020,"No other series is as perfect as BB,it deserve its greatness"
10.0,23 November 2019,"Very few shows seem to capture the ramifications of life's choices like Breaking Bad, at least few do it and keep it interesting. Breaking Bad isn't some gratuitous advertisement for drug use; to the contrary. Breaking Bad tells an intriguing story with fascinating characters--many likable, and a few very unlikable--unveiling the harsh reality of what greed can do.

I think the thing I liked about this show is how the characters develop. I don't know if I've ever been so transformed in my opinion about a character as I was with Hank (and I'll leave it at that to avoid spoilers).

The blend of humor and angst this show provides is almost as perfect as Walter White's recipe for meth. Anyone who might be interested in pursuing crime as a trade will probably change their mind by the end of this show.

The series has a very few dud episodes (like the one capturing the fly), and by the last season you truly won't be able to shut it off."
10.0,21 August 2022,"One of the best shows. You can watch in on OTT. Best for bing watching with your adult family members. Keeps you glued. Not too fast paced, worth your time. Thought provoking on certain occasions, makes you wonder where the moral lies. Side with Hank or Walt? Was Walt right what he did? Why wasn't family supportive, after all they too benefited? Could there be a better Happily Lived After story?

I however complain on the ending but as they say - all good shows come to an end at some point. This one will be missed."
1.0,27 December 2020,"The greatest TV show of all time. However I didn't like 'Fly' episode much. Other than that, it's perfect. Kind of slow at sometimes but totally worth it."
10.0,6 July 2023,"This T. V show is just too notch. It has all the required elements like heartbreaking, action sequences,unbelievable scenes and characters famous dialogues. Acting is just 10/10, every actors have performed excellently. This show has the capability to connect to the audience so well. I didn't believe that it was released 15 years ago. Salute to the great Director, Vince Gilligan for Presenting this kind of show to the audience. This show starts a bit slow. It takes time to connect and explain each and every character. But after 3rd Season it increases its pace and 4th and 5th season are the main reason why this show has earned unbelievable response."

This Serie is; Drama, Small doses of fun (Mostly with characters like Hank or Saul Goodman), Uncertainity, Emotion, Cohesion and Coherence, getting the pieces of a perfect puzzle, Some erotic moments, Fun, Joy, Sadness, plot twists, very good and skilled actors and actresses, nice production, and the ending... i just say you should see it (Oviously seeing first all the previous episodoes!), this serie has everything in their perfect doses to be a very great and cohenrent show."

10.0,31 December 2022,"Breaking bad is a masterpiece.

The first 2-3 season are slow, I admit, which is why I can't give it a 10/10, I understand it's suppose to be slower, but my attention span is horrible so in my personal rating I just had to deduct a point for that.

Besides that, the show is incredible. The last 2 seasons may be the greatest seasons of television I have ever watched.

Even though I don't like the pacing of the first 2 seasons I truly understand the point of it, it really builds the base of show which allows the last couple seasons to be amazing. I have heard a lot of people watching a couple of episodes, or maybe 1 season then quitting... that is a total mistake for breaking bad. The show peaks extremely highly after the second season, stick through it.

Overall close to perfect.

Edit: Rewatched it and found the pacing perfectly fine. 10/10."
10.0,25 September 2021,Watch it! Watch it! From beginning to the end it'll keep you wanting more.

10.0,20 September 2018,"It's just bad, unrealistic, based on lucky ""heroes"" in lucky situations (too lucky). lack of imagination, no brain (except for chemical formulas). Nobody can survive in a world of drug traffickers like these ""heroes"". No one in the world of drug traffickers is so lucky. it's a deadly affair. If you want to make an interesting show, give it a touch of reality (at least a little)."
10.0,21 April 2022,"I tend to get carried away after I've watched a series and say that it's up there with the best things I've watched. Breaking Bad is different, it most definitely lives up to the hype and I just can't believe I didn't watch this sooner."
10.0,26 March 2023,"It is simply a piece of art. No other words can describe it. From the plot, to the acting, to the color schemes, this show simply just perfect. I really do recommend it. From season 1 to season 6, every episode just leads into the next, from starting the episode with the end and ending it right before that clip at the beginning, everything about it is just, impeccable. The community, the actors, everybody that takes part of it, even if it's a background character, is simply just just it. Although Skyler is sometimes annoying, I still do really love everybody in it. If you can watch it, watch it. It will truly change your perspective on things."
10.0,28 May 2019,Best drama I have ever seen!! Not normally into dramas by the time this came around but this by far is the most addictive bit of TV I have ever seen. The characters stay true to themselves all the way through the drama and the whole thing goes full circle and ties off a lot of lose ends.

10.0,12 October 2021,"Best series I ever watched. Just awesome. Love the ending and everything. Also, the baby blue song with an ending makes it just perfect. Every character is just like real. I feel so sad at the ending. Everybody should watch this series."

10.0,27 December 2021,This show is genius non liniear plot that so so entertaining to watch character development and cinematography is top tier. The writing is so incredibly good with foreshadowing and putting characters in the worst situations but just when you think it couldn't get any worse it does. This show is so creative and inovative if you have the time and Stan watch this please.
10.0,21 December 2022,"Watched this masterpiece second time couple of weeks back. I just picked a random episode to rewatch and ended up watching from the beginning. The characters, story and the cast.. man oh man!!. The experience of travelling with Bryan from normal man and becoming bad a** character 🔥. It's rare that one will take a series like this in future. Setting the benchmark of storytelling.. You'll hate watching baseless series/films after watching this. The effort and research went on to this series is what made it to evergreen series of all time. First few episodes will be boring.. Don't stop!!!!!! Keep watching, you won't regret."
10.0,3 June 2019,"I am not in danger , i am the danger.No more words..."
10.0,4 February 2016,"""Breaking Bad"" is something we rarely see these days, and there is a hunger for it – the well-done morality play. This one was brilliantly done. The show demonstrated, often in surprising ways, that actions have consequences, and how lying destroys relationships, and how deadly is the fine art of rationalizing immoral actions. Even when we didn't know where the story was going, no matter how unpredictable, it always made sense from that character's point of view – a bit like O. Henry in that regard. No need to suspend disbelief. It was literary in the quality of the writing and artistic in how it was filmed–the unusual camera points of view, taking advantage of the vivid colors of the southwest, the dark humor. The casting was perfect, the acting was perfect, the end was perfect. The last scene was one of the best I've ever seen on film, possibly the best. I watched it more than once."
10.0,14 October 2018,"Breaking Bad is perfect in every way, bar none. Casting, acting, writing, production, editing, score... I cannot point to one little thing and say ""if only they'd done this is would have been perfect."" It grabs you by every handle you have in the first few frames of episode one, and never lets go, even after the final frame of the finale. It sticks with you long after...

I have watched the entire series in order, at least 7 times. I have one complaint: nothing else comes close. And in that way, it spoiled me. The only show I daresay was as good, but way too short-lived, was Deadwood. But nothing took us on a non-stop wild ride like Breaking Bad, even without a horse.

Game Of Thrones? ""Eh, it was pretty good, but no Breaking Bad.""

And that says it all. If you haven't watched this show, start at the beginning and watch it in order. It's a manic high that you will never have again, much like that blue meth Walter White was so good at making. This show addicts you in every way, and it is one hard crash to come down off. Because once it's over, you know you will never get another hit like that.

Until you watch it again."
10.0,3 March 2019,"Never have I ever found a TV show that I have watched 5 times over and still loved every bit of it. This show is very deserving of the 9.5 overall rating, but would say it deserves even better. I don't have cable, but had stumbled upon this show on Netflix for the first time after it ultimately ended. My only disappointment was not knowing about it sooner than this. The storyline, plot and characters are some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I've never found a show that had me wanting to watch the whole series in one night.

Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul had great chemistry (no pun intended) on screen, even for being two completely different characters. There is no slip up in the plot that I could see and was completely thought through.

Every character, even the bad guys who only made a couple appearances, each had such a unique personality and purpose in the series. The main actors were so very well suited for each character and don't think this show would have been the same without them.

The foreshadowing is unlike anything I've ever seen and isn't too overdone. The attention to detail is phenomenal and really made the entire series one for the record and I think is what made it so great. Every little bit of it (from the characters to the details) served a purpose leaving nothing just randomly thrown in there as some tend to do. The actors themselves were enough to keep you glued, but add a unique plot, great attention to detail and surprising twists on top of that makes for one heck of an amazingly, beautiful TV show.

The only thing I don't understand is the negative reviews I've seen towards Anna's character Skyler. If you think of the reasons why she became so hateful towards Walt, it makes perfect sense and is a super believable reaction and change of personality for someone who finds out her husband is a meth drug Lord that constantly lies to her throughout an entirely emotional pregnancy. I think the way her character went was very fitting for the circumstances. This goes for every other character as well. Seeing them go from their original personalities that were first revealed to where the show ended makes for some of the best acting you almost think they've literally lived through it.

Also hearing that the character of Jesse was supposed to be killed off in the beginning makes me glad things went in a different direction. I can't imagine what the show would have been as Aaron Paul added just as much to the show as Cranston did. Vince Gilligan did an astounding job with this series and should be very proud.

Overall I couldn't be happier having wasted so much time watching this show over and over again and thoroughly enjoy seeing how well it's done as far as ratings and awards. If you can't tell how great it is by the fact it is still raved about today, then you're really missing out."
1.0,30 November 2016,"A very special series. No, the series is like a disdain: a very special production ... great image, great acting, one side. There is an extraordinary scenario. There is no obsession to reach every viewer. I think people who watch and love also shout. There are such powerful and universal psychological surveys that I am constantly amazed to be surprised. The level of realism is very high and sedate. No action obsessions. It is moving towards the best array feature I've ever seen. When the series is over, a person falls into a gap ... I've watched the last scenes many times, I've talked to the people watching, but the time has passed since I saw new series, but that space still stands. I understand that this directory is not going to fill any place in my eye."

10.0,11 October 2019,"Breaking bad will go down as an all-time great. in a category of its own, iconic alongside GOT, Sopranos, The Wire. Television doesnt get much better than breaking bad. rewatched the series four times, and a fifth now before El Camino (which is excellent), and it gets better every time. a true masterpiece."
10.0,1 August 2021,"I am on my second watch through of this series and cannot understand how any of the 1* reviews exist so I decided to read some. The illiteracy and terrible understanding of what the show is actually about then made me realise why. Also people that review a show after watching a few episodes, you can't have a decent opinion if you haven't given a show the chance to build. This show may not necessarily deserve 10/10 but I am rating it this high to attempt to slightly counteract the unfair 1* reviews that have been posted. Please watch through at least 1 season before making a judgement."
8.0,17 October 2021,"It's one of the best series I've ever seen. Bryan Cranston is a very good actor and has acted beautifully in the series. It is a beautiful and good story and exciting from the beginning to the end. It was addictive to watch, hopefully there will be another series like this. If you haven't watched the series yet, I definetly recommend it, you will like it!"
10.0,16 June 2023,"First and foremost, Breaking Bad's writing is exceptional. Creator Vince Gilligan and his team crafted a meticulously detailed narrative that explores the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer. The show presents a gripping character study that delves deep into the human psyche, showcasing the moral descent of Walter from a mild-mannered family man to a ruthless criminal mastermind. The writing seamlessly blends drama, dark comedy, and thrilling action, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the series.

Furthermore, the character development in Breaking Bad is second to none. Walter White, played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston, undergoes a profound transformation that is both believable and captivating. As the series progresses, we witness his gradual transformation into Heisenberg, his alter ego who is willing to do anything to achieve power and success. The supporting characters are equally well-developed, from Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), Walter's former student and partner-in-crime, to Gustavo Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito), a calculating and methodical drug lord. Each character is multi-dimensional and evolves over time, making them incredibly compelling to watch.

In addition to the outstanding writing and character development, Breaking Bad also stands out for its high production quality. The show features stunning cinematography, meticulous attention to detail, and exceptional direction. The use of color symbolism, such as the transformation of Walter's iconic green shirt, adds another layer of depth to the storytelling. The show's distinctive visual style enhances the viewing experience and creates a unique atmosphere that draws the audience in.

Breaking Bad's exploration of ethical dilemmas and the consequences of one's choices also contributes to its greatness. It poses thought-provoking questions about morality, the consequences of our actions, and the fine line between good and evil. As viewers, we are compelled to reflect on our own values and question what we would do in similar situations. This introspection and the show's ability to spark discussions and debates are a testament to its profound impact.

Lastly, Breaking Bad benefits from exceptional performances by its cast. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary, earning him critical acclaim and multiple awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman is equally compelling, and the chemistry between the two actors is palpable on screen. The ensemble cast, including Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, and Bob Odenkirk, among others, deliver outstanding performances that bring the complex characters to life.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad's status as the best television series can be attributed to its exceptional writing, remarkable character development, high production quality, thought-provoking themes, and outstanding performances. It pushed the boundaries of television storytelling and captivated audiences with its gripping narrative. Breaking Bad is a testament to the power of television as an art form and will continue to be celebrated as a masterpiece for years to come."

10.0,3 February 2021,"First time blow my mind, I rewatched recently and it was even better. Thanks."
10.0,22 April 2021,I am completely speechless. My expectations regarding what a TV series can be will never be the same. And I've just finished the 2nd season...
10.0,25 June 2023,"I don't know of a single person that watched all of breaking bad only once, it's just that good. Peak television. An articulate method of callbacks and an extremely strong plot. There's way's it keeps you absolutely glued forever. Characters are not only perfectly placed, but casted fantastically. Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul truly excelled in this, along with everyone else. A beautiful piece on family, trust, sacrifice, and the morbidity of reality. I've watched this show through numerous times, and if you haven't already I find it extremely hard to believe that you wont. It really can't get any better than this. True masterpiece. 11/10."
10.0,10 December 2021,"Y few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.

Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
10.0,14 August 2022,Man this show is amazing everyone gotta watch it its so good I've never experienced such a good thing it literally changed my life its my favorite show of all time.
1.0,26 April 2020,"This is one of those shows that is so much like the subject matter, in that it is as addictive as meth. Do NOT start watching if you have anything important to do soon because you will be compelled to binge it and there are many seasons."
10.0,15 May 2019,One of the most wonderful TV Series I've ever watched.
10.0,16 July 2019,In conclusion I'm just finna say that this is the most boring series ever existed dexter is better than this garbage
10.0,8 July 2023,
10.0,18 April 2020,I have watched a number of series. Breaking bad is above them all. After that you will never find any better tv show. I guarantee you.
10.0,4 January 2020,"Watching Walt evolve throughout the series is pretty phenomenal. Same with Jesse. I absolutely love the character development throughout this series.

The contrast amongst the characters between season 1 and 6 is black and white. The show shows in great detail how bad and selfish decisions in life can impact the lives of everyone around you. The storytelling is amazing though because in the beginning the audience can really empathize with Walt, yet by the end as he evolves the audiences perception evolves as well.

The actors, especially Bryan Cranston, deserves all the awards received throughout the runtime of this show.

Breaking Bad is a 10/10 with great rewatch ability"
10.0,16 September 2022,"First of all, loud and clear: this is a barbaric series that manages to surprise with unexpected plot twists. Not only I say it, but there is a unanimous consensus of critics who consider it one of the best series of all time. Reason: an unbeatable script that exploits the tension between the characters with the so-called pressure cooker technique. Without a doubt, one of the best episodes of the series is ""The Fly"" in which the flying insect comes to represent the obsession, pressure and paranoia of a character on the edge.

Secondly, its great virtue is that it is not an unnecessarily long series. We are tired of seeing notable series that do not know how to put an end and that end up lowering the bar of their episodes by limiting themselves to ""covering the file"". It is not the case of Breaking Bad: it is being on the crest of the wave because its creator wants it that way and that risky decision, not only must be respected, but you have to take your hat off.

The explosive mix of genres has been one of the formulas for its success: it has moments of drama, but the performers (magnificent) have also found their moments to introduce comic touches. Originality is one of the series' best calling cards: Breaking Bad is unlike anything you've seen before. And how thankful. When you start, you won't be able to stop."
10.0,26 July 2022,
10.0,9 October 2021,"It's the best series ever made together with better call Saul, people don't talk about better call Saul as much as about Breaking bad , but trust me it's equally good and maybe even better, if you watch breaking bad you have to watch better call Saul too!!"
1.0,9 February 2021,"An interesting and unusual series whose main strength is the development of the characters. An atmospheric and sometimes bizarre series with brilliantly written characters. The cast is good, and Bryan Cranston is great in the role of Walter White. The complicated, layered characters are the greatest strength of this impressive series. A fun, interesting, tense and a bit bizarre series worth watching."
10.0,5 December 2020,"I know some people say it's slow pace show but for me season 1 pacing is good because it's only 7 Episode. Then suddenly in season 2 episode gets nearly double about 13 episode where i can say that it's feels slow but worth watching. But after season 3 its like an roller coaster ride when the two characters are introduce properly (gus, Mike) no spoiler at all it's just name.

NO WORD TO SAY FURTHER JUST WATCH THE JOURNEY OF (WALTER WHITE) A CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR TO (HEISENBERG) A DRUG MAFIA"
10.0,29 August 2019,"I think people really like to see self-destructive people maybe they want to see how the other half lives, maybe it gives them a sense of being a bad ass because they like a show so disgusting, but I am seriously worried when so many people find such trash to be brilliant. I watched it, the show is grimy."
10.0,23 December 2020,"No other series has ever come close to the brilliance of BB. Mankind's portrait in the deepest shades and finest brush strokes. Just watched it the second time after years and the mastery of writing, photography and storyline has again blown my mind..."
10.0,18 December 2020,"Seriously, what should I watch now?

I've still got El Camino, Better Call Saul, but I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be easy to find out this level of series in rest of my life.

I don't rewatch no matter what it is. So.. Good bye Breaking Bad ;]"
10.0,5 August 2016,"One of the best serials i ever seen. Realistic, excellent drama. But the end can be different, in my opinion. All troubles were from Jessie Pinkman and he stay alive. I think Jessie first, who need to be killed there, not Walter. Walter was guilty only in few murders, all the rest were not good persons... At least, Creators of this work, can show us. What happens with money, which Walter leave for his family? What happens with Jessie?Anyway its been amazing work. The first episode was very good and memorable. The scenes with violence were very realistic and detailed. In the same time it was not like just a simple action movie. Inner feelings of the heroes were great, how they show their stresses,emotions."
10.0,5 August 2021,"In present, I feel like i was alive every time i watch BB.."
10.0,13 April 2020,"I'm just 15 years old and I watched the best Tv Series of all time. I don't know what happened to me but right after the last episodes I rreally fainted unconscious.

This Tv show changed me completely."
10.0,19 November 2021,The most important thing about this project is that it took its time to correctly develop characters and had the exact correct pace it needed to tell the story. I am sure the show would have been axed were it was by a different channel or producer after season 1. The most important part of it is unlike other shows that glorifies the drug makers like weeds this one actually shows what harm is being spread by the drug. Also most importantly the character intentions and guiding compass is revealed so accurately within the series. For me I watched a lot of Malcom in the middle and seeing how Brian Cranston show range here is mind blowing.
1.0,25 November 2015,
9.0,2 April 2023,"I've watched (the boys,game of thrones, peaky blinders, even better call saul,) and even more shows and yet breaking Bad is the besttt!! I just simply can't find a better show no matter what i watch

but there's one thing do not expect breaking Bad being the best show from the first episode because you may find it boring.

This show has a lot of good characters and goated acting and when i finished this show I was not able to recover for like two days of how good it is

If i ask anyone if they watch TV shows the first TV show I'll ask them if they watched it or not is breaking Bad

10/10!!

This show is a must watch."
10.0,29 December 2020,Favourite among all. Watch it if you haven't already
10.0,24 July 2021,"Never have I ever seen a show that makes every frame count and turning even the silence between the dialogue to an engaging part of the story.

10/10 A masterpiece of a show."
10.0,8 October 2021,"Before I go into detail, I want to clarify that this is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It has potentially the best resolution to a show I've seen, and the payoffs that come in the later seasons are amazing. Having said that, I have to say that it took a while to get going. I'd say that the first three and a half seasons are good, but just good. I honestly don't think there's much special about it up until then. It's a family drama centrally, and of course the whole show is, but the whole drug empire element doesn't really get majorly interesting until after that point in my opinion. The good thing about all that setup is that the payoffs that came in the second half of season 4 and then season 5 were worth the wait (just about). It's usually hard to justify such a long period of build up, but like I said the first three seasons were still good.

The writing and acting are definitely the strong points of the show. It pays such great attention to character and psychology especially, and the plot is so intricately crafted, often playing out like a game of chess. For a show about drug dealing, it's very elaborate. Walter White might be the most hatable character in TV history, and certainly has one of the most emphatic arcs. Bryan Cranston probably gave my second favourite performance I've ever seen (behind Tatiana Maslany in Orphan Black which is really nothing to be ashamed of). The soundtrack could at times be so so good, and the show also knew when not to be overbearing with it. Dialogue was also outstanding, particularly when it comes to Saul. He might just have my favourite dialogue of any character I've ever seen, it's just genius. This show did pretty much everything right and there's really not a whole lot I can criticise besides it being relatively slow to really get going.

My main point of criticism though, is the fact that I had no emotional connection to a single character in the show. It's notoriously difficult for me to connect to characters in that way so I'm taking that into consideration, but nevertheless it didn't happen. Are there even any characters that can objectively be sympathised with? Jesse, Hank, Flynn? On paper maybe, but it didn't happen for me. In my opinion there's nothing really emotional about the show. I know that it's not really trying to be, and its emphasis is more on its thriller elements, but all the same it's one of the big things I look for when I'm watching something, whether I have that emotional connection to it, and for this show I just didn't. Regardless, it's still a brilliant show and the final four episodes comprised what I consider to be probably the best climax to a show I've seen."
10.0,2 September 2014,"When I rate films or shows on IMDb I rate them on what I think they should be.

My sister got my entire family into Breaking Bad and now I'm hooked on it and I'm only 13!! I have to admit I thought this was highly over rated when I watched the first 2 or 3 episodes, but it takes time for you to get into the characters, and after I did that it was absolutely brilliant!!! I am at the end of S4 and I am extremely enjoying it. Walt/Bryan Cranston plays a PHD Chemistry teacher at a high school and teams up with former student Jesse/Aaron Paul and start to cook meth for his family to get money as he has terminal lung cancer. And that is all I can tell you to be honest!!

Breaking Bad=9/10"
10.0,22 April 2016,"There are popular TV series which have been over-hyped. Breaking Bad is definitely not one of them.

Focusing on the rise and fall of Walter White, a family man and chemistry teacher turned drug dealer, Breaking Bad is the perfect example of excellent television that only gets better season by season as the plot thickens and intensifies, with gripping story lines and twists which are impossible to predict.

At times through this show you will be shocked by the lengths to which these characters will go to achieve what they want, yet the story does not get unbelievable, as you are taken in to everything that happens and the character development is incredible.

The charcacters in this show are complex and compelling, and throughout the seasons your opinions of them are sure to be constantly changing. Bryan Cranston is at his best as Walter White, and his dynamic with Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman is one of the most interesting aspects of the show. Saul Goodman (who stars in spin off Better Call Saul) is entertaining as the shady lawyer here, and Gus Fring is a thrilling villain who is more terrifying the more his character is developed.

As I mentioned earlier, this show only gets better as it goes along, and by the fifth and final season you will not be able to stop watching. Breaking Bad is very dark at times, and the violence and drug use make it quite a mature show, but if that doesn't put you off then you are sure to be thrilled by the complexity and genius of the story.

So don't miss out, and see for yourself why Breaking Bad is popular with critics and fans alike."
10.0,22 February 2022,"I will keep this short as everyone already knows how perfect this show is.

Plot: 10/10 Acting: 11/10 (only Mr. Robot comes even close) Cinematography: 9/10 Soundtrack: 9/10

Overall: 10/10 A Masterpiece in every regard. So good most other shows can just hope to come even remotely close."
10.0,31 July 2021,"Breaking Bad is the best tv show ever maid. To day i have started a Breaking Bad maraton for second time and i can't stop love this genius, crazy and perfect maid show.

Greatings from Norway."
1.0,3 July 2021,It's a boring show. Only watch it. If you have pride issues!!
10.0,27 July 2017,"This is no strange when you find this out at the top five of the highest rated TV series of IMDb. If you go through the whole seasons of Breaking Bad, you'll definitely discover the reasons why people likes this show so much! I'm also not an exception. I was amazed by this excellent show. Though the first two seasons seemed a little bit boring to me, but from the third season I was obsessed with Breaking Bad completely!

And now I'm pretty sure, Breaking Bad is so far one of the best thriller series in the television industry."
10.0,18 February 2022,"One of the best series I have had the pleasure of watching. I loved every minute of the acting, the story line and the anticipation! Aaron Paul and Kranston have a connection like no others, and the way they feed off of one another with their character acting is a work of talent."
10.0,18 July 2023,"Breaking Bad remains one of the best TV shows amid of all time, and will certainly stay that way for years to come.

The characters in this show are understandable and endearing but you still hate what they are becoming and realise the destruction they are causing.

Everything leads into another thing and it makes it feel like you're watching someone's real life rather than a collection of parts in their life. The slow pace helps this but may lead you bored at moments and waiting for something to happen but will always have you back in by the end of each episode.

Truly A must-watch for everyone!"
10.0,25 March 2022,"Tv show ever. Full stop.

Gets better each season and end on a high.

Only negative is no other series will top it, so television peaks here.

I can never shut up when I get going about this series when I meet new people."
10.0,25 December 2020,"You can watch this movie with various ways. The scenario is perfect, directing the scenes is peak and the combination of these 2 makes it so good. The cherry on top that gives the series a 10 is the attention to detail, don't be scared to take a look at the details. The series will blow your mind."
10.0,29 December 2020,"UNDOUBTEDLY THE GREATEST EVER ,AND WILL REMAIN THE GREATEST!"
10.0,15 February 2023,
4.0,22 January 2019,"Yes that's right, Breaking Bad is the best tv show in the history of tv shows. Breaking Bad is one of the few things on IMDb that I have rated a perfect 10/10 and here's why... Walter White's transformation from a low self esteem, overqualified chemistry high school teacher to the polar opposite of that spectrum as Heisenberg (no spoilers) is honestly extraordinary and fascinating to watch. Bryan Cranston's performance as Walter White/Heisenberg is the best performance ever put to screen and his costars (Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn and etc) are also exceptional and consistent and could not be played by anyone else. What I love about Breaking Bad so much is the subtleties in the writing and acting, the metaphors are so well done and the characters are rich with complex and interesting arcs. The whole show feels very consistent, with each scene having significant purpose to the plot and with each spoken line well thought out and meaningful. One of the best things about Breaking Bad is that you can put your faith in the creators, that you can trust that they know where to take the story and how to end characters' journeys, because they do deliver superbly on every case. The directing doesn't usually stand out (bar some of the best episodes/scenes) however the writing and dialogue between the characters absolutely makes up for this, it can be extremely sad then darkly comical but then incredibly shocking, all whilst retaining cohesiveness. It has great music which enhances the montages and shocking scenes to make them more memorable and iconic. Some of the story is not always memorable however this simply increases the rewatchability of it. The biggest complaint I hear about Breaking Bad is that the first few seasons are relatively slow and uneventful compared to the rest. But my argument is this: it's 'slow' because it needs to be, there isn't as much action because Walter White is still in the early stages of his transformation (and it also makes the few action scenes even more shocking and surprising by the time they do happen). This is not to say that the show's beginning is bad by any means it merely contains more character development and relationship building aspects that become important later in the show. However it does get better and more fast paced and action packed as the seasons progress. I don't see this as a flaw, in fact I see this as a necessity for such a deep character study. We need to see how his life was before it became what it did so that it can be hard hitting and intriguing when the change does happen. This transformation needs to happen slowly and subtly for it to be effective, so that you can't look back at a single point where Walter White became Hesienberg, you can only see how every episode he becomes more malicious and manipulative. It's great how every episode builds up to a climax, every season builds up to a climax, and the show as a whole is one big cresecendo towards the last few nauseatingly shocking (in my experience anyway) and immensely satisfying final episodes. Every episode delivers, in my opinion there is not one single 'bad' episode. To conclude, Breaking Bad made me laugh, it made me cry, made my stomach churn, it made me want to scream at my television, it made me literally nauseated with tension. It's subtle, nuanced, full of metaphors and hidden meanings with plot hints. The acting, story and writing is complex, intricate and some of the best the industry has to offer (kudos to Bryan Cranston, one of the greatest actors of our generation). I have rewatched this show many times over the years, and I will continue to do so. Breaking Bad is the only TV show I have ever seen that truly deserves a 10/10 rating. I cannot even find the smallest flaw that doesn't come down to just personal preference of the viewer. If I had to give one negative about this Breaking Bad, it's that it's quite draining and depressing once you have finished the last season, which doesn't detract from the quality of the show at all. I strongly recommend that you watch this, and know that I'll be jealous that you get to experience for the first time the rollercoaster ride that is Breaking Bad"
10.0,3 August 2020,I don't understand why this has such a great rating on imdb. Very boring.
9.0,27 May 2019,"After the disappointing final season of GOTR, BB becomes the Greatest show ever made. Writers and producers were able to keep it true to the fans through out the series even in the final season. Ultimately there is nothing beyond the fans expectations.."
10.0,17 October 2021,"I have to watch the series for about 7th time to post the review. Btw this is my fav show...The story...The direction...the cast...the acting...astounding.

How could one turn a mediocre scene and turn it into a work of art was beyond my understanding.

You have to watch it to believe it. Simply Marvellous."
10.0,21 July 2021,"People are crazy. Breaking Bad is only a 9.4. It's at least a 10. Prison Break, GOT, Sherlock and True Detective all ended badly, Band of Brothers, Friends and Planet Earth II didn't have much explosive power, Better Call Saul was too slow, and Chernobyl felt like a mission to complete each episode. Only Breaking Bad stands out from all the TV shows and breaks all the bad flaws. After you watch Face Off, this show is at least a 9, after you watch Ozymandias, this show is at least a 9.5, after you watch Felina, this show is at least a 10, even take a bow. So for those of you who gave Breaking Bad a 9 or less, you should watch it again, because this is a show that you have to watch and appreciate, and it's a show that deserves to be respected."
10.0,8 October 2015,"Breaking Bad is not only the best show ever produced, it is also the only show that gets better and better with each season. The in-depth characterization, the superb acting, the witty lines, the beautiful cinematography and the captivating plot are the reasons this show is still rated #1 of all time by critics. I am happy I got to watch BB live on TV and I'm envious of those who will get to watch the show for the first time. It's so good that I was going through withdrawals after the series ended. I tried watching other shows such as The Wire, True Detective, Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos, Deadwood, House of Cards, Lost and Prison Break, but none kept my interest the way Breaking Bad did. Even Game of Thrones, my second favorite show, couldn't compare to the consistency, thoroughness and shock factor of BB. Kudos to everyone who made this show possible for us movie addicts!"
10.0,16 May 2020,Just one word speechless to sum it up...I can definitely say it is the BEST SERIES EVER MADE...just watch it and believe me you will have the same thought after you are done with the last episode...execution and climax...and everything in between is simply unmatchable....wow...amazing series...come on every creative people out there ...if you want to define content. Then Breaking bad is the answer for that
10.0,30 September 2011,"Watch it and you will be hooked. Missed the first three episodes thinking why they would use Bryan Cranston from Malcom, but I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE. BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Home BORED 1 night and AMC ran a marathon of Breaking Bad, so I thought I would check out the three episodes I missed. Ever since then, never missed an episode and been a loyal fan. One of five shows I truly love and will miss. Can not believe ending after season five. The show is truly unique and nothing will ever come close to its originality. Bryan Cranston and everyone involved with the shows deserves the up-most-respect. Will truly miss this show, but a show this great should not be dragged out, because someone or something will ruin it."
10.0,4 January 2021,"I had heard a lot of breaking bad on review sites but never really had a oppurtunity to watch it and when i did i was immediately hooked. No wonder it is rated as one of the best of all time. The writting in the series is what really keeps you hooked and season after season you dont want to stop watching.

Characters are amazing and thier graphs are really engaging... you start out supporting Walt and characters are so well built that even when you see Walt going wrong you still dont want him to lose. In a lot of ways Walt is an anti-hero and you dont mind getting behind him.

Everything about the show is first rate. It is a true gem. Have just watched it once, but i am sure i will watch it a few more times."
1.0,1 May 2021,"As someone who has watched an exorbitant amount of television, this remains one of my favorite shows of all time. I have watched it 3 times and will probably continue to do so from time to time. The writing, storytelling, and the acting are all exceptional. I have yet to come across another show in the same caliber."
8.0,3 February 2021,I don't know why people love this and so over rated this is just waste of time
10.0,6 April 2020,"The best drama series of All Time. Honestly, this should be at overall 10 and doesn't deserve 9.4 at all. If you have not watch this yet, its a lost. Please do watch it. Netflix still has this in their app."
10.0,23 August 2020,"The series starts of in a slow manner and builds up exponentially. Brilliant performances by each and every character. Amazing portrayal of different human characters and emotions. There can be only a handful of movies or series that can make you glued and make you think what will happen next, breaking bad is one of them.

One of the best. Cannot be compared with any other tv series or movie. The end makes you feel satisfied and makes you want more. Leaves you with an void. Be patient and cross the first few episodes and wait for the magic. Brilliant!

Must watch! Do not miss it!"
10.0,1 January 2021,"A true work of art, i don't know what we can give Vince Gilligan to show our appreciation to this beautiful work. Absolutely amazing."
10.0,14 December 2020,"I just finished breaking bad series for the third time, its time for review. This series is simply the greatest ever created, all of the actors are brilliant. acting is next level, the story line is next level. I guarantee you will never find anything so great as this series. No other i can give 10/10 but this i surely can best show ever created on planet earth."
10.0,27 November 2021,This is one of the best series's that's been created and has a lot to show for it. Every actor in the show delivers top tier performances and has some of the best direction in television.
10.0,6 July 2021,"I caught up late on this show...by a few years. And all this while, I was extremely careful and nervous about spoilers. Given the growing influence of social media, spoilers could've come from anywhere. Now that I've watched it, I can breathe easy.

I've rated Breaking Bad a 10. The only movie I rated a perfect 10 was ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and I never thought I would be rating anything even close to that. Although Breaking Bad is more of a 9.8 for me.

Bryan Cranston has shocked us with quality even more than the shock Hank got at the receiving end from him. The show needed two different characters in one actor with enough fluidity he could be both at times. So they approached Bryan Cranston and he nodded in the affirmative.

It is true that a masterpiece like this is a work of the people behind the cameras even more. The writers(Vince Gilligan in particular), directors, etc. But without the actors who brought those characters on paper to life, THIS was impossible. Bryan Cranston IS Walter White, Dean Norris IS Hank. Aaron Paul IS Jesse Pinkman. Anna Gunn IS Skyler. Bob Odenkirk IS Saul Goodman, who now runs a well deserving show of his own.

Every season was rich in quality. Suspense and thrill-wise, it has to be the last two seasons.

Another unique element I observed in the show was the celebration of Chemistry. I swear if I had seen this show in high school, I would have pursued Chemistry as my major in college, not for the wrong reasons of course. Walter White can sit down a young student and in minutes make him fall in love with Chemistry.

And for a show to be this perfect, its obvious there is monumental effort involved. I read about how much creative effort went behind deciding just the title of every episode. The greatest pick of course was for the greatest episode - ""Felina"".

I liked how they kept Walter White's character arc as original as it could get. He was finally becoming something he had suppressed for life - and that made him, a dying man, feel alive. Providing for family became a by-product as Heisenberg took over his personality. And when he was finally put to test by Skyler who made him choose between White and Heisenberg, Walter Hartwell White chose his family over himself, just like he'd done for fifty years.

This may perhaps be the few thriller TV shows that I will be re-watching again and again throughout my life, because it's much more than that. Thrill is just a small reactant of this beautiful final product."
10.0,13 April 2020,"Not joking!! Best show i have ever watched!!! Binged all 5 seasons and the movie El Camino in two weeks!!! After you watch this show, you won't be able to watch any other show without being disappointed. No other show compares!"
5.0,16 October 2021,"I can't even define how great this show it is not just the greatest series of all time it is the greatest form of media ever created on planet Earth. I've never seen something this good in my life it has everything action , comedy , thrill , suspense , drama , emotion I can't describe it's greatness no matter how long I talk it's just too damn perfect and people who think that the first 2 seasons are bad then remember this one thing that you have seen multiple things about this series till now and that is why you think that first 2 seasons are not good enough watch the first 2 seasons as a drama only then you will have its fullest and don't set your expectations high because high expectations is equal to disappointment . This show is just too good I don't even have words , Thank you Vince Gillian for creating this masterpiece . When the show ends and that song starts to play that scene is just greatest of all time. Nobody can match this thing called breaking bad . I am not using the word ""perfect "" in this review cause perfect is something that is flawless but great is something that has no flaws and it's just too damn good everything in this show is just straight up great .

Now , Say my name."
10.0,19 March 2019,Boring and boring and boring and i hate this serie 😌
10.0,12 October 2016,"Watching two performances that changed the future of television is really a true wonder. Breaking Bad driven by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, is some of the best television you will ever be able to find. From sitcoms in the 80's and 90's, to the terribly clichéd soap operas on today, this show is in another league of television. After being diagnosed with cancer, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) runs into an old student of his, and he gains the idea that if they cook and sell methamphetamine, he can make enough money to support his family long after he passes on (while trying to save his own life). I would not recommend this as a great television show, but as a six hour film. Each season seems like an overlong film, with great cinematography, perfect script-writing, and an electric performance by Brayn Cranston. It is arguably the best television show of all time, but I do not like to label. I love ""Breaking Bad."""
10.0,20 August 2017,Breaking bad is a show about paying teachers more money and the descent of a good man to a drug kingpin. this is one of the best shows ever created and the best show i have ever seen. you would be hurting yourself not watching this. do yourself a favour and buy this show! and after that go watch better call saul! i hear that's nearly as good! it is an absolute much watch.

10.0,10 June 2020,One of the most boring TV shows ever. I will never get the time back that I dedicated to watching all of it.
10.0,29 December 2020,Best tv show ever. Best that I've ever seen. Watch em if your haven't already
10.0,10 June 2020,Watched it like thrice and never getting bored of watching and onserving Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and all the other co stars acting.. Simply this show is amazing.
10.0,13 October 2019,Nothing else in the drama history can compare with this one. Not even Game of Thrones. Just a DAMN. 👌🏽

10.0,3 August 2022,"Went back to it in anticipation of BCS finale Was so stoked when w&j appeared together on the most recent episode. Cranston and Paul are the batnrob that the world needs today. So current still. In 50 years, it'll still be as fresh. All hail, breaking bad team !"
10.0,29 January 2022,"No show has been able to perfectly execute itself besides Breaking Bad. In my opinion, there are no mistakes when it comes to character and plot development. The writing is stellar, the acting is breathtaking, and the twists and turns gives me goosebumps. I rewatched the whole entire show after I finished it. It was THAT good. If you haven't watched the show already, what are you waiting for?!"
10.0,14 August 2020,"I think it's kind of a cliche to consider breaking bad to be the best show of this generation but the show deserves all the praise it gets. My personal favourite seasons were the last and the first season, each one of them can be argued as the perfection. Season 2 to 4 aren't bad by any metrics but if Season 2 to 4 were 9.5 out of 10, season 1 and 5 would be 9.8 and 9.9 respectively. Season 1 gets alot of flak for supposedly being too slow but I found the pacing to be absolutely perfect and it encapsuled the entire 'breaking bad' concept perfectly. The level of weight each action had in season 1 was unmatched compared to the other season (which is to be expected tbh) and man, then there's season 5. I finished it and was wondering to myself, does this season have remotely any flaws? I mean, yeah maybe alot of people didn't like the ending perhaps but I found it to be the perfect way to end. Besides, none of these are facts just my opinion so don't go all salty cuz I didn't consider your favourite show to be better than BB. Personally speaking BB isn't my favourite show but I cannot overlook the craftsmanship behind this generation defining show. Have a good day."
5.0,26 January 2022,"As far as I am concerned, Breaking Bad is the best piece of media made yet. This show is absolute perfection. So engaging. So dramatic. So emotional. Moments of fun are included. Everything is so well-balanced. The characters are amazing and it's easy for a viewer to to connect to them. It's the only show which gets progressively better:Season 1 is really great,season 2 is amazing,season 3 even more,season 4 confirms that BB is a masterpiece and Season 5 confirms that it is the best series ever. The character development is on another level. Foreshadowing too. The plot is also perfect. Cinematography is 10/10. Everything is 10/10. There are life lessons and insight messages which are passed. It is a modern-day Greek-tragedy. Walter white is a hero who turns into an anti-hero and a villain,a criminal mastermind but still has a good heart. He does ""hybris"" and gets to suffer the concequences('tisis'). He still manages to escape from his boring,meaningless life and something big. Bad but big. Something in which he is the best and he is alive. His cancer is like his Get Out of Jail Free card. In general, Walter White's and Jesse's adventure's will have you sitting on the edge of your seat during the whole series. The pacing is perfect for me. All the villains who appear are unique. Characters like Saul,Hank and Mike are incredible. What I really loved is the excellent use of soundracks, especially in the last episode, Felina. The whole show is made with attention to detail. The best show ever."
8.0,8 August 2021,"I don't know why everyone hyped this a lot , but i saw all the 5 seasons and got nothing at all.

No emotions , No exciting story , Lack of good design.

All things that i saw , was good acting ; not ANYMORE

it was so boring that i had to sleep between episodes!

What a shame for cinema that Breaking Bad is a Masterpiece for them!

Period."
10.0,30 December 2020,"Among more than 100 TV series I have watched so far, I will put breaking bad on number one on any given day for its phenomenal strory line and brilliant representations of it by the actors."
10.0,14 April 2019,"This is literally my favorite show of all time. Very bold and daring about the topics it talks about. The show is so truth to the topics and the characters they represent. A great revolving show with a simple idea but capable of hooking anyone to their seat irrespective of the genre you love. Moreover, very educative and informing."
10.0,3 February 2023,"These writers do what most television writers aren't brave enough to do: They respect the hell out of their audience. Rather than spelling everything out for us with gratuitous exposition and lazy voiceover narration, they trust and respect our intelligence enough to put shiver-inducing plot revelations into mere seconds of visuals and significant character shifts into something as simple as a cryptic laugh coupled with a reaction shot. So much has been said about this series that I won't belabor it by repeating, except to say that it deserves the praise because it earned it.

I watched the whole series when it was first on, but am just now writing a review because the quality of writing in recent shows has gone down so far that I've had to come back to appreciate the brilliance that is Breaking Bad. The Sopranos and The Wire are great, don't get me wrong, but this show Is on another level. Those shows had their ups and downs. Breaking Bad is like a work of exceptional architecture that gets better and better as it's being built, until the final finished product is revealed, and you step back in amazement and realize just how far it has come from when it first started. There will never be a character arc as astonishing as Walter White that feels so well-earned. Other show writers should study what was done in this series and what can be accomplished when you treat your audience like intelligent adults and not mindless consumers."
10.0,4 January 2016,"It's simple. I've never been so hooked up with a series in a my life. Since I watched the first episode in season 1, I couldn't stop watching it. Vince Gilligan did a fantastic work here. The written is a piece of art. The opening theme is sticky. The characters, the script, the actors, the locations, the shots... it's ALL WELL DONE! Every minute, every second is enjoyable. Want to know my truth? today I finished watching all seasons, and I can't imagine my life going on without more seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm sad, because I will miss Mr. White and Mr. Pinkman.

This is the best series in history."

10.0,13 July 2020,"I have no words for this series. It is just so damn good and easily the best thing i've ever watched, and if you have not watched it yet, you are missing out on something!"
5.0,18 April 2020,I belong to that group which left the series on Season 2 and came back to watch it. I binged watched this in a week as I couldn't take mind off the series. The writing and Bryan Cranston as Walter White/Heisenberg are beyond words. I have never seen a series like this which gets better with each season. Whatever you expect never happens which is the best thing about this show. This makes the characters natural and don't seem to follow a script. If you haven't watched this please please do.
10.0,3 April 2020,"Just saw session 4. and i hate this stupid series. i just want to see both lead characters walter white and jesse pinkman to die.. this series dont want you to feel sympathetic for lead characters, it encourages you to favor negative characters."
10.0,3 September 2020,"Breaking bad was one of the best written shows ever from character development to suspense, the first three seasons are very slow burning and great then the final half of the series goes insane with tension fire fights betrayals that all lead to an amazing unforgettable conclusion and a truly epic finale"

10.0,17 August 2017,"This show is a beautifully directed piece of art.

Amazing story and nothing repetitive as most of the shows are.

People usually watch TV shows in their free time, But I made time for this show.

No enough words can describe this, It's really sad that Game of thrones kids are giving this show low rates so game of thrones can have the best ratings :("
9.0,15 June 2021,I know that has been said by pretty much everyone that has seen this show but it's true. Breaking bad is the best because of its acting it's writing it's competent creators and writers and it's cinematography. All of these things add of to make a phenomenal show. I mean the premise alone is interesting and great i just finished it and I loved every second of the show even the fly episode. But in the end it's the best show I have ever seen and if you haven't seen it go watch it now you won't be dissatisfied.
10.0,26 December 2020,"First time a series I have watched where it's really difficult to find any flaws. Lot of messages, learnings, brilliant writing and amazing direction. Series progressively becomes more interesting in every next session. I regret why I hadn't watched it before thankfully I did now."
8.0,28 November 2015,"Those behind the genius crime series Breaking Bad does everything so well that I simply envy them for being a part of it, every one of them. This production simply stinks of the pleasure of doing good drama, in everything from creating, screen writing, directing, acting and everything else in a drama production. What fun they must have had! And if one can call this humor, has it ever been more black? I don't think I have seen any thing better made for television. Breaking Bad would have been a hit in cinemas. I saw Lars Von Triers five hour with one break movie The Kingdom, and it didn't seem long at all. Watching one whole season of Breaking Bad as a full day cinema session would have been nothing less than just brilliant."
4.0,21 August 2020,It's not just a web series it's a piece of art. A art that can't be confined to any canvas There can't be any other breaking bad

Story :10/10 Acting:9/10"
10.0,3 August 2022,
9.0,21 December 2023,"Breaking bad is the series of all time probably the best that has been made because it is the only one of the few that shows the transformation from good person to bad and from bad to good.

Good acting by actors such as Bryan Cranston,Aaron Paul and Dean Norris practically all the actors who played in breaking bad were great actors.

The story shown is to show how a good man can become bad is how it all accumulated in him the fact that he got a cancer diagnosis also changed him, or the fact that Jesse was becoming good started his transformation but because of Walter he could not fully change.

Great showing of the state of New Mexico and the city of Albuquerque.

The world of Breaking Bad is one of the better series universes very well shows how the narco business works.

The series shows us two sides of the criminals and the police, it combines beautifully In my opinion, this series is a must-see for any fan of serials and movies.

A masterpiece of world cinematography that has numerous fans."
10.0,8 June 2020,"What a show! After a long time of saying that i must start Breaking Bad, I finally finished today and am totally gutted that there's no more to watch! The story is brilliant with enough twists and turns and ""what the hell just happened!"" moments to satisfy anyone. The characters are all superbly created and written, especially Walt, who even in his darkest moments I couldn't help but route for. The acting is truly amazing with the 'chemistry' (oh dear) between Cranston and Paul being a real highlight. Its a neo-Western where the bad guys are bad and the good guys are sometimes worse, but because its so well acted, you still love them all! There is humour, sadness, violence, love and deceit all in perfectly measured doses, which all lead to the simple fact that this is one of the greatest tv shows ever made. Its a sacrilege to not have watched it, one that I've now put right and feel all the better for it. Just watch it!"
10.0,8 April 2022,It's amazing what you forget after not watching this for years. I loved the show then and now rewatching it I'm really happy that I did. This show keeps your attention and can still make you feel on edge even after seeing it the first time. I would recommend this show to anyone.
10.0,15 August 2020,Some argue that there are some other shows better than breaking bad but none of them has the consistency like Breaking Bad. The only show which gets better every season. I stull cannot get over it.
10.0,7 July 2020,"Great production, great artists, this is the thing ever i ve seen."
1.0,10 September 2020,"""Greatest show of all time"" without any doubt. Bb is beauty. This is simply the perfect show , if you are comparing anything in this world to this show then u should know that you have overrated that thing.. nothing could be better than this.. Some of the most epic episodes like ozymandiaz and felina etc.. Slow burner but perfect. I salute vince gilligan and want to thank him alot alot that he made this show.. cast is perfection. Bryan , Aaron , Anna , Bob etc. I just wanna say nothing could be better than this.. I love this show and miss it so much."
10.0,13 August 2013,"""Tread Carefully"" as the last episode was called (Season 5 Episode 09) Was probably the worst episode that could be created, I'm not sure what the director was thinking? Maybe he wanted to give us a nightmare of an episode and then blow our minds on the next. Anyhow, He downgraded my love for the show from 10 to a stable 7 with just 1 episode. There is not much I could tell you about this episode other than it was awful, Right down the drain, 50 minutes of regret, I'm lying now in my bed, feeling lonely and frustrated of how just one episode could downgrade your favorite show from number 1 to a probable number 10-15. Sincerely yours, Rémy"
10.0,17 June 2023,"There are no bad episodes in Breaking Bad. Every episode is perfect in its own way and it changed my life for the better. It has the greatest cinematography, editing, writing, acting, and story of any show ever made and is therefore perfect in every possible way. Nobody can watch Breaking Bad and not like it. Bryan Cranston gives the best acting performance of anything ever. Aaron Paul gives the second best performance in anything ever. However it is still very close to perfection. The character development and arcs in this masterpiece of media makes it better than any other piece of art. Thank you for your time."
10.0,26 November 2021,"I love it, its perfection. From all the perfect scenes to the amazing storyline. And the actors couldn't been any better! It makes you feel the emotions of every caracter, but still eonder what's goint to happen next! Higly suggest."
10.0,23 December 2016,"this review shouldn't be read! not because it contains spoilers, because it doesn't, but because you shouldn't be wasting time reading it while you could and SHOULD be watching the show! PLUS, don't risk reading reviews that contain spoilers, and why?

Its Simple! Breaking Bad is full of content, i mean every episode will be unique, rewarding and addictive but in the end, despite its epic ending, i guarantee you that you will want more! so don't even waste one second of your precious time that you could be using it on watching Breaking Bad! I watched the last episode nearly a month ago, and after that i watched a LOT of TV Shows, and none of them came even close to the fun, the interest, and the anxiety of what is coming next like the one i felt watching Breaking Bad! Then i started watching it again and i have more pleasure replaying it, than any other show i watched for the first time in my life... So other than that, the only thing i can say is that you WILL fall in love with the show, and in each episode even more, cause DAMN it gets better and better! trust me, no wonder the Emmys the Show won, and Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul made Walter White and Jesse Pinkman become Imortals! SO WHAT THE FU** ARE YOU WAITING FOR? GO WATCH IT GO GO GO!"
9.0,6 June 2021,Undoubtedly the best series ever. But dont watch it if you cant feel it🔥

10.0,25 January 2022,"I watched many TV Series like Prison Break, Money Heist, Game of Thrones.

But Breaking Bad was best. I suggest this TV Series for all Drama Lovers."
8.0,31 July 2021,It just doesn't disappoint me apart from when it decided to end to allow other shows to come out from its shadow.
10.0,30 December 2020,"Most things that I have rated a 10 on IMDb are not perfect, but I love them anyways. In the bottom of my review for these, I'll put my actual score (like a 9.5).

However, I believe that Breaking Bad is one of the most perfect pieces of art I've ever seen.

Every scene is purposeful, and every performance is masterclass.

If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, your friends are not lying to you about its quality. It's the best tv show ever made, or at least in the top 5.

Watch Breaking Bad.

10.0,9 November 2021,"The series is about a high school teacher diagnosed with cancer and realises he has nothing to leave his family when he dies. So he goes into the drug making business with a former student of his.

He slowly groes savage and power hungry as he faces other villains and makes a name for himself using his understanding of chemistry. This is a well written series with a coherent plot and gets better with every season. It also has a fulfilling conclusion that leaved me asking the right questions."
10.0,17 June 2024,"I just rate movies/ tv shows. But of course I don't want to write a review as I just want to rate them. So I'm just going to type random things.

10.0,7 December 2020,"A wonderfully acted, incredibly directed, intriguing black comedy that turns into the most riveting, meaningful, and shocking show ever made. All the character interactions are spectacular, and not a single episode is forgettable. In this show the characters are more than just people. They are the objects that represent our society, and how we react to our circumstances. The great Roger Ebert once said ""All good art is about something deeper than it admits"". This certainly describes this show. Here are my ratings for each season: Season 1- 9.25/10 Season 2- 9/10 Season 3- 9.5/10 Season 4- 10/10 Season 5- 11/10 Yes, I know 11 is not included within 10. The last season of this show just has something so electrifying, shocking, and effective about it, that it stands out from any other television show. Episodes like Ozymandias are the most haunting things ever displayed on the screen, and this is a show that will never be forgotten. Thank you Vince Gilligan, for changing my life with this show."
10.0,5 December 2020,"I don't think there's ever going to be a show like this. Ever. It's perfect, it's beautiful."
10.0,15 December 2020,"Breaking Bad is just phenomenal. After years of putting off watching the show, believing that it ""wasn't my thing"", I finally binged it from beginning till ending. Speechless. This show beautifully introduces themes of longing, ambition and power. Layered with an incredible cast and stacks of extremely well thought out characters. But that's the thing; it feels thought out. You never ever say during the entirety of the run of this show that anything feels rushed, unplanned or put in for the sake of it. Every point feels like it belongs in this story.

Bryan Cranston IS Walter White, and never before has casting in any form of media impressed me, as much as Bryan's performance as Walt. Impeccable. From the bittersweet beginning and the revelation of Walt's diagnosis, until the very end of Heisenberg's jaw-dropping finale.

I pride myself on never crying at a TV Show or Film, ever.

But I swear down to God as I watched the last three episodes together (Ozymandias, Granite State and Felina), I cried for 3 hours straight and even at some points I had to take breaks to recover. I kid you not. If anyone ever tells you to watch this show, do it. You will fall in love. You will be changed forever. Just, incredible."
1.0,24 August 2020,"Once you start watching Breaking Bad from Season 1, it will feel a bit slow but gradually as the story progresses, it becomes strongly addictive just like any drug. The USP of the show is its strong writing and execution. Kudos to Vince Gilligan for that. The way character of Walter White develops over the seasons from being a normal Chemistry Prof to Drug Lord at the end is commendable. The show creator have not provided any reset button for the protagonist to go back and being good, like in some other shows, which also makes this show unique. The protagonist has many flaws, still you will not have option but to love him because of its brilliant portrayal by Bryan Cranston. He has won 4 Emmys for playing Mr. White. The chemistry between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul, who is beyond outstanding, is lit. The other supporting actors especially the ones who play Gus Fring, Saul Goodman, Hank Schrader and Skyler White respectively have done commendable job. Season 4 where we see the cat and mouse chase between Walter White and Gus Fring is brilliantly done. The last 3 episodes, especially the third last, of Final season are one of the finest you will ever see in television history. I have rated this show just for the sake of writing review. This show is worth to preserve, keep in some museum and let the future generations to learn from it."

Who doesn't hate getting engrossed in great TV series, only to have them go 3-5 seasons longer than they should have and pass a point of diminishing returns, in terms of credible story arc and entertainment value? In other words, don't you feel almost violated when a show jumps the shark but stays on the air?

Such was NOT the case with Breaking Bad. I resisted watching it until they announced the series was concluding at the end of season 5. So, knowing I wouldn't get jerked around for another 5 years, I jumped on the band wagon, binge watched seasons 1-4 and half of season 5 just in time to catch up with real time and finish viewing the series with the rest of the world.

I was stunned and amazed at the originality, consistent world class acting from the entire diverse cast, superb writing, fantastic production values, etc. Literally every aspect of the craft of creating compelling serial television is presented at an unparalleled level.

I rarely watch movies more than once or twice in my life and I have never re-watched 5 years worth of episodes of a single TV series. However, over the holidays at the end of 2016 I binge watched the Breaking Bad series again. It was even better the 2nd time around. At the outset I wasn't sure I would make it all the way through, but there were so many big things I missed the first time, not to mention plenty of fascinating nuances I picked up on the 2nd time through. I found it even more riveting this time. I even went back and watched a few of my favorite episodes a 3rd time during my latest binge.

Breaking Bad hold up well and will for some time. I would have to put it in a tie with The Simpsons as the best TV show of all time. OK, apples and oranges, but both hold a special place in my heart and IMO, rank as great achievements in the pantheon of the history of brilliant television shows.

If you have never watched Breaking Bad I highly recommend you do so. It alone is worth the price of a Netflix subscription. If you have only watched it once, I also recommend you watch it again, and again, perhaps.

Breaking Bad is about as violent and gritty as they come, but if that doesn't dissuade you, this show is not to be missed. It also has moments of hilarity, touching emotional interplay among characters, pathos, conflict, loyalty, betrayal...I could go on, but the list would be exhausting.

By the way, if you aren't a viewer of Better Call Saul, you will doubtless be a fan of this entertaining prequel to Breaking Bad. Better Call Saul can stand on its own, but it is exponentially better if you have watched Breaking Bad. I can't wait for ""Saul's"" return. I know, I'm breaking my cardinal rule about committing to a show and risking getting drawn into a money driven Frankenstein monster existing just to capitalize on the success of the franchise. But they easily could have milked several more seasons out of Breaking Bad, so I'm throwing caution to the wind and putting my trust in Vince Gilligan and staff to find the sweet spot again. Plus, as a prequel it will eventually merge with the Breaking Bad time-line, so I think the risk is very minimal versus the reward of anticipation that has me drooling for each new episode. If anything, Better Call Saul is more likely to be too short than too long. It has already demonstrated that it is quality TV and like they say, ""leave them wanting more."" That I can live with."
10.0,25 July 2020,"This is the best thing you gonna watch, in your entire life. You won't be able to get over this show, The characters and everything. This show is absolute masterpiece."
10.0,19 August 2021,"I mean 62 episodes and 9.4/10, do you understand what it takes? You watch it than you will get it."
1.0,15 June 2020,This is the only show I'll honestly give a perfect 10 for. I've watched the whole 5 episodes 3 times and still sit in awe at the end. I don't think a series can be any better. Bryan Cranston(Walt) put on a legendary performance. Aaron Paul( Pinkman)was amazing and Anna Gunn( Skylar) is such a character.I could write a whole 10 page review about how good the show is and won't still be enough. Special thanks to the whole crew who made this possible.
10.0,11 April 2022,"Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time whether you are a drama fan or not. This show delivers absolutely everything and doesn't disappoint. There is not one flaw in this show. Even the so called ""bad guys"" are unforgettable. Personally, I have my own favorite shows that I would watch before this, but my mama didn't raise no fool. This is the #1 series of all time."
10.0,15 March 2022,
10.0,18 April 2020,"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest"
10.0,20 November 2015,"I have watched Breaking bad fully through I think 3 times now and I love it to bits! Breaking bad has very talented actors and actresses and the famous cool camera shots, that I love. Watching every character on the show develop from the beginning is amazing, also the music used in it is perfect, I listen to those songs from it all the time. I even watched Malcolm in the middle because I was so desperate to see Bryan Cranston after the finale... I watched every singe interview with Bryan Cranston, Jonathan Banks, Aaron Paul and also many other actors and actresses from the show.. I did every Breaking bad quiz I found... MAN! I even ""studied"" the different meanings behind colors and hidden symbols from the show. I was literally obsessed with Breaking bad... It is simply the best TV show to ever appear on our TV screens ever! PS. I probably sound crazy but I promise Im not, Im just a huge fan of Breaking bad. Have a nice day!"
10.0,6 June 2021,"We really are going to be talking about this show for the rest of our lives aren't we.

Breaking Bad really is something else, I never watched it in full until last year, probably for the best because there were so many cruel cliffhangers in the show, one in particular lasting for almost a year, the show really likes playing cruel games with the viewer and I like that. Something that Breaking Bad is really good at is that it made me care about the characters on a level that very few shows or movies have. There really isn't that many other shows where I would question so many variable and possible outcomes for Walt and his realationships, just how many possible ways a scenario would play out or the consequesnces of every action or how differently something would have played out. Hardly any shows would make me even care about something like that at all.

The world and characters this show has created is so layered yet believable in its setting of Albuquerque and makes you feel like you're really there with the characters. Every plot point and emotion delivered perfectly. Some people say that it is too drawn out but i think the pacing of the show and story was just right. Everything that happened or was focused upon in Breaking Bad's overall arcs and story all had a purpose and payoff for being there. Every character and situation you care about, and every following season raising the stakes and more tense and enthralling than the last. It also has probably the most emotionally explosive and intense final season in television history, but I'll let you be judge of that

Everyone should see it. Every actors performance was spot on and I hope Vince Gillian never stops writing for Film and Television."
10.0,7 August 2022,
10.0,5 August 2021,"Easily one of the greatest series ever made. The best story line, perfect casting and genius cinematography."
10.0,15 May 2019,If you are a real tv series fun than this is must watch. a WOW from the start to the end. MASTERPIECE
1.0,18 April 2020,From the first scene to the last not ever it bores you or makes you yawn or make u loom elsewhere.... One of the very few shows that relies on the story for its success rather then nudity... This is definitely once in. Lifetime show and you should not miss a chance to watch it.
10.0,26 December 2020,Hands down the best tv show of all time. It cannot get better than this. No other tv show can come close to this masterpiece.
10.0,20 October 2020,I'm not sure why this show is so popular. I tried watching it and found it totally out of the realm of believability. Perhaps people who lack life experience so they can't tell how fantastical a tale this is like the show.
10.0,17 June 2021,"It is a drama and it's a slow burn. There are shining moments but is hindered by all of the household drama. If that had all been minimized it would have been a great show. I really didn't appreciate that portion at all. We understand the wife was in disagreement due to morality but at the end of the day, the point did not have to be hammered every other episode."
9.0,6 June 2021,We thoroughly enjoyed this show. I think it very well deserves to be up there in the top tv shows of all time.
8.0,19 August 2021,"I can't believe I have only just watched this gem of a show, recommended by a friend and will be rewatched over and over. I cried in the last episode..."
10.0,25 August 2021,"I recently re-watched this and it was even better than I remembered

Bryan and Aaron are phenomenal actors who work so well together. These guys have amazing chemistry! (pun intended) The rest of the cast is great as well and they really put their all into their performances

On top of being an existing, interesting and surprisingly informative show, Breaking Bad has many well rounded characters Walter White's downfall is fascinating to follow as he turns more and more into a power-hungry drug lord and ends up destroying everything and everyone around him

Breaking Bad never fails to give me chills with its dramatic turns This show is an experience for sure. Long live Heisenberg!"
10.0,15 March 2016,"There's honestly too much to talk about when it comes to pointing out the great things about Breaking Bad, but the thing that mainly stood out, for me, were the character relationships. They were so well-defined, and I mean every one of them. You could feel respect between characters, hatred, fear and love. Of course, the one that stands out is Walt and Jesse. Never before has there been such an unpredictable, volatile and constantly shifting relationship in any sort of media.

The actors who portay them add so much to that equation, of course, from Dean Norris to RJ Mitte to the great Jonathan Banks and the stellar Anna Gunn, but there's those two performances that rise above the rest. Aaron Paul is Jesse. The childish tendencies and bitter self-loathing that Paul brings to the character, among other things, is truly impressive. But then there's Bryan Cranston. Dear God. It almost goes without saying, but his is some of the best acting ever. His transformation from hen-pecked nerd to intensely intimidating monster is just awe-inspiring.

One of the best shows to ever grace the small screen, I'm glad I finally caught it and will probably be kicking myself for the next few weeks for putting it off for so long."
10.0,16 December 2020,
1.0,29 March 2022,"Literally watched this in the span of a month. Amazing acting, amazing sound, amazing camera work, amazing characters, amazing character development, amazing season finales, amazing deaths, amazing ending, amazing everything."
10.0,11 June 2021,"Wonderful acting directing, storyline, surprises, violence, drug taking looks awful but I did feel so sorry for Walter .

Great finale , binge watched over lockdown three and we looked forward to watching it in the evenings.sometimes seven episodes per night and bed at three am ! Not ideal !!!

Will there be anything this good again ???"
10.0,11 January 2023,"I binge watched this show as part of a deal with my wife. It never interested me but a deal was a deal and I sat though the entire series.

Its okay. Not the best acting, predictable plot and not a single likable character. I wanted every one of the characters to die, all of them. There were a few really good episodes but most were mediocre. Really its one of those shows where I think a lot of people say its good because they have been pressured into saying so because their friends say its good. A Cult of Personality show.

Ironically the only likeable character was Fring and of course his ending was pretty awesome."
10.0,20 September 2015,"When I started watching the show I was excited to see Hal from Malcolm in the Middle (Bryan Cranston), as Malcolm is still my favorite comedy series. It never bores me to re-watch and that is something that makes a show amazing for me. On the other hand, I simply cannot re-watch again Breaking Bad, I can with a friend, but not alone. It's not that it's anything close to bad of whatever, it just has that strange effect of awesomeness that I cannot even begin to explain. IF I could wish to forget something, I would wish to forget Breaking Bad so that I can watch it all over again. In the beginning I did not understand whether it was a drama, comedy, thriller and by the end I still cannot determine. There are moments of everything, but in general it is just plain genius. I'm not gonna repeat the synopsis, but let me just say that once you start watching it and I'm not saying watching only 1st and 2nd episode, but give it several more you'll understand how unique is this show from every other you've seen. I guess one way to describe it is that it is now far from really and what really can happen. There also other just fantastic shows but not a lot can have everything perfect, the ending being the toughest part probably. Breaking Bad nails it brilliantly here as well. It was sad to know that this amazing show is ending, but it is sadder to see a great show just being ruined by prolonging it unnecessarily. The end of this one though, completes the whole package in an astonishing way.

One last word for the casting - Bryan, Aaron, Anna, Dean, Bob all play phenomenal job, it was like they were born for these roles and none else. If you've seen Malcolm in the Middle, you have a great treat to see the difference in Bryan's roles and how he plays them."
10.0,24 December 2020,"This TV show you can't forget , every detail studied carefully , acting is amazing , there is no mistakes , one word (great)"
10.0,11 June 2021,Breaking is Bad now I hope there's must have good on good.
10.0,7 April 2022,Just a great show ..no much words to explain how exquisite it is ....just sparkling as it is .walter white and jessie combination is just delightful.one thing about the series it shows events that are really and mostly likely to occur just hates spoilers but for those who have not watched this try to watch it.
10.0,22 February 2022,"Outside of anime I don't really watch many tv shows. The main reason for this is most popular shows is not just a few episodes long and most likely has multiple seasons with episodes being about 40 minutes long. However though I chose to watch Breaking Bad as an exception because of just how critically acclaimed it is. I have never seen a bad review of breaking bad or a review that is lower than like a 8/10 for that matter on any social platform or article. So I started to watch and I got hooked. It is one of the only shows that you can say gets better each season and the ending is just perfect. My favorite thing is the relationships between characters as from episode to episode each relationship of the main characters changes slightly. If you watch Breaking Bad you will think either two things, it's one of the greatest shows ever or it is the greatest show ever."
10.0,22 May 2019,"How you can compare Breaking Bad with Game of Thrones? Are you crazy? Game of thrones the best in fantasy world, Breaking Bad the best in crime world. Stop comparing two different TV shows! It's RIDICULOUS."
1.0,6 March 2016,"I finished watching breaking bad a few days ago and i can't stop thinking about how great it was. One of the many things i liked about this show was the character development, i really got into the main ones. Other factors making the show the best: The acting, the length of it, right amount of surprises and the final scene. There couldn't be a better ending in my opinion.

This site won't allow me to submit this review unless it contains at least 10 rows... wait a minute, i just realized that i've fulfilled that demand now... Wait another minute, it said 10 rows of text! Okey i recommend this TV show to everyone from the age of 12-99. There!"

10.0,3 August 2020,"This is the best thing, once you'll watch this it's gonna be hard for you to digest other series, you'll always feel let down. This is masterpiece. Watch it at your own risk!!!!

It's worth everything."
10.0,26 April 2020,"I've never lived for myself. I mean, choice. This life is pushed forward, there has never been a real choice. Then came cancer, and I had to choose how to deal with it. The doctors debated whether to live another year or two, as if that were the only thing that mattered. But what if I just live, if I can't work and I can't eat and I can't have sex? I don't want to be in a bed like a vegetable, and that's the last you remember of me."""

10.0,28 November 2020,"I have seen MANY shows. I didn't even want to see a show about drugs. But I kept hearing how great it was. I watched one episode while stuck in traffic. (I know..., I know... stupid).... next day I watched one more, and before you know it every waking moment I binged ALL the seasons.. and what a ride it was.. Better than GOT, Sons of Anarchy to name. Few. This is a masterpiece on so many levels. Wow.."
10.0,12 October 2020,"This show is perfect to frame level. Story, scene, pace, expressions everything. Once You watch it, don't compare other shows with it afterwards. They stand nowhere around it."
10.0,19 July 2022,"Slow pace and so many things that r there only to hit the 45 minute mark.

The show can be done in 1 season.

I know im in my own about this. But someone have the say it.

Tooo slooowww."
10.0,9 June 2020,I accept this is an awesome Series. But still 9.5/10 is over rated.
10.0,24 April 2012,"This is and will always be a great premise. Older guy who has nothing to lose starts kicking some seriously bad butt. Over the past few years there has been some really great examples of this. Gran Torino with Clint Eastwood, is for me, Clint's best work to date and will be a hard one to beat. Harry Brown with Michael Caine could be classed as the British version and is every bit as good. There is just something about watching a man maybe past his time in society come back and show everyone they are a force to be reckoned with. A man with nothing to lose is certainly a huge part of what makes up Breaking Bad.

Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who could of been so much more. The man is a chemistry genius and has had chances throughout his life to really make something of his career, but alas life got in the way. He is happily married with a 16 year old son, who has cerebral palsy but doesn't let it bother him, and a baby on the way. The premise of the show is that Walt is diagnosed with lung cancer and it may be terminal. He needs to go through chemo and radiation which his insurance will not cover. Walt needs to A) find money for the treatments and B) find a way to be able to provide for his family when he is gone. By chance, Walt stumbles upon the methamphetamine world. Producing crystal meth is basically good old fashioned chemistry, something Walt lives and breathes.

There are a few concerns for Walt. Obviously he can't tell his wife or son what he is doing. They would flip. But he has to somehow come up with stories of where the money is coming from. Also, Walts brother in law is a DEA Agent whose primary job is the fight against the methamphetamine world in which Walt has just immersed himself in. Jessie, Walts new found partner in crime, is a young junkie, dealer who doesn't know as much as Walt would of first assumed. But the major concern for Walt is his fight against himself. The fight not to become a criminal, the battle not to become bad.

Walt is played by Bryan Cranston. If you've seen Drive with Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston is his mechanic boss with a limp, who seems to always get himself in trouble with the wrong people. Cranston is ridiculously good in this and plays the role to perfection. The ups and downs, decisions and desperations he has to go through would be a mean feat for any actor. Jesse is played by Aaron Paul, who as the episodes and seasons go on, certainly equals Cranston's ability in the acting arena. Everyone in the series is very well cast and does a wonderful job in their part of the story.

Breaking Bad is very well directed but it's the writing that is so wonderfully entertaining. The series has brilliantly thought out highs and lows and the story retains a very real feel, which considering some of the occurrences is genius. There is also quite a bit of humour thrown in which at times is totally hilarious and lightens the mood ever so slightly. Watch out for Saul Goodman.

I had been told a few times by friends that this series was very good, but it took me a long time to get around to it. I picked up for first season only 3 weeks ago and have now finished all four. I have been completely engrossed in this show and over the past 3 weeks have really wanted to watch nothing else. filmnotion.com"
10.0,30 September 2013,"It normally takes me a while to figure out if I enjoy a TV program but in this case it took just the pilot to let me know that I was going to enjoy this. From start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed every episode and never felt let down by any means. It is the most well written show I have ever seen and leaves no stones left unturned. I have recommended this show to all my friends and will continue to do so, you have not experienced excellent writing, acting, directing and casting until you have experienced Breaking Bad.

Breaking Bad will always be remembered by myself and others as the greatest show there has ever been.

ALL HAIL THE KING"
10.0,23 June 2009,a couple of days ago i started watching breaking bad not my kind of show i thought but i tried it and i can't stop bryan cranston is incredible one of the greatest actors i've seen in a while even if you don't think you would like this show believe me when i say you will and not only bryan cranston but his supporting actor aaron paul who i grew up on in movies such as ''whatever it takes'' ''van wilder'' and ''big love'' he evens the playing field on this show a truly great cast and script drives this show and i'm only half way through the second season. so believe me when i say this is a show that every single episode takes you somewhere new a makes you watch every episode from start to finish.
2.0,24 March 2015,"It has been almost a year since I finished watching Breaking Bad for the first time.There are few incidents in everyone's life which make us thankful to be alive. Watching Breaking Bad was one such incident for me. Be it the absolutely marvellous Bryan Cranston as Walter White, the chemistry between Mr. White and Jesse Pinkman or the impeccable direction in almost every episode, everything was picture perfect. I am sure episodes like Ozymandias, Felina, Dead Freight and Face-off are some of the greatest hours on Television.

Breaking Bad is without a doubt the best thing I have watched on television till date. The quality of Vince Gilligan's creation is as great as the Walter White's crystal meth, completely exhilarating."
10.0,30 September 2013,
10.0,10 October 2020,Every season surpasses the previous one. Very engaging and thrilling show. One of the best.
10.0,4 October 2013,"I first stumbled onto Breaking Bad back in 2008 when it was about to be released after hearing about the show on a commercial on a local TV-channel. The plot seemed interesting enough so i benched myself in front of the TV casually watching the first episode, and i'll admit it, after watching the first two episodes i was hooked.

The plot appeals to me since i greatly enjoy crime/drama, especially with suspense. However, what i never could have imagined (and probably not Vince Gilligan neither) was how big this show has gotten and what it has grown into. I followed it from start to finish and over the course of these five years the drama has increased tenfolds, amassed an enormous viewer base and it's now nominated for one of the best written TV-series ever, and i honestly agree.

Breaking Bad's style is subtle yet refined which leaves little hints allowing the viewer to guess what next, but guess what? Breaking Bad never ceases to surprises you despite your best efforts in trying to guess what's next. The drama is so intense all through the series you never seem to lose touch of interest and the show delivers it all with amazing suspense.

The overall acting is excellent and lead actor Bryan Cranston delivers an exceptional performance making the main character Walter White into an icon.

The only problem i see with these types of series is that the re-watch ability is low because the series build upon not knowing what's going to happen next.

Of course as all good things have to come to an end or as we would say in Breaking Bad's terms ""all bad things have to come to an end"" this show ended with one of the most epic endings in history of TV, if not perhaps even the most epic. I have a desire of wanting the series to continue but in reality i really don't want this to happen.

I don't know if i'm just bias because i tend to enjoy this type of suspending crime/drama series... or overrating it because i'm filled with emotions from recently having watched the finale, but this is the best show i have ever watched in the history of television, and with its perfected ending this is a series for the history books.

With great gratitude to Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and everyone else involved for giving us this masterpiece i'll gladly give this a 10/10."
10.0,21 June 2022,"Overhyped show, Painfully slow and repetitive at times.

You can easily watch first season and the last season without missing much.

The biggest positive for me was because of breaking bad I found better call Saul, which is much more gripping and intense."
10.0,29 September 2013,"Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, the best TV drama ever made. There have been a few I've missed, but from everything I've ever watched, there has never been anything more complete than this series. It is simply something not to be missed.

The acting, writing, directing, producing, everything is the best I've ever seen. There is rarely, in all 5 seasons, a dull moment, and there has never been anything like it. I've never, ever given an '10' to a TV show before, but nothing has ever deserved it until this.

It's not for kids. If it had a rating, it would be at least a PG-13, if not R. If you are going to let teens watch, make sure they watch until the end of the series, because the beginning might make it seem 'cool' to be making and doing meth. It's not until the end of the last season that you see things come full circle.

There is no point in going over every season or episode because you need to watch them all anyway. But I will state that it is rare that one program has this much talent, and to watch the main characters slowly morph into something completely different than they were is magical.

All the people involved, especially Vince Gilligan, deserve every award they receive and every paycheck they earn, if not more. The show is brilliant and for the first time ever, I'm actually going to be sad a series is over. They will be missed in my house."

10.0,15 May 2021,"I don't get all the 1/10 reviews for this incredibly written show as if the reviewers just hated it for getting 9.4/10. Its certainly not 1/10 and definitely 10/10. The character development is believable, and for the perfect character development, its undestandable why the 1st 2 seasons are slow.

Anyway, give it a try with patience, something awesome is waiting for you!"
10.0,24 May 2020,What more can I say than ... why did this show have to stop ? By far the best show on Netflix. I just couldn't get enough of the show. If you're looking for something to watch then look no future.

10.0,9 June 2020,
10.0,2 August 2020,"It is literally the best Tv series ever and you have probably heard that a dozen of times. But it really is. One of the major mistakes of other tv shows is the ending, which here is great, ending with the episode Felina, a great closure to a historical series.Definitely a must-watch."
10.0,3 October 2022,"One of the , unfortunately , rare decent shows out there !!! From my point of view , it is not 10 stars for me , as I prefer a little more violence and less family drama ))) Nevertheless It is , for , sure , deserves the prime spot in anybody's collection of the best and better TV shows of all times !!!Also , I find , that this one being so cool , could have couple more seasons)))

Also , this 600 characters nonsense is really starts to aggravate me ... To write something just to fill up the space is not my idea of a decent , informative review , just useless collection of words ... wish it would change.."

10.0,29 October 2013,"The ONLY thing that disappoints me about this show is that I can't watch it again for the first time, so I am truly envious of anyone who hasn't seen it. The excitement that washes over you when watching this show for the first time is hard to describe. It is just amazing in every way, the filming, the scenes, the music, the storyline and of course the acting was AMAZING! And not just 1 actor in particular, I mean of course Bryan Cranston was superb, and Aaron Paul alike but ALL of the actors were great and they all made you love them in a different way. There is not a single minute of this show wasted with pointless storyline. Every single minute of all the 62 episodes keeps you entranced and wanting more. Even the slow areas have a significant story to tell and these moments are usually related to something that will happen later in the show. This is by far the best series I have EVER seen, if you haven't seen it please give it a chance, but be prepared to do nothing but watch breaking bad for the next 3 weeks because you literally won't be able to do anything else."
10.0,6 June 2020,"Everyone's been telling me to get into Breaking Bad, and finally had time (lots) to see Series 1. If you've not seen BB before prepare yourself for something amazingly unexpected. It's very disturbing from the human angle that death is always just round the corner. But the plot neatly sidesteps this as a minor inconvenience to give us a wonderful characterization a middle-aged man, still with choices in life, when others would've dismissed him as a no-hoper."
1.0,16 May 2021,BrBa and The Sopranos are probably the greatest shows to ever air on television. We are blessed!
10.0,28 October 2011,"Dear team of Breaking Bad, if you read this, tell everybody that I am sorry that I rated only with 10 , but IMDb vote drop-down menu has only ten stars.There should be added few more for this serial.Plot is full of turnovers, acting is magnificent, and I just cant wait next season.

To be clear, I am not trying to pretend that I am movie expert, or critic, and this is my first review ever, but I simply felt that I must share my emotions with whole world.From acting to music, everything is so perfect, that I couldn't understand, why, why this team didn't get Nobel prize for movie chemistry. Not, TV, I am talking about movie chemistry. This is pure art for me. I can not write on English what I feel on Serbian, but those words are common: respect, continue, love. P.S. Now, I have one more wish in my life, to meet acting team from B.B. to pay them personal respect.

10.0,2 September 2010,"Breaking Bad is a work of genius - I realize that is a word thrown around somewhat haphazardly at times, but this show truly is brilliant in my view. The cinematography is beautiful and often ingenuous, the acting fantastic, the storyline and subplots enthralling and the soundtrack cleverly chosen to the point where it becomes an integral, organic part of the show. As an example, David Costabile's (Gale) singing with the record player as he attends his domestic duties is delightfully integrated - a scene I happily admit to have watched and listened to several times.

It has been said a lot (and duly acknowledged by awards) already how great the acting is in this show, but it won't hurt to say it again: Bryan Cranston is a joy to watch as Walter White, whose increasingly polar double life is mesmerizing to follow as it evolves throughout the series. Aaron Paul is also spectacular as Jesse Pinkman and complements Walter White in a way that approaches yin-and-yang like qualities. Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, RJ Mitte and Betsy Brandt are also truly praiseworthy; Dean Norris' part as Hank Schrader gives a particularly stunning performance in my view as he develops into a complex and vulnerable character who feels the need to hide his increasing frustration and sense of alienation from his wife and colleagues. A great actor. Giancarlo Esposito, another actor well worth mentioning, is perfect as the enigmatic Gus.

This is a show that works on is own terms - it is brave (lung cancer, rampant drug abuse, methamphetamine manufacture and distribution - hardly easy content to pitch at any network) and balances perfectly between the darkly sinister and the absurdly comical in my opinion. It is a show that grows with every episode.

Highly recommended!"

I seriously gave this a chance and watched all seasons and after each episode i was paining myself to see the next one. Not even once was i like ''oh i wanna see another''.. more like ''omg still so many epsiodes left of this season''..

I find the show average 5/10. If i find a show good i would wanna rewatch it again sometime. Neverever this show."
9.0,30 September 2013,"Yes. A Masterpiece. The full essence of the human condition and the opening of the Dark Door that lies in all of us. What would we do? How far do we go doing what we think it's the right thing even when everything starts to fall apart? Can we keep our goals or will we always want more and more? Can we stop? Can we give up? What will we do to protect the ones we love from the pain and suffering we caused them? Was it worth it?

This is the show. If you haven't watched it yet PLEASE DO and don't give up on it. Each episode is perfectly made and the Ending well... for me it was the best ending ever of a TV Show, you will not be disappointed and when you finish watching it you'll just stand up and scream not knowing if crying of happiness or sadness..

""If that's true and you don't know who I am... then maybe, your best course would be to... tread lightly"" - Walter White"
10.0,7 October 2013,"I have never seen a show so dark, so violent, so brutally realistic and become so invested that I can't get enough of it. Nothing like this. Screw Malcolm in the Middle, this is Brian Cranston's true performance of a lifetime. He delivered such emotion worth receiving a dozen Oscars. And his transformation really is unbelievably stunning swinging from nerdy chemistry teacher to daring and threatening criminal, but he still sympathetic and human. A lot of us may disagree with some of the choices he makes as the world's greatest meth cook but at least we understand why he's doing it, which makes us think to ourselves: what would you do if you had no money to support your family and you have no medical insurance for your lung cancer, which is what he's got? What choice would you be making in situations like this? I think that's the moral of this story: consequences, sacrifices, and most of all 'choice'. It makes you think of what path to take to support your family if there were no other alternatives. I think about a lot.

Everything works: the story, the tone, the timing, the casting, and the chief of it's success, the acting. Not once does it feel like somebody's winking at the camera, everybody is firmly focused. It's a great show with a great lesson: choice."
10.0,6 February 2014,"This is my first review about any thing and i couldn't be more grateful that it's about breaking bad . it's without a doubt the best thing that ever happened on TV . the leading actor Bryan Cranston is in my own opinion one of the best actors in Hollywood right now .this guy will make you experience a roller coaster of emotions through the whole show .the entire cast is just amazing and each of the characters are perfectly developed and written .the thing about TV shows that i don't like is that sometimes they sort of lose track at the end it's like their curve is going up and down through the seasons well i can assure you that you will not see this on breaking bad ,this show will just keep rising and rising till the last second of it .breaking bad is a must see phenomena . from the first season it's an addiction and you can't stop watching it . don't hesitate for a second to start it right now ."
10.0,30 September 2013,"I've never been so addicted by a TV American drama series like Breaking Bad. This was an all new experience that I started the past year and finished some minutes ago. This was something that many of my friends had experienced with some shows that fascinated their minds, but were always not so interesting for me. I am more a guy of movies, but Breaking Bad caught me by surprise, and changed my entire life. I never saw anything like this and, I presume, I will not see, from now on, anything that could be so good as Breaking Bad. I'm so grateful to the genius Vince Gilligan, who created a story and characters that are so human (and that is what people most like to see on TV, that's for sure) and to the great actors and technicians that made this ""magnum opus"" be possible. Thanks to Breaking Bad, I changed my way about drama fiction in American television business, and it make me belief that, despite the economic interests of the guys who just want to know about the damn ratings, there is always space in networks for works that are made with intelligence. Because is shows like Breaking Bad that make that history, the History of Television and the History of the creativity of the humankind and the imagination. imagination that has to be seen as an important factor for the creation of great art. Yes, because Breaking Bad is art, from beginning to end. THANK YOU GUYS!

From a great Portuguese fan, Rui."

10.0,20 September 2020,I saw this show many times. You must watch it. Walter is the best
10.0,14 June 2010,The show focuses on Walter White a guy who could afford a much nicer car than the one he drives. He could afford this because he's a successful drug manufacturer. At first he begins this dangerous career to make money to pay for cancer treatment. However somewhere along the way the writers began to lean away from the whole cancer issue. It seems to have disappeared as cases of terminal cancer so often do in reality. Along with the less than desirable vehicle Walt drives is his less than desirable harlot of a wife Skylar. This dried out old box has brought Walter down from one high after another during the course of this unfortunate program. Walt's one friend seems to be a meth addled degenerate wigger named Jesse. In short we have the tale of a guy with way too much money to have such a whore of a wife and a retarded best friend. Bob Odenkirk is awesome in this.
10.0,16 August 2013,"Compared to the other great TV shows, Breaking Bad is spare and stripped-down. The creator seems to have taken a very basic literary form -- the classical tragedy in five acts -- and set out to expose the self-destructive hubris at the heart of one of the greatest TV characters of all time. Walter White is the White Whale to Hank, and Lear to himself. I don't actually know how it's going to end, but it plays with the foreknowledge of tragedy we have in our gut (those flash- forwards are a particularly good way of evoking this feeling). Contrast it with, say, The Killing, where absolutely nothing was predictable, which left viewers feeling played with. Maybe we actually like shows that have some element of predictability.

It's easy to see just how completely this show breaks the TV mold by slicing away the other genres that have both enriched and bloated pop entertainment: soap opera, novelistic realism, black comedy. For all its greatness, The Sopranos was bloated with soapy elements; The Wire, greater still, was committed to a certain kind of naturalism; Weeds always had the complex tone associated with black comedy, and (completely failing to sustain that complexity) eventually degenerated into a sitcom. You don't get any of this with Breaking Bad: there are just a few larger-than-life characters (no wasted ones, really), and a pretty small universe. It mostly looks like it's been made on a post- recession shoestring budget (at least compared to AMC's inferior costume drama Mad Men). It is brilliantly acted and directed."
10.0,17 December 2013,"Quite recently I have heard / read about this series critically acclaimed success from friends and newspapers. Therefore I've started watching all 62 episodes within a week in long night sessions. This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better! Let me honestly say I've got addicted a few seconds after i've started with the pilot episode. This wasn't a series for me anymore but also a long thrilling movie I couldn't turned off. Perfect story, plots, characters, actors and actresses, filming locations, ... The story is brutal and comedic at the same time. The soundtrack rocks! Creator Vince Gilligan is truly a genius!

BREAKING BAD will set the high standard for a long, long time."

10.0,4 January 2014,"Seriously, no joke. This is THE greatest show of all time. There is a reason why your friends are always preaching this show as the second coming of Jesus Christ. Not only do ALL characters get development but the story literally had me reacting. Normally i'm watching a show like a potato but THIS show literally had my fist in my mouth at one point, I almost fell out of my chair out of suspense.

Seriously watch the first 5 episodes, you will be hooked. My favorite series of all time. Better than Game Of Thrones, Dexter, The Wire,Sopranos EVERYTHING! Well for me anyway. If you love a good crime thriller this is the show for you. Hope you enjoy!"
10.0,8 October 2013,"This show is a true work of art...

The story, the acting, the drama, the irony, the poetic moments, the subtleties, the way it is directed... Everything! It's very hard to find flaws in a show like this, when all these elements unite in a single, beautiful masterpiece.

If you haven't watched it yet, watch it! You will laugh, you will cry, you will enjoy a story full of surprising twists, meaningful subtleties, suspense, drama, tragedy, poetry, and a brilliant ending, with absolutely no loose ends.

This show must be watched and re-watched. It undoubtedly deserves the ranking 10."
1.0,8 March 2010,"if you haven't yet watched Breaking Bad, you are missing out on the best writing, acting, pushing-the-envelope, gripping, thrilling drama out there in t.v. land. absolutely superb and shocking. i'm so proud of amc for taking a chance on this show. the second season was even better than the first and that's a tough nut to crack. i was a bit taken aback in reading the IMDb summary statement on this show - i don't find the main character to be in a ""mid-life crisis"" but rather a life & death crisis of provision for his family. i find him innately unselfish which is in complete opposition to a mid-life crisis. not the greatest job in summary of such a stellar piece of narrative genius.

i won't spoil further other than to say...get on itunes and rent seasons 1 & 2 soon! season 3 starts in just 2 weeks!!!"

10.0,10 January 2016,"Absolutely amazing show. If you're one of the seven people that haven't yet seen this show, let's make that number go down to six. People frequently talk about the decline of television, ""Back in my day, we had good shows I Love Lucy, now there's only Jersey Shore and American Idol."" This show cancels out any garbage ""reality"" shows that are on TV right now. Many consider this show to be another anti-hero show, and I'd have to disagree. Without spoiling anything, the main character of this show, Walter White, has very little redeemable qualities by the end of the final season. While this is listed as Drama, this show is not some boring cop procedural, it can be viewed as a (very) Dark Comedy if you want it to be. Only Game of Thrones has achieved as much adoration since Breaking Bad, and I love GoT, but this is just better."
10.0,8 June 2015,"How could I give less then 10 to one of the best TV series of all time??? Breaking Bad surely is already recognized as a masterpiece and one show that will be remembered for a long time. Having a story so original and so bold that is very hard to not like it watching just one episode. The high number of nominations and awards received by the show is just a glimpse of what this series has represented so far.

With a production and direction so good in creating an environment to the show be forged, the performance of the cast in the creation and development of the characters, even those who become relevant in future seasons, are made in a such extraordinary way. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul do an outstanding performance, presenting us with two characters that already have become iconic and memorable in people's mind.

The only bad aspect of the series is that is already over. Of course I would like to have more episodes, but the way which the show were built until the season finale was perfect."
9.0,14 September 2013,"I won't get into the debate about ""best"" show ever, b/c there's no such thing, but it's certainly my FAVORITE show ever, and everything in it is perfect for my sensibilities. Cranston as Walt is manic and focused at the same time. Jesse Pinkman's a reasonable yet amoral character, drifting through life complaining about the things he himself is the cause of. Directing is top notch consistently while you can still spot the stylistic differences of various people behind the camera, and the variety of villains is each given their own aesthetic. The most under- appreciated part of that aesthetic IMO is the color choice, harsh reds and yellows and a hideous New Mexico bleak background.

Simply put I love everything about this show, enough that I even made this art for it with my favorite quotes.

10.0,12 December 2016,"Brilliant screenplay, out-of-the world acting, genius direction, and mesmerizing camera-work combines together to make the greatest show on TV ever - BREAKING BAD. If there were a fair way to compare TV with movies, BB could have rated above the all time best movies.

The series starts of slowly, and in the first few episodes of season 1,it may just seem like a story of a jerk facing some serious mid-life crisis. Then the season got hit by writers strike and season 1 ended quickly.But once we are into the Season 2 Episode 1, it goes on to a different level altogether, and it simply keeps getting better and better right till the end of Season 5. I had the privilege of watching BB after the end of season 5, so I simply watched all the episodes back to back from start to finish. It was so very engaging, that if I had to wait a week for the next episode the suspense could have killed me.

The only other series that engaged me so much are Game of Thrones and Westworld. But the difference lies in the fact that GoT and WW engages the viewers somewhat by shocking them with the violence and sex, but BB only uses the acting and excellent writing to engage us. This makes BB much more realistic. I enjoyed a lot watching GoT and WW, but I'll never forget the impact BB made on me."

10.0,1 June 2013,"After watching the eighth episode of Season 5, I can say for certain that Breaking Bad is the best show on television till now. Being in India, you hardly get to watch these sort of TV shows amidst our traditional flagrant family dramas with absolutely nothing to offer. This is by far the most realistic show I've ever witnessed. Bryan Cranston is amazing in the character of Walter White. He continues to impress with his acting, his shady parley and his performance in the black comedy scenes.

This is the story of Mr. White, an inventive chemistry professor who endures cancer and eventually teams up with Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to launch the purest Crystal Meth in the market. His journey transforms him from a modest human being into a menacing individual who will stop at nothing to provide a better life for his family and keeping his disguise intact with his in-laws and the rest of the world as a modest and humble being who is fighting cancer. Although he succeeds with almost everyone, his wife eventually finds out and his family gets secluded from him. But he stops at nothing to fulfill his dream of building an empire of his own which leads him to accomplish even more perilous deeds. The important message that this show conveys that no matter how hard you try to suppress a rogue endeavor, the truth will ultimately reveal itself in the long run.

This is an amazing achievement in TV history. All other actors including Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito and Jonathan Banks gives stand out performances. This is not a show for everybody though. It is mature and perfected for grown-ups but it is not to be missed under any circumstances. All I can say to the producers of this show is - Thank you & Keep 'em coming.

A must see. 10/10."
10.0,30 April 2016,"This is still easily the best show I have ever seen. Better call Saul was good, but not the same.

Breaking Bad blows Game of Thrones out of the water. It finished perfectly. The entire series is great. Plenty of rewatch value.

The cinematography is great.

Directing is great. Show is very suspenseful. Cliffhangers are relevant and deserving.

Show has a unique feel to it. Quite spacey.

Take it as it is and you will enjoy.

A masterpiece.

i will strongly recommend everyone to watch this atleast once in their life"
10.0,25 June 2012,"Calling Breaking Bad a drama is a gross understatement. It transcends all other dramas and all other shows of any category. Watching the pilot is like reaching into a bag of potato chips and pulling out the first chip. It's delicious and tasty and you want to eat the whole bag.  The main character is Walter White, an extremely overqualified high school chemistry teacher who has gone through most of his life without making any decisions for himself. He has a wife who loves him and a disabled son and his unconditional love for them is amazing. During his second job at a run down carwash, he passes out and is sent to the hospital where he finds out he has stage 4 inoperable lung cancer. Walt's reaction to this news is one of the most brilliant things I've seen. The doctor is explaining it to him and all Walt can think about is a mustard stain on the doctor's lab coat. It's the perfect metaphor for Walt's personality. The combination of cancer and everyone trampling all over him his whole life causes him to ""break bad"" and do what he needs in order to provide for his family, even if that includes cooking meth. Walt didn't just decide on meth out of the blue though. His brother in the DEA takes him to a meth lab bust where he runs into an old student, Jessie. Jessie is an underachieving punk who cooks and sells meth in his free time. Walt sees him as a business partner and it's the beginning of a beautiful and twisted friendship. Walt uses his chemistry expertise to cook the best meth anyone has seen and Jessie helps him distribute. The struggles that Walt and Jessie go through keep you on the edge of your seat to the point where you fall off. All of the acting in the show is amazing. We instantly see ourselves in Walt and the whole point of the show is that none of us would do any different if we were him. I don't know how perfect writing, perfect acting, and perfect cinematography all came together in one show, but it's a perfect storm that will never happen again (and wont last forever due to the cancer eating away at Walt). It's the best show I've ever seen by far and it puts all other shows to shame. A few episodes in and you'll be addicted to it like meth and you'll love every second."

10.0,29 August 2012,"Honestly I have to say that this is the best TV-series I have ever seen. I simply can't find a fault in it. The story is very interesting and it is developing so well and after all it is even quite plausible.

Walter White is great, as well as Jesse Pinkman, and there is nothing bad to say about the other characters either. This whole being quiet thing though remains as a question; for me as a Scandinavian it is OK and natural, but I have always thought that the Americans are just not capable of that. But perhaps it really is like that in a professional drug business, no empty words are said or nothing unnecessary. In a way I just love this mysteria this creates, people come and go, some even keeping themselves totally unknown. Everything is not explained and totally covered like in some series.

What I especially love is how these characters develop. From the beginning to the close of end it is sometimes hard to even imagine them to be the same actors, same characters. But in the end that is how it goes in real life too; someone you used to know five years ago might not be at all the same... People change so quickly, especially under the pressure."
10.0,31 December 2020,"You can't even think about it twice, this show is truly one of a kind. Absolute brilliance from character development to cinematography, this show has it all."
10.0,12 September 2013,"This show is amazing, with a story that is very intriguing, and suburb acting to really make it shine. Episodes are thrilling and exciting, keeping you interested until the end, then ending the episode with very suspenseful cliffhangers to make you anticipate the next episode, constantly thinking about what might happen next. When the next episode airs, it doesn't disappoint, further increasing your addiction to this show about making drugs.

The characters are all very well thought out, all with their own important roles to make this the best show currently airing on TV. Following the actions of chemistry teacher Walter White, this show takes you on a journey of meth cooking goodness. However, it's so much more than just a show that some drug addict would watch, it is a show with the potential of being loved by anyone.

If you haven't watched this show, get on it. From the pilot, all the way to the finale, you will be hooked and unable to stop watching. Now stop reading reviews on this and start watching it."

10.0,22 January 2021,"Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever watched to date, and I've watched a lot of TV. Sure, sometimes the characters were a little obnoxious (especially when they were just used as liability), but it was all necessary for a great plot.

Whenever I watch TV now, it's just comparatively worse. Not to say that I haven't gotten into new shows since Breaking Bad, I definitely have. But this show really raised my expectations for TV. I used to be totally fine with just watching straight garbage because I would be like, ""Oh this is just how TV is."" I can no longer do that."
10.0,16 September 2020,"What can I say that thousands of people people haven't said already. This show is hands down the best ever, in every single aspect. Watched it 3 times and I'm planning for a 4th time. A masterpiece."
10.0,22 January 2021,Breaking Bad is well written story. The casting were perfect. The best show ever highly recommended.
10.0,14 August 2013,"I cannot say it enough-The character development from season one to 5 is incredible. I am seeing some blossom, some deteriorate, some grow stronger-Its what keeps you wanting more! Totally worth starting at Season 1 Episode 1 if you have been considering it, jumping in the middle means you lose a lot of what makes you salivate for the next episode, that being the hints and sparks of things yet to come. You fall in love with Jesse's adversities and Walter is a character you can almost understand because of the things he encounters-even on his extreme level, you can still get him and who he is. So much action and hidden messages or jokes, its like seeing a new clue every time you re-watch the episodes. There is nothing I can really say negatively about this show overall. Some episodes are full of build up and can be anti-climactic but if you feel you are losing faith-give it another episode and your mind will be blown. Its one of the best shows I have seen out these days-I find myself cursing out loud because I become so invested in the action and the plot. I suggest this for anyone who enjoys movies such as clockwork orange or Django."
10.0,26 May 2020,Of all the shows I have watched this is the best. Great action and storytelling through out and after all of this to not be disappointed by the ending is a massive bonus nowadays.
1.0,8 February 2017,"I know films can be amazing and all but sometimes TV shows are truly something else. I felt it with Game of Thrones and recently with Westworld, but the first time I truly realized how incredible TV shows can be was when I saw Breaking Bad. It honestly blew me away. The acting (especially from Cranston), the story, the characters, the direction, the cinematography, the editing, etc. were all phenomenal and I was just in awe of its craft (especially as the show progressed). Ozymandias or Face Off might honestly be the best 50 minutes of anything I've ever seen. Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, one of the greatest forms of entertainment ever."
10.0,15 January 2021,"I can't describe with words what this show means to me. It truly holds a special place in my heart. In my opinion, everyone can find something in Breaking Bad that they can relate to. Walter's Anti-Hero tendencies, Jesse's youthful charisma, Skyler's love of family and strong will. Hell, even Junior's love of breakfast food, or on a more serious level, his genuinely good natured upbringing. The character development is honestly among the best I've ever seen, or will see. Much like in our own lives, each encounter shapes the characters and makes them some of the most dynamic I've had the pleasure of experiencing.

This show has a cult following. Many of it's die hard fans, like myself, can never seem to stop rewatching it. We own Breaking Bad memorabilia, discuss it religiously, so far as to accidentally annoy people on occasion. People sometimes ask why that is, what's the ""thing"" that is so timeless and emotionally captivating about Breaking Bad? I describe it like therapy to watch and experience. Its script, setting, acting, cast, characters, their relationships... It's all just so incredibly well done. I apologize for the lack of depth in this review. I could write 5,000 words on this series and break down each episode. Bottom line, you just need to watch it. I wish I could erase my memory and watch it for the first time again.

As good as TV gets."

Sometimes you have to laugh but at the same moment you are often shocked too. Your smile could freeze sometimes. :) After I've watched a few episodes now I'm totally convinced that this is one of the best TV shows ever! The characters appear very realistic, the camera angles are brilliant. Every episode has a surprising beginning, the endings are just art! What I like most are the pictures and the artful way to show objects and details. I've never seen this in any other TV show before.

This show, and especially this season has transcended television programming in a way like no other, we never in a million years deserved a gift like this, but we were lucky enough to have had it handed to us on a silver platter. How did it earn such universally high critical praises and become so absolutely adored among all types of fans year after year? It doesn't have mind bending, mesmerizing special effects, it has no zombies and it certainly isn't about vampires. Breaking Bad has shown us how a simple narrative with the correct execution and proper slow burn can become something that is so impeccable that it in itself becomes real. The father to all of this is the scripting and the writing, I will say it again, the writing. The show had an amazing staff and was perfectly cast but without the brilliant writing team to back them up it would have turned into another show with big stars who went to waste; boy did it not. This show had more memorable moments and lines than any program or film ever will. Breaking Bad dropped more jaws than any dentist would ever consider healthy, not by using grotesque savagery, instead simply by compelling us with consummately masterful story telling and the five greatest years of drama I will ever remember.

Farewell to a titan."
10.0,1 December 2020,"If you haven't seen Breaking Bad, I urge you to watch it. You will not regret it. The amount of detail is outstanding. Absolute journey of a lifetime. Currently re-watching for the 6th time.

It can start off a little slow, but pay attention to the details. It gets better and better every season, and the last 4/5 episodes are the best TV I've ever seen. Wish I could give it more than 10 stars!"
10.0,9 March 2014,"Definitely one of the all time best. Pitch-perfect story-telling with pitch-perfect acting. Not every episode is a masterpiece, but enough are to make the series a stunning television achievement and a must watch for anyone looking for quality programming. As the series explores the ups and downs of Bryan Cranston's everyman, and as circumstances force the everyman to spiral in and out of control, the viewer is caught up in the often compassionate and touching, and often horrifying and gut-wrenching situations and decisions he haphazardly or possibly in a state of panic, makes for a decidedly misguided (but wholly understandable) purpose. The love, the hate, the forgiveness, the revenge, the humor, the sadness, the loyalty, the betrayal, the goodness, and the evil, it's all there, and it's done to perfection. Watch this man make the ultimate sacrifice for what may or may not be the ultimate reason (and was it really worth it). Fortunately for the rest of us, this journey was totally worth it."
1.0,4 May 2019,"This show doesn't deserve all the praises it gets. It certainly does have its moments action wise, but the characters are way to flat to carry the whole story for that amount of time. The side characters don't seem to have any personality whatsoever with the exception of Hank. Walter's wife and son are just walking stereotypes of the middle class suburban household but without any feelings. They get into superficial fights but there is no love or anything, no deep connection normal people tend to have with family or friends. This bland character writing is also evident with other figures like Fring or Marie. The same goes for Walter and Jesse. None of them really experiences any character development. Walter is an evil guy from the beginning, just hiding behind the curtain of a family man. Jesse, while a little less evil, seems strangely indifferent to everything and even when playing the role of a good guy for some time he solely drowns in self-sorrow, that's all. No empathy, no character change. There is no real personal struggle like normal people would experience and therefore I lost interest in their fate pretty quickly. Talking to your family like they are estranged relatives you just want to get rid of before turning into an equally unfeeling murderer doesn't count as character development. I recommend watching Gomorra instead, there is a lot of violence and everyone is horrible but you can also feel the love the characters have for their families and fear for their well-being so you care for the story a lot more."
10.0,30 August 2020,"Are you telling me that this show with barely average story, characters' weird actions and reactions and nothing exciting whatsoever has a better rating than shows like Game of Thrones, Sherlock, Daredevil or Dexter, that this show is, without any doubt, vastly inferior to? I guess the world is, indeed, breaking bad. To each their own, I see that some users even admitted watching it multiple times. Well, careful not to overdose on this diluted product."
9.0,8 June 2021,"I haven't watched much television but the notable shows I have watched are Game of Thrones, One Piece, Attack on Titan, and now Breaking Bad.

Please to all the Breaking Bad fans here. Try Attack on Titan, I know the anime genre isn't for everyone but after giving breaking bad a chance I can tell you it was an amazing show, but everything you think will happen happens, five attack on Titan a try if you truly appreciate good television and thank me when you finish season 3.

Breaking bad is easily a 9.5-10/10 but so is attack on Titan, give it a shot you won't regret it, I sure didn't regret giving breaking bad a chance, don't knock something until you try it!"
10.0,7 October 2013,This show has changed my life forever. I will never be the same after knowing that they will no longer make new episodes.

10.0,27 March 2021,I'm not gonna spoil anything. It's best to go into this show completely blind.
10.0,28 January 2013,"I created an IMDb account just to rant and rave about Breaking Bad. Yes that's how much I enjoyed it! Have a read:

I finished watching Breaking Bad, the complete 4 seasons this weekend (2008-2013, a 5-year long TV Series by AMC). It is by far, hands down, the best Criminal TV Series I have seen in the last 20 years of watching film of my life. Ever since I was watching my first TV series at seven years old at home, there has never been a more fascinating blow-you-out-of-the-water Criminal TV series for me. If you are a fan of Criminal-mystery/Gangster movies and series such as The Goodfellas, The Godfather, Minority Report, American Gangster, Pulp Fiction, Traffic, Leon the Professional, Nikita (2009) and many others in the similar Criminal/Gangster/Mystery category of Film and Series, then don't stop reading: Imagine all of the best sequences that you've experienced in your years of watching criminal movies and series and put them all together in one large basket of good movie memories of suspense, action, drama. Put those all together and add them up in you mind's eye and you'll come to the realization that some of the most intense scenery you've seen on-screen have been from the best crime movies out there. Put all of that together in your mind, and it will still not add up to the sum of intense suspense and drama you will experience from watching Breaking Bad. This TV series is an experience that will blow you away.

Looking back at some classic directors such as Hitchcock; the old-fashioned famous thriller movie director, Spielberg; the modern-day but still one of the most famous criminal action/mystery/thriller directors in the past 15-20 years, George Lucas; for his Star Wars films the last 50 years, and Joel Surnow; La feme Nikita ('90s TV series) they all have one aspect in common. They present to the viewer a 'Get ready for it, here it comes!! - suspense intensity' that is kind of expected to be found. The director wants you to expect it to enjoy what you are watching so that you crave more excitement. Director Vince Gilligan of Breaking Bad creates suspense in a wholly different manner. What you will experience while watching his series is a strung-out, slow-paced 'Wait for it, the consequences will hit the fan a few episodes from now...' Then when you expect the drama to play out, after he creates that mindset for you, it won't happen. Dead stop. Why? Because later, instead, it will come back so hard and so intensely at the least expected moment, that it will practically knock you off of your seat. The intensity that Vince builds up for you is nothing short of genius. Figuratively describing this, as long as you're paying attention, you will not believe how dramatic and strong the suspense comes and hits you right in the face and smacks you down onto the ground. Then after it hits you down, it then proceeds to take a bulldozer and flatten you until you're about as thin as a coin, after which the coin is dropped into magma and liquidized. That's a small taste of how this series will make you feel, in a good way. Given to say if you're not focused and you're not paying attention to an episode with scenes that happened two episodes ago, you'll probably not remember what the consequence will become in the episode that you're watching at present. If that's the case then don't watch Breaking Bad because you don't deserve it anyway.

Don't live life without experiencing maybe the best criminal TV series in today's era, because it will probably change your life. Take a couple of weeks from your regular movies or series and watch the four seasons of Breaking Bad and you'll agree, it was worth every single minute. Did I mention? It will change your life."
10.0,28 May 2021,"This is by far the best show i have ever seen. Everything about it, the acting, clothing, setting, music, etc is amazing. This show does such a great job at portraying the emotions it's almost like i can literally feel what the characters are feeling. One of my favorite things about breaking bad is that there are so many easter eggs in this show and pretty much everything in this show has a meaning, from paintings on the wall to a fricken fly. Every time i thought i figured something out, there was a twist to it that left me in awe. I wish i could watch this show for the first time again. 110% recommend. (don't watch if u can't handle gore btw. There's not a ton of it but there is definitely a fair share)"
10.0,19 May 2020,The benchmark of every TV show I watch. Other shows are either Breaking Bad level or not.

10.0,11 June 2021,"Hands down to the best writing I have ever seen any Tv show and elements of foreshadowing in this show is unmatchable with any other show in this world and coming to the performances of leads, what can I say 🙏🙏 just BREAKING BAD...Walter white is the best badass I have ever witnessed."
10.0,26 August 2013,"The thespian abilities of all actors are excellent. Unpredictable happenings, always genius solutions for key scenes. I'm infected. First TV Show that manages it to force the audience to sympathize with the good and the bad guys but bizarrely these characters are mixed up what is extremely exciting. Aaron Paul seems to fit perfectly into his character.

It's not mainly about the topic drugs it's mainly about people coping with unusual situations caused by unusual happenings at first. The golden thread that is created throughout the show is genius. Bryan Cranston showed already in Malcom in the Middle that he's mutable. His ""Heisenberg"" is so convincing! Thanks! Looking forward for the next time: ""Previously on AMCs breaking bad...."" :))))"
10.0,7 May 2019,
10.0,15 January 2021,"Re-watched 7 times, Vince Gilligan and all the actors are simply incredible!"
10.0,21 September 2018,"This show is fantastic in every aspect: acting, plot, philosophical messages, character development, cinematography, writing, presentation, etc. I highly recommend this show to everyone!!"
10.0,1 July 2020,"This series is extremely detailed and symbolic, it provides important impressive lessons. With a lysergic script, innovative photography and extraordinary performances, it quickly became the hallmark of the new golden age of television. I can say that the plot was well tied, since it ended as one of the most critically acclaimed endings, mainly due to its sharp script.

Its atmosphere is excellent with an message about self-development. Advance, change, learn and do new things, reach new and better results, achieve higher goals, make up a journey that requires determination, focus, courage, sweat, sacrifices, corrections of route. This is the inexorable tone of constant development, both personally and professional.

The production reflects on the journey of self-knowledge and self-development, highlighting some important aspects that may go unnoticed by many. For example, he points out that it is through self-knowledge that our shadows need to be identified and, from there, faced / overcome.

The message as a whole encourages the viewer to follow the indispensable path of looking at themselves (self-knowledge) and, of course, to follow the path of evolution (self-development). Undoubtedly, a little deeper reflection on the theme, but necessary.

Obviously they used Walter White as a mediator of this philosophical reflection. The great and only sin of the series was the superficiality of the objectives for the other characters, they imply that they are only there to complement. Because of that, I have my doubts about whether Breaking Bad is a character-driven or a plot-driven."
1.0,15 October 2010,"I was wondering why Mr. White picked the name Heisenberg during his interview with gang leader Tuco. After watching the remaining episodes it became more clear. Those who have an engineering background will recall ""Heisenberg uncertainty principle"" which states that: certain physical properties such as position and momentum can not be known exactly at the same time.

Well same applies here to Mr. White aka Heisenberg and to this flawless show. What i speculate while watching and what really happens during the show never matches. You get flicks while expecting closure and you get intense moments of thinking on characters/story on the verge of a burst. After a while you stop guessing what will happen and drift to the attraction of great acting and unexpected storytelling. The tempo of creating suspension, developing characters and turnovers in story and the repetition of this whole cycle evolves into something quite original, into something I believe that is never done before.

There are a lot to say about for this cleverly made show ... I hope we see more work like this."
10.0,4 March 2014,
10.0,27 November 2020,"Best series ever for me! The most important from the series and we also see that in real life, is that when something looks very bad we have to look behind of the someones actions of to find the real reasons! Also the amazing scenario doesn't leave everyone with the same conclusion for what was better to done!"
10.0,24 October 2011,"I feel i have to write this review, to many times in life writers, directors, actors and the little old camera man don't get the prise they deserve. Breaking Bad for me scores a 10 in every department. All there hard work came together in latest feast of drama, intrigue and action. A true master piece of television which will surly heat up the debate, has the modern day TV series overtaken the Movie as the most entertaining media. With the likes of Broadwalk Empire and Game of thrones, does the Movies still offer us the public quality entertainment or mismatch of special effects and poor story lines......."
10.0,18 May 2021,Everyone watched it amazing so just go watch it if you haven't...can't explain how amazing it is.
10.0,14 May 2019,"Yes, this is the story of a Chemistry teacher turned Drug Lord and yes, this is the story that needs no fire breathing dragons, no walking dead people and no nonsense people with nonsense powers to keep you entertained. This series is an Epitome of story writing and screenplay. Extraordinarily plain, simple and enjoyable."
10.0,30 October 2020,"Breaking Bad's story was pretty simple but the execution was awesome. The casting alone was brilliant. Every single character was casted perfectly, and I mean perfectly. You get absorbed into this world you never thought you would meet, nor have you ever seen before. As the seasons progress, the story becomes more and more intense and perfect. The show actually takes you to a place that you never saw coming and it is actually a place of truth. Overall, I have very few words for this show. It's next to masterpiece."
10.0,16 May 2020,I have no word to describe the whole series. No one can match up with Breaking Bad.
10.0,29 October 2012,"Breaking Bad, the first season is MIND BLOWING, and as you go you think it can't get any better but you are wrong. As you go on to the next seasons you start to see this character transformation in Walter White and how he gets sucked in into the world of crystal me-th. You start to see how much he cares about his business and the longer you go the darker the seasons get. Breaking bad is a MASTERFUL work of art that is brilliantly written and has a great story. This is definitely one of the best televisions drama shows that has been created and you can never go wrong with breaking bad if you want to watch a good show. Breaking bad is simply great and will blow your mind in several occasions. I truly recommend Breaking Bad for every one,and to quote Walter White ""I am not afraid of danger, because I AM danger"""

10.0,30 December 2020,A perfect series with a fine build up and a perfect ending. Nothing bad could be said about breaking bad. Indeed a classic show. I watched all seasons so many times over. Never could I get bored of any of the episodes.
5.0,17 January 2012,"Breaking Bad is my favorite show of all time. I am glad that I'm not alone in this belief, and it is one of the greatest misfortunes that people out there either have not seen or do not appreciate this show.

People often compare Breaking Bad to Weeds, because it is about a parental unit resorting to selling drugs in order to provide for his family. Except that Breaking Bad is actually realistic, truly dramatic, and doesn't start grasping at straws by the time the second season ends. The best part about the show is how organically it progresses. With other shows, transitions can seem forced, but with Breaking Bad, the entire series feels like one long season. Things that happen in Season 1 actually have meaning in Season 4.

It's also just incredible how engaging the series is. Everyone acts so well, and the storyline is so rich and layered you get blown away multiple times an episode. You really gotta hand it to Bryan Cranston. If you had told me ten years ago that the Dad from Malcolm in the Middle would be performing superbly as a meth dealer, I would've laughed in your face. By the end of the first episode of Breaking Bad, I already associated Cranston more with Walter than Hal.

Watch this show, you will not be disappointed. It's as deep and rewarding as any show can get. It's also amazing such gold would turn up on AMC rather than a premium cable network. Nothing HBO has ever produced can get close to Breaking Bad, as good as those shows are."
10.0,5 August 2012,
10.0,8 May 2019,"I don't understand the hype the hoopla the show has. So i started watching it and season after season i hope it will get better, intelligent and more gripping but it failed on all counts."
10.0,19 November 2020,"I can easily say this is the best movie after the year 2000 up until today. I still can't find any better movie. The plot, the acting skills, everything was just perfect. I saw another movie with a high rating like Ozark, but I could only watched 2 episodes because I keep comparing that movie with Breaking Bad so it became too painful to watch that movie, they're on a very different level. The comparison feels like talking to Walter White and Brandon Mayhew."
10.0,8 June 2021,What a acting by Walter white and Jasse pinkman. 1st one on my favourite list of series.
10.0,23 May 2012,
10.0,26 September 2011,"Breaking Bad - to me is the best TV series out there so far. That itself i still reckon is an understatement of how good this show is.

It is pretty obvious : This show pretty much sums up what Breaking Bad means, ""turning to the darkside"" - pretty much for good. I enjoyed how the Director and the script writer gives you an authentic feeling to this TV Series. At times, you can feel the characters in there, share their sentiment - provided that you have been following this series since day one.

Most of my mates complained that this TV series is ""too slow - dramatic"", at times I will admit, it is pretty dramatic - but in a good sense of the word. It puts you in the front seat, witnessing how good turns to bad, and bad becomes to worst. Breaking Bad is unique, and when I say unique, it is not your usual day to day TV series. Not your usual ""big bang theory, the mentalist, how i met your mother"" series. Breaking Bad for me stands out among the rest, because every episode is crafted to perfection.

I doubt I will be able to put in words how good Breaking Bad is, and how much I've enjoyed it. Name me a TV series that you reckon in the last 5 years is good, and I'll assure you Breaking Bad is better."
10.0,8 December 2020,The best Integrated series I've ever seen in my whole life.
10.0,10 April 2022,"It's not only a tv show, it's a free class to change your life. Live your own life and never ever care about anything. I used to be an assertive person but this tv show changed me to aggressive in such way helped me to say no to the wrong people."
2.0,22 January 2021,"Everything is great at this show. Bryan Cranston at his best. Even when it comes to Jesse, he has delivered extremely brilliant perfomance being ""pathetic"" each time. And every character is great in its own way. Last but not least, everything was right until Saul Goodman showed up.. later it became ""too much right""😂😂.."
10.0,8 June 2021,Best show I've ever seen! I love Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.
10.0,4 February 2023,"Breaking Bad was a complete waste of time. The characters were one dimensional and lacked any real depth. The plot was slow and dragged on for far too long, and the portrayal of drug use and crime was insensitive and glorified dangerous behavior. The show tried to pass itself off as edgy and thought-provoking, but in reality it was just a poorly executed mess. Avoid this show at all costs.

I was extremely disappointed with Breaking Bad. The writing was predictable and lacked originality. The characters were inconsistent, making it difficult to invest in their journeys. The show also failed to effectively address important social issues, instead opting for shock value and sensationalism. The cinematography was unimpressive and did not add to the overall experience. Overall, Breaking Bad was a major letdown and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a quality television show.

Breaking Bad was one of the most overhyped shows I've ever watched. Despite all the praise and accolades it received, I found it to be a poorly crafted and executed mess. The writing was incredibly lazy and lacked any real substance. The characters were poorly developed and their motivations often felt forced and contrived.

The show's attempt at tackling serious social and cultural issues was also a major disappointment. Instead of offering insightful commentary or thought-provoking perspectives, Breaking Bad fell back on sensationalism and shock value to grab the audience's attention. This not only made the show feel cheap and shallow, but it also trivialized important issues and reinforced harmful stereotypes.

The cinematography and direction were equally underwhelming. The show relied heavily on formulaic visual cues and lacked any real visual flair. The overall look and feel of the show was dull and uninspired.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad was a major disappointment and a waste of time. If you're looking for a quality television show that tackles important issues in a meaningful and insightful way, look elsewhere. Breaking Bad is not worth your time or attention."
10.0,29 November 2020,"I've watch BB twice , first time on april and the second on november and i've think i enjoyed even more then the first time so that's the proof of how perfect this show is"
10.0,2 March 2022,"This show is so good that I named a pair of dogs I adopted after the two main characters (Walter and Jesse). My son and I are rewatching it along with listening to a podcast that breaks down each episode. I guess you can say I can't get enough of BB. There is no better writing for a tv show than this one. Each episode is its own mini movie. The production values are equal to any high dollar movie being made today. The acting is award worthy every episode from every person on screen. I'm telling you, if you miss out watching this show you are missing out on something that will be remembered as one of the most influential shows in history."

I've watched series like Prison Break, TWD, Sons of Anarchy, Vikings and Suits, but Breaking Bad is definetly the best out of all of them! The directors of BB was a GENIOUS! The actors was just unbelievable great! From the start of the show and till the end, it was all MAGNIFICENT! Both Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were at their top acting class! They both got Golden Globes and BB did too, which was WELL DESERVED! Thanks to the producers and the actors for an amazing journey❤"
10.0,8 June 2021,"Some of the acting from the very side characters may be meh, and one time a character feels a certain way for 4 episodes that doesnt seemed earned. Those are my complaints. For a 62 episode series with 45+min episodes, those are my complaints.

Everything else is perfect. Cinematography, directing, acting from main and recurring cast, and WRITING. The plot moves along so fluidly and every piece of every story means something. Whether it be character development, eventual intersecting to the main plot, or even comic relief, every scene means something. Also, the show just KEEPS GETTING BETTER. It ONLY gets better from Season 1.

Basically every season moves along with certain drama occurring, some action and violence here and there, but nothing too crazy. Then, it all COLLIDES in extreme climaxes that change the entire story of the show and every character involved. Little things come back into play and relationships that have been building and strained must be tested. Where do people stand? What are they willing to do? Who will be left?

Seasons 4 and 5 are two of the best seasons of TV you could ever watch. The last 8 episodes are straight up a THRILLER movie. Back to back (x4), each episode ends with a cliffhanger that will most certainly lead to you taking another 45 minutes out of your day.

It's my #1 recommendation always. If you havent seen it, what the hell are you doing?"
1.0,7 February 2016,
10.0,13 September 2020,"It is a great show for binge watching. The way in which the show slowly steps towards the end is just brilliant.

Nearly every aspect of episode, from the story to the acting to the sound and then directing and cinematography are top notch. I personally can't re-watch a TV series without getting bored really quick (2 episodes into Lost I was done), but I've seen this series 4 times already and am excited for just about every episode (peek a boo kills me, I skip through a lot of that episode) and will do so again when I have the final episodes in hand.

I think that if you have any excuse at all to start a series from scratch, this is the one for you."

10.0,3 January 2015,"I started watching Breaking Bad in 2011. I found the first season interesting but season 2 became somewhat of a bore and i left midway... DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.

I gave it a second shot in 2014 and it blew me away. I finished the remaining episodes in a week. The plot, storyline and character development is amazing and the main cast is brilliant!! Bryan Cranston plays a role that makes you sympathize with him no matter what monstrosity he commits but for me the standout was Paul Arron. The way his character changes over the course of the show was something to behold! If you have started watching the show and feel it is a little slow, PLEASE do not give up! It will be worth your while. Its the best show i have watched"
1.0,18 July 2017,"Wow, congratulations to all the staff, the writers, the directors, the actors that made possible to create this unique emotional experience. Thank you Netflix giving me this opportunity. I am surprised about the strong content and message to all of us audience. I enjoyed every part of it with dramatic and unexpected turns. There are many interesting details from the drug scene. They are developed and shown very professionally that I have never seen before in other thrillers of this genre. Check this out. It is a great entertainer that you won't forget for the rest of your life. This is why it deserves 10/10."
10.0,7 January 2021,Once you've seen it you will never again feel 100 % satisfied with a tv-show again.
10.0,27 November 2020,"I only watched this because everyone seemed to be obsessed with it and raving about how good it was. I had high expectations of finding a new favorite show but maybe I should have expected less.

Admittedly, I don't like cancer stories and I don't like looking at a desert so that put me off. It wasn't enough to ruin the show though. I guess I was expecting something with a faster pace and more action and drama. But it felt slow and didn't make me feel anything at all. I like shows to make me feel something or react and feel invested in the characters. Breaking Bad didn't deliver that. After a couple seasons, I was bored to death and gave up.

Maybe it gets better and I missed all the good stuff. Maybe I was just spoiled because I came into the show late. Idk. But I don't get the hype for this show. The characters and story just aren't that great. You couldn't pay me to finish this borefest."
9.0,26 May 2020,"Best series ever, no doubt. Better than Got and mad men and anything"
9.0,9 August 2021,"In my opinion I still have not seen anything like breaking bad yes, i have watched games of thrones but no television series is as convincing as breaking bad. For me the best part about a TV series is its consistency in terms of the pace it has. From the very first episode till the last one the story accelerates in a uniform pace, maintaining which is a very tedious task and needs a lot of caution. It must have been really challenging to make it the way its made. For obvious reasons I bing-watched it on a very subtle recommendation of a cousin. It kept me hooked, every moment i was into it."
10.0,16 December 2020,I can only talk about it in superlatives...It's a brilliant masterpiece that can't be missed in any way. After seeing it you will think over everything what you seen this before as it sets a new standard for you...at least it was what I felt... Simply no proper words to describe...

10.0,3 January 2015,"No review needed, just a short story to persuade you to watch!!

I am one of those lucky people who had never heard of this show during its run, so watched it all in one hit! A guy in work asked if I had seen it and said how amazing it was, which I pretty much ignored, however, within two weeks a further three people all said the same thing to me, ""YOU MUST SEE THIS SHOW!""

So I downloaded the first few eps and the wife and I settled down. We were instantly hooked and watched several that night and i downloaded the lot the same night.. we literally watched the entire 62 episodes in about 10-12 nights watching 5 or 6 a night... she would come home from work and without even having tea and say ""put another Breaking bad on""..

This was about a year ago, my dad recently heard of it and asked me to download it for him, and I watched ep1 again as a recap and that was that.. I re-watched the entire lot again in about 10-14 nights, as hooked as I was the first time round...

My dad came round the other other night after having seen 4 or 5 eps of S01 and basically just said ""WOW, I need more episodes of this asap..."".... Basically if you have never seen it, go watch it!!"
10.0,6 September 2020,
10.0,23 September 2011,"In the middle of fourth season I have a need to say something about Breaking Bad. I always had my favorite TV shows and I have them today, like it is Dexter or Game of Thrones, but Breaking Bad goes on the top of everything I watched and that I am watching. I must give great regards to all of the crew of the show, as any aspect here is first class. It is rare feeling for one TV show to be that good.

It is hard to be objective here, but what everyone agrees is that acting, cinematography and music is on higher standards of regular TV work. During first season I found its plot not just original but so involving and with other seasons it just become an addiction for more.

This fourth season is magnificent in its way and when I search for awards and opinions there is nothing but thrills.

And I agree. Even villains here are not just likable, and officials (DEA) are perceived as opposite to that.

The crystal met is a very bad drug, and we all know that, but here we don't think about it that way, actually the Art of the creators of the show made lead us to feel positive for our heroes. I don't know much about drugs, I only know how met is bad, but here you have feeling that met they produce might not be so harmful? Never mind it is only show.

I think that there are many moral issues here, and how they vague family life with criminal activity is masterfully. The whole positive thinking about it (Mr. White character) is that he did that because of caring of his family, as he is not negative person. And character Jesse is simply adorable, even in the criminal context, yet rightful and with high moral in itself.

I am happy that there will be one season more. This show simply deserves to be put in the film library as a rare masterfully achievement for TV with cult status like it is memorable Sopranos, Star Trek NG, Mission Impossible, Seinfeld, Twilight Zone and Tales from the Crypt to mention some of the best ever."
10.0,2 June 2021,I wish i could delete this tv show from my mind and then watch it over and over again This tv show is very enjoyable and you should understand it well and focus on it!truly its a masterpiece.
10.0,7 June 2020,"I have never fully enjoyed a series like breaking bad , it was so realistic and emotional . What a great job Vince!"
10.0,4 October 2013,"Some TV dramas deserve 10's and this is one of them. May be the greatest TV drama ever written. May be better than the Sopranos. Visceral, scary, exhilarating, funny, excitingly vengeful,sad, pitiful, intelligent... .

Never has any two actors so filled the screen in one show and grabbed one than both stars with Cranston grabbing more due to his incredibly stellar screen presence, but I think we are in for surprises from Paul in future roles.

Cranston was born for this role. Cranston was born to act and does so with such convincing conviction I never thought he was acting at any point. The same goes for Paul and really, most every other actor, including Norris who was stellar and Gunn, Brandt and Mitte.

Yes I'm gushing but who doesn't with such a great show.

Thanks AMC. Your the channel to beat nowadays."
10.0,11 May 2021,I kind of started watching it just for sake of its rating...kind of find it boring but in midway of season 1 i started enjoying...but then 3rd season was kind of average...but last two seasons were really good....but i find it kind of slow pacing and many events repeating ...it was a good show but never in my life i would rate it higher than GOT...Yay i know you can subtract last few episodes of got....
10.0,1 December 2020,I just want to say that this is the best show ever.
1.0,28 November 2013,"Bryan Cranston...man hats-off to you for your extraordinary acting!!...This is the best comedy-thriller drama you will ever see in decades..The choice of the character is awesome and the plot of this show is simply astonishing.Just watch the pilot and then you are hooked.This is one of those best shows that you can definitely count on.This show has every aspect of entertaining you.If you want a start any TV series just start it with Breaking Bad ..This show has got some real talent and some real acting with a powerful and substantial story.This is simply a Masterpiece created by Vince Gilligan.

A MASTERPIECE you don't wanna miss !!!!"
10.0,30 September 2013,"After watching the series Finale...Its time to post a review about this AWESOME SERIES....Breaking Bad is the best Drama series I have seen till date....The way they ended Season 4, we thought that should be it...but after watching the Series Finale...IT WAS ICING ON THE CAKE.... Its not about Walter or Jessie as a main characters. But each and everyone has given their best shot.Saul, Hank, Gus, Tuco...everyone has delivered their best career performance. At the end, credit goes to Vince who casted the perfect lineup, no wonder 50% of the main cast was in comic stream before this,,,especially Walter and Saul...but Vince pulled it out of em. For me he is the Christopher Nolan of small screen.WE WILL MISS YOU BREAKING BAD ....BADLLLYYYY!!!"

10.0,16 September 2013,"I have enjoyed every episode of this show. It has the best cinematography I've seen in a show with it's scenery and colour enhancement and the definition of everything to make effect on how the programme wants you to feel. Also, the acting is just amazing. The dark theme of this show really makes it that much more awesome because there just isn't a show like it, aside from 'Death note'. I love how the story line is so well thought out and constructed. The progression of the show and transformation of each character is simply great! The pilot is amazing and the episode I just watched ""Ozymandias"" is stunning. The show makes you feel emotions and really takes you into it, it makes a lot of people feel like they're actually experiencing what the characters are experiencing emotionally. The show is the most intense show I've ever seen and I've watched 'death note' and many other TV show's (Dexter, game of thrones, the x files, sons of anarchy etc); but Breaking bad beats them all. It is just incredible in so many ways, I love the way it makes me feel and it has elements of every emotion which I think is great, although the comedy is very dark, it is still comedy and I think it's great that they managed to fit that element in. I love how this is a show with a story line that has to end and I think that with it ending in the next 2 episodes, it is a wise decision and I'm glad the directors and writers have chosen to end it now as it show's that they are wanting this show to go out with a bang and it also show's they are wanting a good story line rather than a long lasting show for money. So for my conclusion: I would recommend this show to everyone who can experience it, I love this show and I am really sad that it is coming to an end yet it is right to end it now."
10.0,22 January 2021,"The best show ever created by a human being. Just a dot behind Attack on Titan, which in my opinion is a gift to humanity from God."
10.0,5 November 2013,"There is only one other show that could come close to rivaling Breaking Bad and that was The X- Files. I own all 9 seasons of The X-Files on DVD, and now Breaking Bad has taken 1st place on my list of Television Show Must Owns.

I'm not one to watch TV series year after year, but Vince Gilligan and crew created one heck of a masterpiece.

This wasn't a show which glorified drug use and crime (as I've had to explain to many who never cared enough to watch prior to making comments); it was a show about the human condition and what happens when ordinary people are placed within extraordinary situations.

What would you do, and how would you do it?

The concept of morality, good versus evil, black and white, or is morality only shades of gray... I've never seen any show deal with these concepts better than Breaking Bad.

Every single Emmy the show and cast received was very well earned."
10.0,13 November 2013,"Of course I didn't find out about this show until the series was concluded. Breaking Bad is an up in the now American crime drama television series produced and created by Vince Gilligan. The setting of Breaking Bad is Albuquerque New Mexico. It is about a high school chem teacher who is terminally ill with lung cancer. At this diagnosis Walter White (Bryan Cranston) turns about face to a life of violent crime, and turns to the drug trade, manufacturing and selling high quality methamphetamine with former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).

Top series writers are Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, George Mastras, Sam Catlin and Moira Walley-Beckett. Breaking Bad has won ten prime-time Emmy awards and Cranston took three wins consecutively for Best Actor.

Breaking Bad was one of the America's top leading TV shows and portrays violence, crime and intrigue. If you want to sit down for a good pique of your interest, then this series is the place to be.

But it's more than just great entertainment, Breaking Bad transcends typical crime dramas. Walter White has been the underdog his whole life. He's been taken advantage of and had bad luck at every turn. He's never achieved his dreams, never done anything courageous. And now he has a short time to live. He's always been a clean cut, honourable man. Until now. He's dying. He wants to make money to support his family. Most of all, he wants to make up for the time he feels he wasted. This drives him to do things that would make you hate any other man, but not Walter - no, you'll root for him to win.

This is the greatest TV show ever made, and every other show will have to sit at the kids table."
10.0,24 September 2013,"I started watching the series on Netflix the day before the premiere of the final season aired on AMC. It had been on my ""laundry list"" of shows to watch since about the middle of it's second season but I had never gotten around to watching it because I was just prepared that it wouldn't completely blow me away. So instead I watched Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock, It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, The Office and many, many other TV shows.

To my disappointment, I should have tuned in when the very first episode was aired.

Breaking Bad has taken the entire genre of TV dramas and TV shows in general to a new height of not only shock value but excellent writing and casting. Nearly each episode you're sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. Instead of one upping the previous episode by it's dramatic scenes or crazy ways of the illegal drug production, sale and so on, the writers make the absolute unexpected happen. It may seem like a lot of people say things such as, ""It's so crazy, you won't even see it coming."" in instances that it may be unexpected, but that is where Breaking Bad changed everything. It is impossible to tell what will happen next because that's just how well it is written and thought of. Down to each and every last detail is pressed out and made sure to be perfect before filming for the episode I'm sure even begun.

Don't pass up Heisenberg."
10.0,5 October 2020,"No other show has compelled me so much to write about it, and I have never written for any show as they weren't brilliant enough to reach this level. But this show!!!, what should I say? This is easily the greatest television show I have ever seen where everything and everyone is perfect. The way Vince Gilligan and his team have constructed this show in such a flawless manner is simply remarkable. Bryan Cranston gave the performance of a lifetime which is impossible to forget. The emotions that u will get will be impossible to enjoy again and you won't forget them at all and don't forget Jesse Pinkman and Anna Gunn's incredible performances. Episodes like Ozymandias, Felina, Face Off, Crawl Space and Granite State are a clear testimony to what is the best writing that can ever be produced where every move and every action is perfect. You won't feel your time wasted at all and the ending of felina is the best ending I have ever seen. Don't miss this art and thank you Vince Gilligan for gifting us this absolute gem. I have a lot to write but I can't, I have a lot to express but I can't, that's how freaking phenomenal this show is!!!"
5.0,30 January 2021,"Well it is the goddamn perfect show with the best script, acting and dialogues (just on another level). I ended this show 7 months ago but still it's got a place in my mind. I can never revive from this show. It left me thrilled. I watched a lot of shows after it but none of them were enough good ( except G. O. T it is equally good but haven't watched the ending yet I think the endings bad in G. O. T ) to be on is level."
10.0,11 January 2021,
10.0,16 September 2020,"Over rated. I don't understand why this show gained so much popularity. What am I missing? This has to be one of the stupidest shows I ever came across. Jesse Pinkman keeps making the same mistakes being the loser he is. And just to keep the show running, Walter White goes on helping this retard kid like he has no other option. The whole series revolves in the same loop. Absolutely over rated."
10.0,5 October 2020,"For me, it's hard to fathom how can a TV series be so pure and unique. I was rewatching the entire show years after I watched it the first time, went through it episode after episode to see if I could find something to critique on. And I failed everytime, just like I did years before.

A series having 5 seasons, which consists of 62 episodes in total, and still, not a single shortcoming. It sounds ridiculously impossible, and it is impossible theoretically. But somehow, Vince Gilligan made it possible. The execution is literally flawless.

Breaking Bad is a phenomenon of art and perfection. I have never seen anything like it in my life. For the people who haven't seen the show: please do yourselves a favour, you know what it is."
10.0,20 September 2013,"I don't even want to write a review. Breaking Bad IS the best show to ever grace TV screens, and unless Vince Gilligan outdoes himself in the future with an even better show (however hard to fathom) this IS and WILL BE the best show you'll ever see. I would now like to see Gilligan get into the movies and pull another trick out of his hat. This is the golden age of TV and Breaking Bad is its flagship, thanks to cast, cinematographers, directors, and most of all Vince Gilligan, the show's creator, and his co-writers. I hope these talents spill into cinema, grab it by the horns and give it a good shake up, because it needs people with attributes, BADLY!"
10.0,30 March 2021,Breaking Bad is the best. Calling it a good show would be an understatement. I have seen most of the top 50 good shows of all time and this one stands out every time. Please don't listen to the criticisms. These people are sore losers who have no idea what a good tv show is all about.
10.0,17 November 2020,"I've never watched somethimg better than this (and I saw ""Dark"" ""GoT"" and some others). Right now I'm crying - since I just watched the last episode - the entire series is a perfect construction, a person construction, an empire construction and mainly, a perfect story construction. The worst thing after watching this series is that I'll never find something else like this, or atleast I hope onde day I can complain something in the same path and level."
10.0,26 August 2014,"Forty-two years ago the blessed Godfather hit our screens and from the generation that first viewed it, they have passed it down to their children as a must-see film, and after forty-two years the film still retains its ringing influence on the entertainment industry to the point it has and will continue to be viewed and studied from all areas of the world.

Breaking Bad, in my humble opinion, has the same ringing influence. I believe in forty-two years time and beyond this show will be passed down as the greatest piece of television ever created. Unfortunately we won't realise it yet as, just as the first generation that watched the godfather in 1972 didn't quite realise how much of an influence the film would have, the same can be said here as we are the first generation to view the excellence that is 'Breaking Bad'.

This is not a review per say but my way of expressing my gratitude to the show. I know it can be stupid to become too obsessed with film and TV to the point people say your not living in reality. But if we think about it, could it be that the influence of television and its ability to play with our emotions and thoughts just prove its shows more realism in our lives than we previously considered. This is what 'Breaking Bad' does so superbly, with Vince Gillingam trying to show how even the kindest of people can be the ones who are hiding their true hidden selves in the shadows.

The ability of this show that it makes you reflect months after about express the magnitude of influence it has. I for one have heard people describe it as the 'Greatest TV Show of all time' but here I disagree.

As this show is more than that, it honestly should be considered as one of the 'Greatest pieces of Art'. I wont tell you how or why but they only way you as a reader can find out is to pick up the remote and watch it - at first you may see it as just a normal TV show but I urge you to find the deeper connection it has to the viewer. The teachings on morality, family dedication, choices and loyalty. We live by these morals every day and the show helps us reflect on our actions and how we choose to live our life.

I know this is sounding really deep and I have no doubt I will be seen as a sap with someone thinking 'what a load of crap that guys talking about' and to you I say you're probably right. As what I'm saying probably hasn't made much sense and even when you watch the show it may not do either but maybe just maybe in 42 years time, you may be struck by the realisation of the artistic message this show had.

Prehaps my review can be contradicted by the show itself in Season 2's episode 'Better Call Saul'...





But the truth of that statement is up for you to debate upon. Just grab a drink and the remote!"

10.0,7 January 2021,"Awful I hate it. The pacing is off, the shoot out requires a sophisticated emotional response and yet does nothing to earn it. The editing is bad, with the overuse of slow motion shots."
10.0,7 January 2014,
10.0,30 September 2013,"Even though I don't write reviews very often, I will do this for this one. BB is one of the best TV shows in the last 10 years for sure. Brilliant storyline, unexpected twists, great acting and a great ending (unlike Dexter).

Lot of people talk about great actors who played Walt and Pinkmann, but my other favorites was the sleazy lawyer (brilliantly cast) and Skylar, Walts wife!

I think why this series is so great is that no character is black or white. They are very much on the gray scale- all characters have flaws and everyone can relate/understand them to a degree.

Of course Walts choice to start making drugs is questionable to many. But I think most people can relate to mid life crisis, desperation, self fulfillment and love for the family. We all make bad choices sometimes, but thankfully not as bad as Walt.

One thing I take with me after BB, is that even though we all have choices in life, we never really know where they are going to take us..."
10.0,7 June 2020,"This is the best series I have ever seen till now. Love the thrilling story, direction, cinematography, performances of all the characters. No series can replace Breaking Bad for me."
10.0,19 October 2015,"Breaking Bad is a perfect example that there is no need for special effects, zombies or blowing up buildings in order for a TV series to be excellent. The storyline and the combination of a variety of characters gives the series such balance and flow. The show gets better by season and eventually you are onto season 5 which is one of the most brilliant productions of all time.

The ending scene is sensational as we see how drug production really did destroy Walter White and create a new man in Heisenberg. Breaking bad truly does capture you emotionally which is something which keeps giving you the desire to watch the next episode. Overall, an incredible series."

You'll never regret watching it. Truly masterpiece."

10.0,12 July 2023,"Every so often I revisit the comments just to validate my own thoughts. This is, without any doubt the best show ever made, so far! The writing, the acting is second to none.

I am a firm believer, that 20-30 years from now we'll look back at this and realize that we were witnessing greatness!

The number of times you think you have it figured out and still be surprised is beyond real.

Walt and Pinkman is the best duo since Adam and Eve!

I was, as many others, surprised that anything but True Detective (season one) would be second to par, but this is simply mind blowing!

Watch it and rewatch it, you won't regret it."

10.0,18 October 2013,"Bryan Cranston delivers a phenomenal performance as Walter White, the chemistry teacher who turns to selling meth after he finds himself with cancer. the writing is insane it's so good I can't think of a word to describe how good it is. Then you have actors like Aaron Paul and dean Norris who just bring to life these characters with such great depth you feel yourself getting attached more and more as the show goes on and really just a must watch groundbreaking beast of a show, probably the only show I could rewatch over and over again for the rest of my life and not get bored. Thank you Vince Gilligan for bringing this show to life."

10.0,20 December 2011,"Ever Since the end of Lost I have been in a grim mood searching for a Show that meets my eye, just recently I started watching Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is a work of art, and is easily one of my two favorite dramas. The first season is absolutely mind blowing. Most shows start to drag on and run out of ideas, and start to really crap the bed. Breaking Bad seems to just get stronger through each season, the whole entire show runs on the literary technique of dramatic irony. Meaning the viewer knows something that the characters don't. I find the plot unbelievably creative and realistic. I am extremely excited for the fifth season coming out next summer, season four ended with a bang. Now Vince Gilligan has his hands full with a destined amazing last season."

10.0,12 June 2012,
10.0,2 June 2013,"My brother recommended this show to me a year ago or so because he said it was the best show he had ever seen. I got lucky and saw they were playing the re-runs starting from the first episode on AMC and playing them in order. After the first three episodes I was completely hooked. Best three episodes of TV I have ever seen. And it only gets more gripping from there. Watching this show is like watching something that could take place in real life in the third person. It is 100% realistic and makes you believe your neighbor or someone you know could be doing the same thing. The writers in the show are just so amazingly clever and unpredictable. Absolutely no clichés and magnificent story telling. Some of these so clever events I guarantee will make your jaw drop in awe. Of course the main character has two years to live so it is no mystery that he will die eventually. So you pretty you have a guy who decides, as the title suggests, to 'Break Bad'. Which pretty much means get as much money as possible manufacturing and selling crystal meth to support his wife, teenage son (who has cerebral palsy), and soon to-be daughter. His brother in-law works for the DEA also and is always one step away from catching Walt, which only adds to the tension.

So he teams up with a former low life student who has connections to get their product on the market. The relationship between him and this student is by far the most electric in the show. They are both EXCELLENT in this show and even more in their scenes together. There chemistry, no pun intended, is just perfect. The acting from the rest of the cast is just terrific also. Anyway, this show is one of the best, if not best shows EVER to air on television. Definitely my favorite. If you are looking for a show that will keep you engaged for the full 40 minutes, with few laughs, some top-notch drama, acting, scenarios, and unpredictability, this one is for you. Definitely give it a try if you have not seen it. You will be glad you did."
10.0,29 November 2012,"Breaking Bad is a series that could go into TV history books! Nothing from these days can top these series!

I watched seasons 1 till 5 in about 3 months. So the storyline is still fresh in my mind. It is remarkably how good the total fits together. There really aren't any gaps. In the beginning, it became already clear to me that this is going to be something good. Great acting off course, and a new kind of story we never heard before in a series. Also, the story felt extremely realistic. Mister Heisenberg, or Walt, had my compassion. I understood him with a little trying. But the story evolved quickly. Things became serious and Walt had to deal with more criminal facts than just cooking. But still Walt seemed to pull me to his side. Walt is a flexible character an changes gradually into a psychopath rather than be a family providing man.

Also, on the artistic view, the camera-work and editing was done great. It was not a simple drama series. There was a lot of attention to beautiful flashbacks and flash-forwards. Also the camera shoots often in a lot perspectives. And if you pay attention, the use of music is very accurate.

Lastly I would like to prize the series ability for not only be a standard drama, but also adding action and thriller or even horror at some times. The blood shedding is realistic. There isn't that much killing. And if somebody has been killed, there is a lot of attention payed to the disposal of the remains and processing the loss.

I would recommend this not standard high quality series to everyone! (Well, except kids)"
10.0,23 October 2019,"Season 1 is a masterpiece of storytelling and art. Yet from there, the show only gets more beautiful in its art and more dense with flawless writing. It has some of the greatest cinematography, editing, performances, writing, direction and set design. It is meticulous. Bryan Cranston gives the greatest performance ever on television. Likewise, Vince Gilligan provides the greatest storytelling ever on television, from his incomparable story structure, marvellous shot composition and movement, exemplary editing, thrilling dialogue and character studies, and an overall genius awareness of mine-en-scene and groundbreaking narrative. It is on the level of filmmaking as some of the greats in cinema. It is far beyond any other tv show, in every sense, and is about as perfect a television series as we're likely to ever see."
1.0,18 June 2021,"This show is a masterpiece,no need to say anything about this show just watch it and watch again."
10.0,8 April 2023,"I tried watching it because of how famous it is. The first episode was extremely slow for the first 20-25 minutes and when the actual stuff did start to happen, even then I couldn't stand the absolute slowness and cringe. I found myself pressing the forward button, skipping 10 seconds over and over again until I was finally able to complete the episode. I really did think it would get better but the second episode was just like the first one. They just kept acting out random scenes instead of following on the story. I was frustrated and quit it. The only good thing about this show is the prospect and potential it has.

Looking at the reviews, I know I'm the odd one out but I just had to say it."
10.0,8 June 2020,Man this show is too good. Bryan and Aaron did an incredible job and everything overall is just out of this world. Watch this and your life will instantly be better.
10.0,21 April 2021,Thanks to the entire team to giving this such a wonderful craft ..... Just awesome yo ... No words to say . The series will speak to you .

Already so much is written about it and believe me everything is true. It is one of few thing which will make you feel thankful that you are born a human being after 2008 so that you can enjoy it..

The show takes you on a ride that you will never Forget. The characters that will haunt you forever . you will compare every other show you watch with it and how it scores against breaking bad will be your new IMDb .

Sometimes I wish I hadn't watched it because you just won't enjoy anything after it."

10.0,9 January 2021,"I cannot stress enough how truly amazing this show really is. From all I have seen in GOT, to The Sopranos, to True Detective, to Ozark...... this remains at the very top. The one thing that this show has that none to the others have in my opinion is that constant consistency in writing and acting. The way they introduce the characters and shape them throughout 5 seasons is remarkable. The writing stays near perfect throughout the entire show, which is what put my closest contending show, Game of Thrones, at 2nd (those who have seen will know). There is never a dull moment or a moment where you feel like just bland dialogue or conversation isn't important to the plot. They take every aspect and detail in every area of the show and use it to the best capability. Along with great writing and top-notch acting (some of the best ever, including cinema) you get amazing scores and soundtracks which pull you in to the scene even more than you would think. Overall, this show I believe is and will remain the best show ever and is a must watch for any lover of great tv purely because every aspect imaginable is simply ~perfect~"
1.0,24 December 2021,Belive mee on my life.. Once u get attached to show after 1 season.. This is gonna be the most influential show of all time .. Just first 3-4 its hard to catch the grip so but think its boring. Stop watching. But once u r in. U ill be Brought to heaven.

8.0,11 March 2023,"Nothing will ever come close to this level ever again. I mean, just look at all the diluted trash the streaming services have to offer. Garbage. It's a downhill and it will only get worse (bar a few exceptions). Thankfully, we can re-watch masterpieces like this one...

Breaking Bad is still, to this day, unmatched in acting, storywriting and even camerawork. All the characters - including the ones you deeply despise - are being played perfectly and the actors get better with each passing season.

While I love them all, Dean Norris' acting won the show for me. The body language, the facial expressions, every little detail is just spot on. He is so fit for this role that it feels like he's actually Hank Schrader in real life."
10.0,29 October 2013,
8.0,13 December 2020,Best show with its plot and acting. Must watch series.
10.0,28 December 2020,It is the most amazing series in the world and there is no better than it
10.0,2 May 2020,Without any Bigbudget making how this come top on rating because the script was outstanding...i was thinking how GOT ends as pathetic and brba ending was the exact opposite...the best show ever..if you are watched it no other series will stand with this..
10.0,30 September 2016,"I watched this show after I saw that it was rated a 9.5 on here and I must say that I was not disappointed! Right from the first episode where Walter White (Bryan Cranston) was standing in his underwear pointing a gun at a non-existent enemy all the way to the final showdown that ended this addicting series, there was not a single episode where I wasn't glued to the screen.

The characters were brilliant and complex, and the actors who portrayed them were legendary. Not to mention that the show was very funny at times too! This series had everything from me clawing at my chair in anticipation of what was going to happen next to me cracking up laughing uncontrollably. If you're looking for a roller coaster that will leave you wanting more, this show is for you! For those like me who also want more, they have Better Call Saul now too!"
3.0,13 June 2020,"Only one word can define this show ""PERFECT"". there isn't any other show that we can compare with BrBd. Just a MASTERPIECE. From the very first episode I fell in love with it and the ending is far better than GOT or any other highly rated shows."
10.0,6 December 2013,"Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever made, and by one of the best shows ever made, I mean that it is in my top 5, albeit at the bottom. There is not a season that is disappointing, but when it comes to today's audiences, they are too quick to forget that Breaking Bad is not the only TV show that's ever existed.

The combined annoyance of both Skylar White and to an even more extreme extent, the always annoying Marie Schrader alone take away from a lot of the show. At times the both of them are just unbearable to put it simply. It seems today people are quick to point out that Breaking Bad is the best show ever, without ever have seen shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, Oz which essentially paved the way for Breaking Bad to ever exist."
10.0,13 December 2020,Still one of the best tv series with the best ending.
10.0,6 April 2022,"Whit out any doubt Breaking Bad is Masterpiece of all time!! Character development in this show is just incredible,story is amazing,dialogues and soundtracks are perfect and fit in the show. Just One word it's Masterpiece.just watch it."

You don't even need to know anything about the show to give it a chance. It's rated #1 all-time on IMDb's Fictional TV rankings, along with Game of Thrones, for a reason. If you give it that one, small, innocent chance to impress you, you will never look back and end up spending your days with your credit card out on AMC's breaking bad merchandise page to flaunt your unfaltering support for this Dramatic Masterpiece.

Tons of Emmys and Breaking Bad Addicts everywhere aren't wrong. I guarantee you"
10.0,30 July 2013,"Breaking bad has every single thing you could want on a show. It has a great plot, unbelievable acting, a ton of action, and some of the biggest bad-asses in TV history. It all starts with the great plot. It is a cool plot where it is so fun to find out whats going to happen next. Probably one of the most addicting shows ever. You can never get bored of breaking bad. You are going to never want to leave the TV. They take an innocent protagonist and turn him into the antagonist but at the same time you love him. It is cool to learn how awesome science can be. The acting is out of this world. I never in a million years thought the goofy Bryan Cranston could take on a serious role and play it better than i could imagine. I had only seen him on Malcolm in the Middle so when I saw him in the description I thought the show would be bad but i could have never been more wrong. Cranston acts out of this world. Aaron Paul shocked me so much. He did an even better job than Cranston. He puts so much emotion into the show. He plays his part perfectly, I could not imagine anyone else playing Jesse Pinkman. The action is out of this world. There are constantly explosions, gun shots, deaths, and much more throughout the show. It really adds great suspense to the show. I think Walter ""heisenberg"" White (Bryan Cranston) has taken on the role of the biggest bad-ass on TV. He has so many bad ass scenes. Ranging from cool lines to big explosions. Heisenberg has the intelligence of Michael Schofield (Wentworth Miller, Prison Break), he has the craziness of Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland, 24), and the pure awesomeness of Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson, Taken). If you have not seen this show than this is the show you have to watch right now. It is the best show on Television."

10.0,20 April 2024,"On some day, if extraterrestrial beings visited us and asked, ""What are your accomplishments, humans?""

We would put at the top of the list: music, football, and Breaking Bad.

Breaking Bad is the greatest work of art ever created by humans in all of human history. I expect it will remain this great work atop the global rating throne for the next hundred years.

""Breaking Bad"" is undoubtedly one of the greatest television works in the history of drama. The series is distinguished by its stunning storyline and brilliant screenplay, along with exceptional performances from the cast led by Bryan Cranston in the role of Walter White. The story portrays White's transformation from a quiet chemistry teacher to a methamphetamine drug lord, and how his personal life interacts with this new role. The series is interspersed with many thrilling dramatic moments and intriguing scenes that completely immerse viewers in its world. Additionally, ""Breaking Bad"" delivers a powerful message about deviating from the right path and its consequences, making it not just an entertaining series, but also a lesson in inner conflict and personal change. Simply put, it's an unforgettable series deserving of all praise and acclaim."

10.0,25 October 2012,"First I should say that I have watched the first four seasons and the first 5 episodes of the fifth season of the show. So I have pretty much watched nearly 90% of this TV series for now, so my review should be fairly representative of the overall quality of this TV series.

So, this is it people, the ultimate TV series. I never was more entertained for longer amounts of time than this TV series. It is indeed a unique TV series, delivering higher quality drama than 99% of the films in the cinemas and at larger doses. It represents the culmination of modern cable TV and shows indeed, that writers of TV shows are becoming more creative than the Hollywood film makers, who appear to lack any real ideas.

A TV series for those that like TV, but not for children: this is a quite graphic, violent and strong piece of audio visual entertainment."
10.0,4 August 2013,"This show is so real its content could easily be construed as too dangerous for TV but is by far the best action packed real to life show I've seen on television to date. I find myself enjoying every facet especially the brilliance behind the program that brought it into our homes where we could experience how normal law abiding citizens can become involved in illicit behavior to benefit loved ones. I enjoy the range of characters,the writer and producer have accurately depicted organized crime bosses to street corner meth heads all filling their place in this drug crazed world. As characters develop you realize business is business even in the drug world. As Walt climbs the corporate ladder you can't help but admire his ability to negotiate, interpolate, and take each new level in stride. Walt's heroic persona depicts strength at so many levels but an unyielding love for family , he ignores personal risk even his own values while focusing on building a financial empire for those he loves. His relationship with Jessie is in itself brilliant as he depicts a mentor, almost father like role yet conflicts and personality differences create one fine show! I applaud each who's taken part in seeing this show through fruition and hope you will enjoy benefits for a very long time. ""Thank you""!"
8.0,7 October 2021,"I am a latecomer to this show, but it certainly impressed me. The acting was pretty tight as it was well cast and the production and direction was top notch.

I liked the way it depicted the bleakness of the drug world and it's realism was first class. I have experienced the type of houses and dens that drug users use and had many friends who are almost identical to characters depicted in the show. The only reason I haven't given it a 10/10 is due to the sometimes gritty overexposure of the drug world. I'm not saying to conceal it, but some moments were truly painful to watch.

What I liked the most was the way it showed how drug abuse inadvertently impacts the lives of those around the users. The 'Jane' storyline resulting in her father's 'accident' is truly exceptional. How the lives of family members of drug dealers are affected was just as good.

Although we see the rise of Walter as he grows through the show, it really reminded me of Osymandias, Ramses the Great, and the poem by Shelley of the same name. I started off kinda liking the character and grew to slowly despise him, which is indicative of good writing as well great acting.

Other characters, like Jesse, Saul and Mike, you gather a deep empathy for, as they try to do the right thing whilst trying to stay alive in the midst of Walter's wrath.

There are some great comedic moments in the series as well, including the almost Looney Tune like episode with the fly in the lab.

Arguably one of the best series in recent years, but beware, some of the most hard to watch episodes depict a world some will not know. The episode with the ATM machine was pretty harrowing, but I have seen homes like this and they do exist.

If you haven't seen the show, I highly recommend it, but the ultra-realistic, if not hyper-realism, can be hard to watch, but this is why it makes it such a brilliant programme."
10.0,30 April 2020,"I liked the show, though I rushed it.. Still it rockzz"
10.0,28 September 2016,"Breaking Bad is not just a TV show. It is a masterpiece. 62 episodes of pure and intense drama, epic moments and incredible performances. Walter White, Jesse Pinkman...these 2 names will remain forever in our hearts. A regular chemistry teacher to turn into a drug dealer? Who believed that this is the premise for the greatest adventure? From the first to the last episode you can not predict what will happen next time. Is so unpredictable and you will enjoy it. This is the best you can see on TV. It clearly deserves the title of ""the best show ever made"".

As suggested it is quite interesting but it goes boring in season 3 and 4 but seasons 1,2 and 5 are really masterpieces through some of them are boring recommended for those you want everything in a show. Aoron Paul just rocks the show while Bryan Cranston maintains a decent appearance. The dialogue are good. Axting of actors is best. A great show with some twists here and there , humor jokes and with a some violence. I really enjoyed the show .I gave it only 9 stars because some of the episodes were boring."

Better than any movie aswell. I just can't describe how well developed the characters and the storyline is. I was never so addicted to a show and also never felt so much for the characters. It's just amazing to see Walt changing in this whole process. I really really recommend! I would give 20 if I could."

9.0,14 July 2023,"Everyone who has the slightest appreciation for the world of series knows that ""Breaking Bad"" is the best, or one of the best, series ever made, but why?

I will tell here just some of the reasons for this acclaim.

First, the characters and script are simply unbelievable. The way Vince Gilligan takes that Albuquerque desert and turns it into something alive and important to the story from beginning to end is wonderful. Another point of success are the plot twists that are insane, totally different from anything I've ever watched.

Ending, but not less important, this cast is out of this world. Each one is so amazing and really committed to acting without taking anyone's center stage. I can highlight Anna Gunn, Bryan Cranston (of course), Giancarlo Esposito and Aaron Paul, who made an extreme evolution of his performance from the first season to the end of the season, this maturation and growth is very cool to see."

10.0,26 October 2012,"I expect a lot from a TV-show to give it a 10/10-rating. However, this is one of those few TV-gems that deserves it. I don't want to ruin the experience for anyone, so I'll try to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible.

A few years ago, a friend of mine told me about this show. This was just after the second season had aired. I didn't really know what to expect when I started watching the pilot, but after 10 minutes I was already hooked! Every episode of Breaking Bad leaves you hungry for more. The suspense(?) continues throughout the series, and even though there are ""slower"" episodes here and there, you won't get bored.

One of the aspects I like most about Breaking Bad, is Walters struggle to keep living his double-life. When he walks out the door, he's a meth- cook, but at house he is a dad and husband. Bryan Cranston is amazing as Walter White, but also Aaron Paul(Jessie) and most of the other actors are incredible in their roles.

Breaking Bad is without doubt my favorite TV-show. In my opinion, TV can't be better than this. Check it out. You won't be disappointed :)"
10.0,12 June 2020,This show has the best use of colour I've ever seen. Visually it's fantastic. I can see the story they were trying to tell but honestly aside from Walt and Saul there wasn't a lot here for me.

9.0,9 April 2021,"Perfect. The show is perfect.

It has some very harsh subject matter that will be hard for some to watch. It's technically not for everyone in that regard, but the show itself is perfect.

The acting is flawless and I do mean that literally. The storyline has the most beautiful roller coaster of truly believable events that grab you and never let go. There are some moments that are so powerful they will move you on a level that you've never experienced before watching this show.

I seriously doubt another show will be better than this in my lifetime. I have watched the entire series several times and will definitely do so for a very long time.

Thank you Vince Gilligan. Seriously... thank you."
10.0,25 August 2020,Best TV drama series to date. From beginning to middle to end. Every single episode is a work of art. Emotional. Astonishing. Art.
10.0,27 March 2020,"This show. I have to say this is the closest I think I've ever seen a show or movie come to perfection. The acting is outstanding from every actor, even smaller characters, the writing is phenomenal (Vince Gilligan and the team are amazing). Even the cinematography is brilliant! The only problem is that it ends, but at least it didn't overstay it's welcome."

1.0,3 September 2020,"If i could give a different mark it would be 9.5; this series is really close to perfection. The only doubt I had was about the first two seasons, in these two the rhythm was a bit slow in certain episodes. By the way the casting is perfect, acting too, the plot is never boring and the character development is outstanding. Definitely the best tv series of 21st century if not the best show ever."
9.0,9 October 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is undoubtedly one of the greatest television shows ever created, and there are several reasons why it holds this esteemed title.

First and foremost, the writing and character development in ""Breaking Bad"" are unparalleled. Creator Vince Gilligan and his team crafted a storyline that is both intricate and emotionally gripping. The transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord is a masterclass in character evolution. Each character, no matter how minor, is given depth and complexity, making the viewer deeply invested in their fates.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of exceptional. His nuanced performance earned him multiple Emmy Awards, and he brought a level of depth to the character that is rarely seen on television. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is equally remarkable, creating a character who is simultaneously sympathetic and deeply flawed.

The show's cinematography and direction are top-notch, with breathtaking visuals and innovative camera work that adds to the storytelling. The use of symbolism and foreshadowing throughout the series keeps viewers engaged and encourages multiple viewings to catch every detail.

""Breaking Bad"" also tackles profound themes such as morality, the consequences of one's choices, and the nature of power and corruption. It prompts viewers to question their own ethical boundaries and the lengths they would go to in desperate circumstances.

In addition to its artistic merits, ""Breaking Bad"" was a cultural phenomenon that ignited discussions and debates among viewers worldwide. It pushed the boundaries of what television could achieve and set a new standard for quality storytelling.

In summary, ""Breaking Bad"" stands as a testament to the power of television as an art form. Its exceptional writing, performances, and exploration of profound themes make it a show that will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come."

10.0,13 June 2020,"I just rewatched this serie after 5 years. And i would never take the time to watch a serie twice, but this one just gets better and better. It left me speechless, and after the final episode i was staring into a void. How can humans create such masterpiece? A lot of people around me dropped out and didn't finish all seasons because, according to them, it got a bit lenghty and 'repetitive'.. God i'm glad i'm not one of them. The last season is the best drama i've ever seen on TV. When Hank finds out about Walt, it's the most emotional rollercoaster i've ever experienced on screen. Do yourself a favor and watch it, you will most likely be one of those guys like me, who are receptive to this show and will love it more than anything ever written!

10.0,18 March 2023,"I have to say that Breaking Bad is a show that blew me away. From start to finish, the series was gripping, intense, and emotionally charged.

The character development in the show is unparalleled. Walter White's transformation from a mild-mannered high school teacher to a drug kingpin was masterfully portrayed by Bryan Cranston. He made you believe that a man could go from a sympathetic character to someone you would loathe and fear.

The show's supporting cast was also excellent. Aaron Paul gave a standout performance as Jesse Pinkman, capturing his character's mix of desperation and loyalty. The show also had an incredible supporting cast, including Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, Anna Gunn as Skyler White, and Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring.

But what sets Breaking Bad apart from other shows is the writing. The series was expertly crafted, with each season building on the one before it. The story was full of twists and turns, but everything made sense in the end. The show also tackled some weighty themes, including family, loyalty, and the price of ambition.

In short, Breaking Bad is a show that I would highly recommend to anyone. It's a masterpiece of television that will leave you thinking about it long after you've finished watching."
1.0,16 July 2021,"This is the concept of art!!! Everything is perfect, Suck that GOT..."
10.0,18 May 2020,"At first, I didn't want to watch it and all. Then, I got persuaded to watch it. After a couple of episodes, I started to like it.

It had comedies, songs, some actions, cool scenes, etc.

Definitely worth the watch! I sometimes feel like I should have watched Better Call Saul first since the timeline is different and all.

Then again, it doesn't matter because both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are good and funny!

Check them out!"
10.0,30 May 2019,"I never see stupid boring story like this , and it what the most wasting time of my life"
10.0,12 May 2020,"Series starts off a bit slowly , But if you watch it with patience you will feel the real essence of BREAKING BAD ."
10.0,25 August 2021,"Some three years after finishing Breaking Bad, I am looking for a new show to watch. And in searching for recommendations, I am often prompted to answer the question ""What kind of show are you looking for?"". I want intricacy, suspense and drama. I want good writing & even better acting. I want memories that will live with me forever. I want Breaking Bad. Few things come close, because the bar was set so high by Heisenberg, Saul Goodman & co. Bravo!!"
10.0,12 February 2020,I was getting a super burrito and this was on in the background on TV . I had no idea what they were saying but I could tell the show was good. Got home and put it on in English and I could not stop watching it.
10.0,9 May 2020,"""Breaking Bad"". What an unbelievable show.

Great writing. Great filmmaking. Great acting.

This was so well done all around. I would give it a 10/10 but it's not fully there for me to be a full 10/10........

you know what no. I have no downsides on the top of my mind. So, I'm going to change it to a 10/10.

Thank you for making such a gem."
10.0,16 July 2021,"The best series ever made, the best in every way, great director, great actors, everything is in the right place."
10.0,8 April 2022,"When I was thinking about how much I appreciated this show, I simply couldn't come up with less than 10/10. The writing was amazing, each character had his own place and development, the casting was beyond doubt impeccable. The tension escalated with every new season and in the meantime, I've developed genuine sympathy for the whole Walt's family, including Jesse.

Story about a decent guy breaking bad while abruptly peddling dope ended up being very addictive. I consumed it, or perhaps I was consumed, quickly and with the utmost pleasure.

I recommend you do the same!"
2.0,26 August 2020,"If you like action, drama, comedy (""Yeah Bi***!""), and so much more you need to watch this. The performance of Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul are perfect something you will really enjoy. Also has the perfect ending."

10.0,6 February 2021,It's super boring. Nothing happens. Even the punch and sudden thrills are way below the expectations
10.0,10 February 2016,"This is one of the best TV shows ever made in the history of television industry encompassing all genres. Although, this TV show has a lot of crime and drama, some of its dialogues make you laugh more than most of the comedy series in the television industry. Every episode is unique and interesting in this five series TV show. The story moves at a very natural and realistic speed. This is one of the best works by Vince Gilligan till date. Everyone did superb acting especially Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Superb dialogues, amazing story and excellent acting make this the best drama TV show.

A must watch for all!"
9.0,21 February 2016,"Awesome simply awesome. Its the only TV series that I watched twice. The story line is so well built up. The action direction screenplay all top notch. It does not have any super hero kinda thing or something like that but, still the intensity it creates is hands down. While watching it you feel like that these things can actually happen with you. At first u feel like its some boring kinda story but, as u keep watching through all the episodes u simply start loving them. Wow a 10/10 from me. And please a request from me to the producers. Please don't even think of producing a season 6. Its a classic and has the perfect ending for me"
10.0,9 April 2022,"Not only does this serie contain a great story and has well thought out characters. It also keeps you on the edge of you're seat.

All of the characters have there own emotions, reactions, responses and ideas."
10.0,15 June 2010,"The third season has came to end, and all I can say, this is the best I saw so far! The only show I watched beside Breaking Bad and had such a crushing storyline was Lost - but they messed it up ... Anyway, I can hardly wait the 4th season to start, till now it has wonderful characteristics with magnificent acting, great storyline, outstanding photography and a good direction. Recommended to everybody, who'd like to watch an exciting, animated show, with lifelike and rough-and-ready situations and turns.

The only reason I give a 9 out of 10, because this is not yet completed, not yet a finished story, but as the time passes, it gets closer and closer to it...

Outstanding show.

9/10."
10.0,12 February 2021,QUARANTINE made me finally watch breaking bad And it was Definitely one of my best decision.
10.0,16 December 2020,"I was 18 when i started to watch TV series...I thought it was too waste of time so i prefered movies...My best friend said to me ""Just give a chance and you will not regret it""...One of the best decisions of my life...This show is far from great,phenomenal,amazing is something more is a word that dont even exist...What can you say...the perfomances of Bryan Cranston(mostly)and Aaron Paul...all the secondary roles that are also amazing...the writing and production of the ""Mad Genius"" Vince Gilligan...Bryan Cranston maybe deliver us the best perfomances the world has ever seen...And Ozymadias men...Dude that was the best hour of my life and i believe for so many lucky people who had witness that episode...So my opinion is...DONT watch this show first,cause all the shows you gonna see in the future is gonna be garbages in front of this Legendary show"
1.0,22 August 2021,"Breaking Bad has tallied up over 1.5m scores and 3,903 reviews to date, so why even bother adding one more? After all, the arithmetic mean score is 9.3 and the Median is a straight up 10, so what more can be added?

As I am embarrassingly late to the party (I only heard of the series earlier earlier this year, a bit of a faux pas) and had to binge my way through it, I thought I'd try to add two dimensions not already covered. Yes it's a ten. Yes its addictive. Yes its unprecedented ...tick all the boxes and ditto all that's said before, but I believe the following two observations add value to the extensive review of the most valuable TV drama I've ever seen.

The first is how it plays with your attention. I can draw a parable from music, where we've seen adoption of streaming drive two changes: first songs are getting shorter; second songwriters are moving the chorus to the front. Why? Because you only get paid when you get played for more than 30 seconds and you don't get paid a second more for lasting a second more - so canny songwriters write shorter and catchier songs. This is covered in more depth in my book Tarzan Economics. I see a similar play so that we pay attention during the opening sequences of Breaking Bad, bringing the climax to the front to make sure you stay the course. Attention is scarce, we all want more of it meaning something has to give. The Breaking Bad series successfully won over almost two solid days of attention (or just over 47 hours), when most podcasts can't command half an hour and most songs can't get past three minutes. We should appreciate the introduction sequences which made this possible. So much so, it was possible then (pre-iPhone), and it's still possible now.

The second is how it plays with our imagination. I'm thinking specifically about Los Pollos Hermanos, a fried chicken fast food restaurant which functions as a front organisation for Gus Fring's meth operation. Numerous other reviews have acknowledged how well Gus is portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito, and the way he can deliver an unforgettable scene without even delivering an expression - the deadpan stare becomes the default. Nevertheless, I want to acknowledge the support actors in Los Pollos Hermanos - the customers, waitresses, kitchen staff - as they make you wonder how many diners you've been to which are a similar 'front' for bad behaviour. Where things seem just too normal. Where the takings at the till don't seem to add up given the known costs of running the store. These support actors are the unsung heroes which drop you deeper into Fring's underground world - they act like they're not even trying.

There's my two cents to add to the 3,903 cents already added - hopefully I'm breaking new bread with these observations, and you find them helpful. My thanks to the writers, cast and crew which made this 47 hour binge marathon worth every minute. Time to 'cook' a sequel!"
10.0,18 September 2022,"The modern day version of The Sopranos would be Breaking Bad. If Citizen Kane was a TV show, it would be Breaking Bad. If the Mona Lisa was made into television, it would be Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad is not an ordinary show. It is art. It is a masterpiece. It is the reason why half of my family is addicted to meth. I love this show so much that I could not describe it in words, but rather, I should describe it in numbers: 83748392928474820293747473920485782919484777492928347

You can imagine and interpret as much as you want about what that entire string of numbers is supposed to mean, but all I am allowed to say is that it translates to Breaking Bad being a stunning piece of modern cinema. Thank you, Vince Gilligan, for blessing this Earth with the magnum opus of all television, that is Breaking Bad."

10.0,24 August 2023,"I have watched breaking bad twice now and all i can say is that its perfection. I believe that no other show is on the level of this masterpiece. From beginning to end i was hooked. Every day after watching an episode i would just be so excited to watch the next one the next day. But breaking bad can be slow for some people... it takes time to adjust to the long episodes but once you finish that first season it becomes addictive. Would 100 per cent recommend it to every youngster. I have shared it with some of my friends and we still talk about that show to this day! Before watching bb i recommend watching ""better call saul"" which is an equally good show , and after watching bb you should finish it with the sequel ""el camino"""
10.0,18 June 2017,"this one is the best

i watch already 10+ shows but this is something different

that story between Jesse and Walter is amazing also TV show with amazing cameras like POV etc. and one of the best soundtrack in TV show too

Walter character development is just on the other level from chemistry teacher to King of the Kings :)

the fifth season is the best seasons of every TV shows

sometimes i was bored at the breakfast but then is totally worth it :)

11/10 MASTERPIECE

10.0,23 August 2022,"When I watched, I was amazed because of the high rating, and the ceiling of ambitions was high, but when I watched the work, I was shocked how boring and weak and few events are suitable for watching. It took 3 months to complete it. It is weak and does not deserve a high rating."
10.0,13 December 2020,"Plot twist:IT ISN'T!.Breaking Bad is more like a journey,an expirience than a show.Walter is the definition of the undiscovered genius.At first the show seemed ok,but after the first season I really realized that I care about this more and more.Now i just finished it and i can say that it is hyped for a god damn reason.This is the best show,movie,story etc that I have ever seen and I would watch it forever. The end really got me speechless and I'm quite sad when I'm thinking how will be my life without this series That's an easy 10/10(before this i thought there is no perfection on this planet,but this is on a whole new level)"
10.0,8 September 2013,"I have been a fan of this show since it started. For many years I thought that ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" was the best and grittiest crime drama I'd ever seen - until ""Breaking Bad"" appeared. The acting and writing has been terrific from season one right up to now. Bryan Cranston just stuns me, because I still remember him as the moronic father in ""Malcolm in the Middle."" However, the entire cast is great. Walter White's transformation over the years is one of the best character developments I've ever seen in more than fifty years of watching TV. The intensity of the show is such that I wind up watching it on demand because my wife can't deal with the ruthlessness of the principal characters, and the basic theme. It is well worth the day's wait to catch it the next day. I will be sorry to see one of television's all-time great shows, of any format, wind up after this season."
10.0,15 August 2021,"I have watched it 5 time all by myself. Later I convinced my partner to watch and she somehow managed to watch it 2 times already. I'll probably watch it again 1-2 times before watching it with my child again a few times in the coming years.

Hands down the best series ever created. The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be!!"
10.0,1 June 2021,All time best series with less cast and more curiosity. Main credit goes to the director who make us sit at the corner seat and watch the whole series .Acting of the both partners and thier dialogues are out of the world. Its worth watching series🔥🔥
10.0,11 October 2011,"This show is simply the most captivating series I have ever watched. For the the past several years Dexter has been the only show on TV that held my interest from week to week......until now! I watched the first 3 seasons in a matter of days. I have become totally invested in the main characters, and am amazed at the chemistry between the cast members. It's refreshing to finally see a show that allows Bryan Cranston to use his skills to full potential. The man is a superb actor. Needless to say, Walt (Cranston) is my favorite character on the show. Coming in at a close second is Dean Norris, as Hank. Once again, a tremendous acting job. His character, along with Bob Odenkirk's character, Saul Goodman, provide much of the comedy relief. Speaking of Bob Odenkirk, it's good to see him thriving in this role as the ""dirty lawyer"". At first Saul seems like a simple comedic character, but as the show progresses, different sides of Saul are revealed. If you are looking for a good show to start watching, WATCH BREAKING BAD!"
10.0,22 July 2021,"Best series ever , if you didn't watch it what are you doing ? Go watch it now !🔥"
10.0,30 August 2020,"This is the greatest show from start to finish to hit television, it truly is the masterpiece fans make it out to be."
2.0,10 December 2020,"This series is amazing. I watched it twice. The plot is great and it makes you watch the series to the end.

The lentgh of the film is very ok, they didn't stretch it like other films (eg. Prison Break).

Overall: Best film series I've ever watched"
10.0,26 May 2019,There is many mistakes in the story and there is boring and boring and boring and there is many episodes is bad like the fly episode what's that that show !!
10.0,18 August 2023,"I used to be one of those people who ""never watched the popular shows"". My friend forced me to watch the first episode of Breaking Bad, of course I've heard of it but refused to watch it because it didn't make sense to me. How could a show about a teacher who has cancer and makes meth be that good? Oh how I was wrong. It really is that good, I was hooked to my TV screen like I was the one with a drug addiction. There's just something about this show that's so real and so incredibly emotional. I have never experienced a show that good at conveying itself and that is why Breaking Bad will be timeless and enjoyed by all kinds of people. The casting is the best casting I have ever seen, every actor and actress, no matter how small their part was incredible. Their acting is so natural and believable, from Walter himself to Gustavo Fring to Saul Goodman to Jesse Pinkman, you just get transported into their world. And despite knowing that Walter and Jesse are in the wrong, you can't help but feel sorry for the both of them."
10.0,31 March 2022,"Vince Gilligan is basically THE man.

He has written, in my opinion, the best story ever committed to film. The sheer brilliance of the writing takes you on a journey that has no peers. Someone said to me that the story was preposterous and they didn't enjoy it. I agree that in the UK it would be seriously far-fetched. But set in the crazy, expansive world of the United States it is perfectly plausible.

The excellent character arcs, interrelationships and plot developments are written with such depth and imagination that it's almost impossible not to enjoy. It grabs hold of you like a vice and, even on second viewing when you know what's coming, takes you away to another world.

Gilligan, with the help of an incredible cast, maintains a pressure cooker of suspense throughout the entire 5 seasons, delivering cliffhanger after cliffhanger. It's incomparable to anything else I've ever seen because of this perpetual tension, glorious unpredictability and drama of the highest order.

It's escapism on a whole other level and as addictive as the high-grade methamphetamine Walt and Jesse cook.

Televisual perfection."
10.0,21 March 2012,"this is a well made series so far there are only 4 series and do not know if there will be any more

well watching this series was great did not expect it , it got a low viewing rate because i think it was not as commercial as other but its one of them when you watch it , you want to see it till the end

Bryan Cranston is the main character who is the dad in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE , and he was the best thing about MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE and he is a true actor in this series and is very entertaining to watch , this series has a great ending

the way its been shot with the camera is nice and there is some cg work as well that looks good

i would like to say much more about this series as there is a lot to say but its best to see it for your self , what can i say but its well put together in my opinion"

9.0,27 April 2020,"It's 2020 so yeah, I'm late.

But guess what, I can safely say that besides some pace awkwardness here and there, mostly in the first two seasons I dare to say...it's way better than Game of Thrones.

There I said it.

Watch it and make your own opinion, I did it and I made it. Highly recommended."
10.0,8 July 2021,"Before I watched this show I thought it would be full of science and I wouldn't really understand wtf was going on but one day I gave it a watch and I was not disappointed it is a very smart show, and the ending was was brilliant, couldn't have asked for a better crime drama show."
5.0,30 April 2020,If you watch this you will never enjoy other series again. Its the best ever
10.0,26 August 2021,"Hello Vince. Thank you.

I loved this movie to bits. Every episode is just perfect."
10.0,22 August 2023,"It's a great series upto season 2, then they just began make episodes without any originality. Plot was ridiculous on some episodes like Se3 Ep10: Fly.

I learned that the character of Jesse was originally planned to cut off by ep9 or so. I guess keeping him was a mistake as he contributed to silly story line.

After first 2 seasons, I felt that the element of intelligence was missing. I felt that they were just making it to keep running the series without giving much thought to the storyline, making it less intelligent, that's when I completely lost the interest of this series.

It was really good for the first part, only the part was bad."
10.0,10 June 2021,"(GOT coming in close second)

10.0,15 July 2013,"I have just finished watching Season 4 in what I can only describe as the best TV show I've ever watched. I believe Season 5 begins in a few weeks time and my excitement for that is through the roof! If it manages to continue with the same, mind-blowingly powerful standards in Seasons 1,2,3,4 and 5 then I don't see what's stopping Breaking Bad from becoming one of THE BEST television programmes EVER. I like everything about BB; the characters are masterfully sculpted and you can sympathise and empathise with the majority, the plot and story line of each episode is the finest I have ever witnessed and the way that the programme starts and finishes fills you with intrigue and anticipation for the forthcoming episode or next episode since most end on a cliff- hanger and begin with a weird pink bear which builds up your interest and is most puzzling until you find out about it later on. Overall, I feel words can not describe Breaking Bad's brilliance fully. NO SHOW COMPARES TO THIS."
10.0,22 May 2020,What more needs to be said? A must watch for everyone.
10.0,9 August 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is an exceptional TV series that truly redefines what television can be. The story of a high school chemistry teacher who turns to manufacturing methamphetamine after a cancer diagnosis is both intense and riveting. The show expertly weaves complex characters and intricate plotlines, making every episode engaging and thought-provoking. The character development is top-notch, and the unexpected twists keep you on the edge of your seat. With outstanding writing, superb acting, and a gripping narrative, ""Breaking Bad"" is a must-watch for anyone who values high-quality television. I just love it."
10.0,9 September 2020,"This web series became my love, my family, my daily routine, I never wanted this series to end. Please someone request the makers to continue the series plss😭😭😭😭❤❤💯💯"
9.0,25 October 2011,"Breaking Bad ""cooks"" like a great show. Cooking is a term you will come to know from Breaking Bad. The main character played by Bryan Cranston (Malcom in the Middle, Clerks) is amazing as Walter White. Bryan pulls off his dynamic character well.

This show is emotionally engaging on a large scale. It entertains jocks, nerds, gangstas, lovers and loners.

The most intriguing thing about this show is the script. It's explosive but to make it even better the cinematography shines bright! The beauty of the Mexico bordered south is jaw dropping here.

None of us can grasp what they have went through to make this show, on such a low budget and such low viewer ship. The producers, actors, and directors, and more poured their blood, sweat, and tears into making this show I'm sure.

Breaking Bad is as original as it is beautiful.

Go watch this now!"
1.0,9 June 2020,"The nights I stayed up to watch this magnificent show, during the stress of my exams. Breaking Bad just keeps you hooked onto it and can't wait to find out what happens next. it is a slow start, but the build up is extremely worth it so have patience with the show. Bryan Cranston (Walter White), there couldn't have been a better Walter White than him. he has nailed his role to perfection and develops a lot throughout the show. Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) is by far the undisputed best actor of this show, he may not seem as important as Walter, but he too nails his role. The likes of Bob Odenkirk (Saul Goodman), Giancarlo Esposito (Gustavo Fring), Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmantraut), Anna Gunn (Skyler White), Dean Jones (Hank Schrader) and RJ Mitte ( Walt Jr.) have also excelled in their position of expertise. THERE WILL NEVER BE A SHOW LIKE BREAKING BAD. EVER."
8.0,22 December 2022,"If you want to watch this series right now, you probably saw how much it was praised from morning to night. This inevitably pushes people away. It causes an approach with prejudice. And if you're not an American, if you know how easy it is for Americans to have fun, you probably thought that this show wasn't as good as they say. I thought so too. But I was wrong.

Breaking Bad is a great series in all circumstances. It's beyond awesome. It contains every factor that a series needs at the highest level, in such a way as to be an example for other series. First of all, I want to talk about the story and there is no prominent factor in the story. Everything is so beautiful. Written characters, excitement of events, surprises. The story is meticulously written and every scene manages to make you feel this care. There are some unrealistic situations, yes, but the story is so good that you forget about them. At least I forgot. But please don't get spoilers from this old drama. Although the spoilers reveal unexpected things, watching the same scenes with almost the same excitement shows how perfect the series is.

The series has been revolutionary in terms of cinematography, even though I don't understand it much. Sometimes you want to get bored of serials and pick up the phone. There are no such places in this series. Especially, it didn't bother even someone who got bored quickly like me and watched TV shows by taking the speed to 2x. I even rewinded some scenes and watched them at normal speed. Just when you get bored, the scene starts to be shot from a very different place. It's as if they asked millions of people where they wanted to watch and acted according to the answers. Also, despite being old, I haven't seen any of the video effects grin. Simply great. I don't think I have the right to talk much about music and sound, but I have the Bonfire scene in mind. And a short generic music that will never leave my mind. Even two permanent music releases is a success for a drama, I think.

Finally, the acting that I think no one will argue with. Is it possible for all the actors in a drama to play great? Yes, according to this series. Everyone, from the player in the corner to the leading role, has given a leading performance. I think that the fact that each of these actors, who not only did not grin but also showed memorable performances, scraped a few scenes in our heads, shows how well they acted.

The best series I've ever watched. It's not even a matter of discussion. The series has done works that can set an example for others in every field and exceed the boundaries of the sector. I don't think there is anyone who wouldn't like it."
10.0,13 October 2020,"Saying that this show is overrated is an understatement. First two seasons are just a slow burn, boring drama even worse than the worst TV shows. Then there's people bragging about it's successive seasons. Tried myself and it wasnt as per my expectations. Many other shows are better than this overhyped piece of cr#p like narcos, the boys, even animes. Death note is far more entertaining and gripping than this show"

10.0,24 May 2020,"Having watched the first four seasons, my take is that ""Breaking Bad"" is a fairy tale about a chemist who gets cancer and then starts cooking drugs to pay for his treatment. Acting and shooting is good and the show is entertaining but it has major plausibility issues. If you have enjoyed ""Better Call Saul"" and don't mind some large logical gaps in the plot, you may like this one too."

10.0,10 October 2015,"This was my first English show and i totally loved it i am writing this because i really appreciate it. All i want to do is to give huge round of applause.""Breaking Bad"" is the best television show. Ever. This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of Grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines. Get on your couch now and start watching ""Breaking Bad"" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before"
10.0,28 May 2021,"I am not a huge fan of crime dramas and started watching this on a whim. This series still managed to keep me hooked for it's entire run.

EVeryone here has talked about story, characters and suspense which were great. Another thing I liked was the visual storytelling."
10.0,7 January 2021,Watched it the third time and obviously with the same enthusiasm as the first time. G.O.A.T
10.0,6 April 2022,"I have never been more engaged, focused and in love with anything as much as this is entertainment brings breaking bad being my favorite in every category. Although I don't watch it on repeat my first time watching this show made me feel alive happy sad confused and entertained the entire time. Every episode had me wanting to watch the next. Unbelievable characters, story telling, Cinematics and the incredible journey of the main character Walter white. This show makes me want to go back and watch it like it was my first time. As I know I can't do that I am still loving the memories I had watching it. My expectations met my standards and this show always had me on the edge of my seat. Thank you Vince and everyone in breaking bad for changing the film industry."
1.0,21 September 2016,"I got to know about the show through my friend but it sounded pretty much alright! I mean a professor who cooks meth doesn't sound all that awesome, but once I got through the first season, OMG! it just got me hooked up to it. The casting is excellent and there is justice done to each and every character in this show. The transformation of Walter White to Heseingberg is totally worth a watch. Apart from that the supporting characters of Jesse Pinkman, Skyler, Hank and Saul Goodman are excellently developed. I have got know that a show on Saul Goodman has been released and I just cannot wait to watch that thing after an amazing Breaking Bad experience. It definitely is one of the best TV shows till date!"

10.0,25 September 2020,"Achieves decibel-splitting peaks in craftsmanship. The first season grabs us by the end with an intervention that foreshadows the decimating heartbreak Walt will lay on his family. The pace picks up assuredly, all the while forming a high contrast, idiosyncratically Albuquerquian hellscape. A complete and utter deconstruction. Gilligan, Cranston, Paul, Gunn, Esposito, Norris, and Banks all exude astonishing work."
10.0,25 June 2013,"The underground world of illegal narcotics has never been displayed in such a captivating, elaborate fashion. Breaking Bad does an excellent job of taking you on a journey. A journey of one man's downward spiral into the methamphetamine world.

The story is captivating and intriguing. The gradual progression of the characters is believable and wildly exciting. There is rarely a dull moment in Breaking Bad. There may be some more seemingly calm moments, but the way that the story unfolds always leaves tension in the air.

Not only is the story incredible, the cinematic vision is some of the best I have ever seen. The transitions are so smooth and clever. Situations where someone stands up from a couch in one room and sits down in another seamlessly, or a vacuum is heard in a room and the same seemingly obnoxious sound changes unknowingly to a car wash without the viewer noticing happens regularly. Kudos to the transition guys for sure!

All in all, Breaking Bad is a terrible story that somehow pulls in and holds the viewer in a suspension of pure awesome. If you have not started watching it, then what are you doing here still reading this review. GO. Watch it. Now.

You're still here? This review is over...GO!"
10.0,24 December 2014,"well, I am new to American TV serials. Watching this was tough as the sequences shot are really long and the story moves at a slower pace, but as the serial approaches the final season it just compensates everything... the ending was just fabulous... watch it for its ending, it deserves that...

Every episode starts with a prologue, which actually obliges you to think, and as the story towards the end, they drop a clue for the upcoming serial which again makes you say, DAMN IT, LET ME HIT THE NEXT ONE NOW...

The way they have blended the chemistry aesthetics in the whole plot is really adorable, which is easily understood.

Overall, if u like suspense and those swanky tricks and turns in the story, then this one is for you. But... you've gotta wait for it... ;)"
10.0,23 August 2015,"Breaking bad is The greatest show ever created. Perfection in every detail. It's an experience of great cinematographic art and character development. The intensity and drama will ensnare you. Yet the black comedy will make you laugh. This show is all it could be and will stand in history as one of the most amazing TV-series ever made.

And the cast... Never forget the cast. Every actor and actress fills their parts with great success! With the great Bryan Cranston in the role of his life.

The show was perfect, all bad things must come to an end. And what an end.

I think the only bad thing in breaking bad is it has an end , i'd never like to stop watching this masterpiece ."
10.0,9 January 2021,"Yes, it's true, this show really is special, and the hype is justified. I never wanted to watch it because shows about drugs don't interest me. But eventually curiosity about all the hype got to me and I started the first episode. Was totally hooked. Wow, what else can be said about this iconic TV phenomenon."
9.0,21 April 2020,"I wish I could forget this show and watch it all over again without knowing what will happen. It just hits differently than any other show. Everything is perfect: cinematography, the screenwriting, direction, production, the acting. And yeah believe the hype because this is the best show out there. There will never be a show as good as this one. We'll never get another Breaking Bad"
1.0,22 June 2021,"The show is the absolute definition of legendary.

Every single bit of this show is fantastic and iconic, although it took me a little over a month, you can watch it in a week."
10.0,20 September 2019,"Using an ancient theme we are treated to the same old story that dates back to Macbeth and the Greeks. It's an old tired story. Hollywood continually dishes out terrible content such as this and we eat it up. And that in itself is nothing new. This show makes you appreciate other truly unique TV shows by showing how great it is, but how old and stolen the theme has become."
10.0,26 December 2009,
10.0,23 August 2021,"This show, at its worst, is better than the best episode of most other television dramas. Ozymandias, Felina, and most of the episodes throughout the third to fifth seasons are brilliantly crafted works of art. The attention to detail is incredible. Absolutely flawless. Just stop reading my review and go watch it. NOW!"
10.0,28 July 2021,"I've never met a single person who've disliked this show. And I'm not suprised. It's almost impossible to dislike it. It's perfect in every way, and you won't regret watching it."
10.0,5 September 2012,"I'm not one to get all melodramatic over a television show, I can't stand people who do it, but this show seriously cannot be rated high enough. The brilliant mix of A-grade acting, top-notch writing, suspense, humour, twists, photography and soundtrack is something that will keep fans of any genre entertained.

The change that comes over Walt's face when he turns from mild-mannered chemistry teacher to Heisenberg, the all-conquering drug manufacturing king-pin is remarkable when accompanied by that little head-tilt. You want to see a drug-manufacturer lose, but you want Walt to win.

I could go on about the show, but nothing I say could do it justice. Just watch it, there is literally no way you will regret it."
10.0,7 October 2015,
10.0,4 April 2011,"OK, so when I see a critic give a movie 4 stars, I immediately say, yeah right - because the hype, the type of movie a critic considers to be 4 stars is many times not the same kind of movie a person looking for something great would consider 4 stars. Reviewers and moviegoers are worlds apart on taste.

Now, I give Breaking Bad 10 out of 10 yes. But it isn't for everyone. Watch the pilot. And then, if you can stay with it, and watch the next and the next, I am almost confident it will completely grab hold of you and a show about a lowly chemistry teacher turned meth cooker will become your drug of choice - I swear - but that's only if it grabs you.

The base scenario: Chemistry Teacher, who had aspirations for bigger things stuck in marriage to controlling wife with son who has Cerebral Paulsy and wife also baby on way. Brother in law works for the DEA. Chem teacher finds out he has terminal lung cancer and after finding out from DEA bro-in-law the huge money involved in cooking meth, decides to get into it to provide for family after his death (secretly of course).

It's 3 seasons old with a 4th season due in July 2011 and it has only gotten better season by season. It is amazing, gripping, disgusting, upsetting, emotional, slick, pathetic, scary, adrenalizing...and a bunch of other words - all in one shot.

The reason? The acting and writing. These two things make Breaking Bad the best show I've ever seen on TV. The acting is so freaking' good. Also, the writing isn't just what you're seeing on screen. It goes deeper than that. The way the actors execute bring the writing to levels unheard of in TV.

Fans of Dexter or Six Feet Under will want to try this one out. Even if you're not, give it a try and maybe you'll like it. Me? I'm a nut case about the show so I'll say try it no matter what you're a fan of."
1.0,22 April 2021,"The pinnacle of prestige television. It's a complete and coherent story with no wasted space (that I can recall) and every episode has you tearing your hair out in a good way. Without giving anything away, the way they shifted the viewer's feelings about the characters over the course of the series is gradual and masterful."
10.0,29 March 2024,"From season 1 to five, everything is perfect. The caracter arcs, the writing, the plot line, just perfect. I've watched the show multiple times and it never disappoints. There is always something going on and the show never bores you. My favourite character is Jesse and his character development is out of this world. There is Walt, Saul, Mike, Hank, Gus, Skyler, Marie, Todd,... And every one of them are perfecty written, have a place in the intrigue of the show, are fluently introduced to us, the spectators and the acting is just other-worldly. To conclude my review, I recommend the show strongly and it deserves the 9.5 rating it has on IMBD. It's the greatest of all times."
10.0,30 October 2021,"Brba is Worthless series one.

1.0,9 January 2019,"Vince Gilligan's ""Breaking Bad"" represents how deep and powerful character study and storytelling can be. There is not a single flaw with the show. Its superb script, accompanied by some of the most convincing and haunting performances from its incredible cast. ""Breaking Bad"" is also fairly short, compared to other successful shows on television. It had balls to end at its best, where other accomplished TV series would not. The wild character of Walter White is impeccable, his grand intelligence is constantly portrayed brilliantly by Bryan Cranston. White slowly evolves into a completely different individual, one that his old self would fear. BrBa is most definitely a piece of modern art that everyone should experience."

10.0,28 January 2017,"What an epic TV series!. Best TV shows ever!. I really lovely this TV series!.

I seen a lot of series, and this is one of the best!. I never like so many characters in a TV series, only in this TV series!. They really build deep strong character! And not only to the leading actor but as well as to the supporting actor and actress!. I enjoy to watch partnership and friendship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman.

The cast that I love: Walter White: Jesse Pinkman Hank Schader Saul Goodman

I seen a lot of movies and series since the year 2004. Bottom line, this TV series is the most epic TV series that i ever seen in my entire life!."

10.0,27 January 2022,This show is incredible and undoubtedly one of the best. The character arcs are amongst the best I have ever seen and I seen alot if movie. This gritty drama isnot for kids but i would highly recommend for anyone else.
10.0,10 August 2017,"Breaking Bad begins as a gory and short-scripted plot with not much wiggle room, and by season 2 will have you hooked like a blow-fish on its bait on endless plot-twists and innumerable synchrinistic situations that include the dynamic interaction of all actors equally intertwined with the plot itself.

Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Dean Norris are nothing short of pheonominally sharp in their roles. The acting is fantastic. The plot is unique, intriguing, and nonetheless extremely entertaining despite the x-rated gore of blood guts rarely depicted in any series comparable.

Having only watched slightly under half of the series so far, it's hard to give much more input, but I still felt compelled to write a review on my behalf of my enjoyment so far. It is definitely a recommend choice of mine for netflix or as a series in general."
10.0,26 September 2020,This show is so good. Its just that simple. It beutifully documents a mans journey to insanity. An absolute must watch.
10.0,22 February 2022,"This is one series that totally depressed me when it was over-no tv show has ever captured my attention like this one. You get SO invested in the characters and their troubles and personal lives. It's a mixed bag of EVERYTHING a tv series should be. I'm glad I waited to watch so I could binge as many as I wanted, I can't imagine watching only one every week!"
1.0,15 February 2022,"Breaking Bad is so good that I don't think I have the words to convey the level of excellence of praise it deserves. From the first episode I was hooked and entertained like never before. The attention to detail, the pace, the character development, the filmography, the writing and acting by all characters are flawless. Every episode makes you want to start up the next one to find out what happens. I've watched them all 3 times now and I still notice new things."
10.0,7 July 2023,"This show is perfect.

Bryan Cranston is perfect as Walter White: his character is on the verge between bad and good and is absolutely terrifying.

The cinematography is amazing, the script writing, the direction, the use of symbolism, the choice of music is perfect.

The storyline is fantastic, no plotlines are left unsolved and all the characters are important to the story in some way.

I can't think of anything bad about this show. It's just perfect.

This show is filled with secret details and hidden meanings, so every time you watch it you notice different details and the show doesn't go on for too long or too short.

Well done Vince!"

the title of my series is Breaking Bad . The genre of this series is drama , investigation or even thriller.Breaking bad come from USA,The language is inglish.there are five seasons and sixty two épisodes.It's the story of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a high school, he has incurable lung cancer.To raise a lot of money to shelter his family, he decides to manufacture and sell crystal meth, He offers Jesse, a former student read to team up.

My note for this series is ten out of ten."
10.0,19 July 2012,"This show is awesome!! I was blown away immediately. Who would have thought that Bryan Cranston had that kind of force? The characters on Breaking Bad are rich with life. Every character on the show has a humanity about them that just drags you into the unfolding drama. The only character I don't like is Skylar. With all the drug dealers, thieves, and macho tough guys it's hard to believe that she would come across as the most ungrateful, callous, and cold hearted person on the show. Her character should be killed off the show. Bryan Cranston is outstanding and the supporting cast are superb. AMC has stepped up the game for all shows. I can't stop watching. This show rocks!!"
10.0,1 February 2012,"Just finished watching S2 ,and ,i was amazed with these series. Was expecting story of cancer having teacher taking opportunity to make much money with making drug,got money get well....But after watching 3 episodes i saw i was wrong ,watched whole season 1 in one day, couldn't stop watching

Acting of Cranston (watched previously in Malcolm) is outstanding ,whole show is, but turning from ordinary teacher to drug making genius ,wow. Story is fantastic with so many twist and turns, especially liked relationship between Mr. White and Hank, and Mr.White and Jesse.

Best show i have ever seen....

10.0,1 July 2021,"One day i was going to download GOT (as most of the guys say the greatest show on the planet) and read some reviews and according to most of them last two seasons suck. So i actually lost my interest and then i scroll down the page and wholaah i saw breaking bad and i went on and check some reviews oh boyyy most of them were 10/10 and some of them were 9/10 and most of 9/10 guys theory was that they couldn not watch and enjoy another show after watching this. So i decided to give this a go and i downloadwd first two seasons and watched the first episode which was indeed funny and interesting and then moving on to next episodes and they were ok but still could not understand what te hell was that rreviewers talking about cuz it seems like an average show, no suspense at the end of an episode no curiosity what so ever. But i decided to give a go for the second season too and so glad that i did, from about halfway of the second season the climax began and oh boy even with the exams at work i could not stopped watching the show and one day i deleted the complete season 3 which i downloaded cause i knew that i am gonna screw my exams if i kept that im my phone. After the exams i immediately downloaded all seasons 3 4 5 and started to watch from the bebeginning and within a few weeks just finfinished the show and after finishing the final episode it felt like a part of me was gone and my life wont be the same. After all these years still couldn't find a show that gives the pure joy of breaking bad. If you have some other shows in your mind,before watching this you better finish them cause if you watch this first you wont enjoy any other show for a long time. Breaking bad will be and always be the greatest show on the planet earth."

I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this series. I know some people that refuse to watch because it has to do with heroin, but the message is so much larger then that. I feel it's a show, showing just how bad this drug is and how it will ruin your life. Man has cancer, can't pay for treatment so he results to drug dealing and his life spirals out of control. AMC delivers another knockout hit."
10.0,21 August 2021,"Here i am to bow down, to the greatest tv series of all time.

1.0,24 June 2019,"From the construction of a drug dealer and former chemistry teacher, to the deconstruction of an drug addicted who never cared for anything but himself into a guy who's tired of being lonely and apart from making some terrible choices, actually have a good heart. This series just overcome all possible expectations and delivers a story that makes you feel sorry for the bad guy without realizing how bad he is. The chemistry teacher with cancer who wanted nothing but to leave some money for his family becomes the best cooker and biggest dealer in a large perimeter. His partner who showed to be missing some intelligence, by the end becomes as great as him in the cooking, and during the show provides some cleaver moments, which makes you connect with the character. Walter's whole family falling apart, him making more money than were ever possible to imagine, the connection between him and Jessie, like a father and son(even more solid than he has with his own). It all comes to lock you into this series and it doesn't take much expensive scenes with action and explosions, but a perfect drama and some clever moments. That's when you realize that there are no wasted episodes, they all contribute to the story and make it whole, different than other shows that have so much potencial but insists in maximizing the profit by putting 23 episodes, where maybe 13 could tell much better. An exemple of perfect storytelling and drama, they build the tension in each moment without fooling you. They make every scene worth it, and in the end, you just feel bad it's over. Everyone should watch this show."
10.0,25 July 2021,"Breaking Bad is the best series I have watched. And I can say for sure that it will be the best series ever made and ever going to be made. If someone hasn't watched this, it is high time you don't miss such a series. But, CAUTION!!! Please watch it only if you think you have a good amount of discretion power because the series, if gone haywire in your mind, can easily turn you into a different (bad) person. So, whatever is said in the series please take it only in the spirit that the creator intends.

Creator Vince Gilligan has merged very simple real-life situational dilemmas and presented world-class content. The starting of the story is very simple and natural. A middle-aged man is looked upon as a genius(which he really is), but the money that he makes by his teaching job is not proportionate to his genius mind. So, when he encounters a risky path to earn huge money, his brain immediately accepts the path and its repercussions of it too and, and he starts his venture in it. What happens to this man, is the rest of the series.

Yes, we have seen content like this before but the classy thing about Breaking Bad is the crafting of the relationships of the Protagonist Mr. Walter White. His relationship with his business partner Jesse Pinkman, his wife Skyler White, his son Walter Jr and to break the ice, the growing relationship with his brother-in-law Hank Schrader.

Personally, Jesse Pinkman's character is the only one that is well-written throughout the show, until they kind of diluted it (to a small extent, not too much) in the continuation of the series El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. His character is such that you will be able to relate to his actions and emotions and accept them not instantly maybe but after certain thoughts. Whenever he is happy, there is some kind of pleasant feeling in the audience. His building relationship with Mr. White (as he says! Lol) is simply marvelous to watch. Aaron Paul... What an actor!

And finally, Mr. White... Bryan Cranston is the showrunner. We are hooked till the end to know what happens to this innocent yet cruel man.

This unique characterization has rocked the show. Although there might be some questions like 'Is the ending of Walter White the best one for him?' and 'Does the course of events that lead to the ending of Walter White extremely convincing?', the depth of his character will leave a lasting impression in the hearts of the audience. And this will last hopefully forever.

All the supporting characters improved the natural feel of the entire show. Anna Gunn as Skyler White has, I think played the best wife character ever. Hank Schrader... Man! What a characterization. Although he deserved a better ending, he rocked.

Now, for those who might say that there is not much scope for CGI in the show like any other show such as The Boys, please wait for Season 4 where an important character dies, it'll be a jumpscare for you!

Music - Never felt it was there only... The perfect package of music for a perfect show. Added greater depth.

Overall, it is a must-watch show ever in history, so don't miss it."
10.0,2 October 2023,"I remember when the final season aired, it was around the time when multilayed marketing really hit the social networks. 'Breaking Bad' was everywhere, people in the work places that never seen an episode were getting excited for a finale they had not even spent a full hour watching. I don't think this is the greatest show ever written, not even in my top ten. Cranston is out of this world, but he is a prolific actor.

Where as Aaron Paul is left wanting throughout the entire series, he was just not layer or in sync with Cranstons presence. I would say Paul is a pour it on actor, more is more for this guy, but I guess that explains his lack of work since BB ended.

Now to the writing, well let's just say in my opinion it's lazy and drab writing, with few moments of excellence (S5, E7 & generally any scene with Giancarlo Esposito). The character arcs are slow, and don't really develop much outside of the first series. It drags and drags as a series, in fact I cannot remember much from the entire series as it was not worth storing in my memory. Which is weird as still vividly remember scenes and episodes from ER & other shows from the last 3 decades.

Again, Cranston and Esposito are powerhouses. But Pauls one token word that suprisingly isn't said as often as we think, is said in such an annoying manner, that it's almost impossible to forget and enough to put you off a series......"
10.0,19 November 2021,"The greatest TV show of all time!!!

10.0,3 February 2015,"To be honest, when I heard about this show, I wasn't interested at all. I'm not much of a TV guy, so it shouldn't be surprising that I wasn't interested in the first place. After a few years after it started, a friend of mine recommended this show to me and I finally watched it. I was blown away. I have never watched a series more addictive or gripping in my entire life. After each episode, you'll just be wanting more and more. This show has everything such as perfect writing, unforgettable scenes and a top notch soundtrack.

I honestly believe Breaking Bad is better than most movies ever made, and that's saying a lot. I would highly recommend this show to anyone. If you have not seen this show yet, start with the pilot episode and go on from there. You will not be disappointed in the slightest.

Score: 10/10"
10.0,20 October 2013,"John Wayne once said that the hallmark of a good actor is for the audience to watch an actor and not feel that they are actually acting. The screenplay/writing was beyond clever. It was brilliant. And the top notch acting combined by all the actors made this probably the best series I have ever watched over the last 22 years with the exception of the mini series Lonesome Dove which I would call a draw. Better than Alias, better than Dexter...both of which captivated me completely. Let me just put this into perspective. One of the greatest actors of our generation, Anthony Hopkins sat down, just as I did and did a marathon viewing of the show and praised not only Bryan Cranston (as one of the greatest actors he has seen) but the whole cast as one greatest acting ensembles ever gathered. I can't believe this came out of AMC.

They say that there are no new ideas, that everything has already been done once or twice. No, this wasn't the same old tired series, it wasn't a recycled good show. It proves that creativity hasn't died and that repeats and remakes are no longer completely necessary laziness. It showed that fresh creativity still exists. This show sucked me in to the characters, good or bad and made me sympathize with each of them. It made me feel like a hero and a low life criminal, a victim, a cop, it made me look at each side of me and blurred the lines between right and wrong. There was no black or white. Only shades of Grey and a narrative of the main character and others going from white to dark Grey and descending into total hell . Enough to conflict my soul for a long long time. Total excellence. :)"

9.0,29 September 2013,"I certainly couldn't describe to anybody what Breaking Bad has meant to me. This show has made me laugh, made me cry, made me afraid, like no other show ever has. This is absolutely AMC's finest work. Now that it's over, I have got no clue what show I'll go to next.

I've got a ton of options: American Horror Story, Hell on Wheels, Dexter, Under The Dome, True Blood, The Bridge, The Killing, or Sons of Anarchy. I'm currently watching AMC's The Walking Dead, Low Winter Sun, and HBO's Game of Thrones. But I feel like I'm just replacing Breaking Bad, which is almost impossible.

The only reason I even watched this show was because season 3 of The Walking Dead had just ended. I needed another show to hold me off until season 4. I skimmed through Netflix and stumbled upon Breaking Bad, which got really great reviews. As it turns out, I liked Breaking Bad just a bit more than Walking Dead.

I watched season 1 just to see how it was. I loved it, so I watched season 2. I kept watching and watching and watching. I realized I was addicted/hooked when I watched all of season 3 in one day.

When season 5B started, I watched it every Sunday night. And now it's over. I have decided that Breaking Bad is the best show I've ever seen in my life. The final episode of the series was so gripping, so dramatic, almost painful to watch.

I truly recommend Breaking Bad to everybody who enjoys a good TV show."
10.0,1 December 2020,"Usually I love the drama. So this is an epic in my opinion. Such a great direction, can't say much. Never seen this kind of show till date. If you're a drama lover then you must watch this show."
10.0,29 January 2021,"I just finished watching this show today and I was blown away by how outstanding it was. The acting, writing, and story are top notch. Bryan Cranston gives one of the single greatest acting performance in TV & Movie History. His performance is at the Okada-Level and you couldn't have asking for a better acting performance from anyone else if you tried. I highly recommend that you watch this show, because it is certainly worth your time."

10.0,15 February 2022,"I absolutely hated this show. I watched the vast majority of it and found it alternately predictable and completely implausible. I mean, I watched and enjoyed GoT so the plausibility factor didn't bug me TOO much, but like...seriously, y'all? I see reviews where it's called ""brilliant,"" and ""the greatest drama series ever,"" and I feel like I MUST'VE watched a COMPLETELY different show. I'll watch (at least some of) it again, but for now? Boring, predictable, unlikeable characters. 👎🏻"

10.0,16 November 2012,"I know thats a pretty generic title that you probably hear a lot but this is no exaggeration. This show is pure gold from start to finish of every episode. I watch the new episodes every Sunday religously and I cant wait until the rest of the season is aired. They are one season 5 and sadly it is going to be the last season.

This show stars Bryan Cranston. You may remember him as the goofy dad on Malcolm in the middle. Though in this show he is anything but goofy he is cool and calculating. Every performance of his is so good I really never thought he could act so well but every episode Im blown away. The side cast all does a very good job and the writing is just so intense and suspenseful it keeps you guessing every second.

This movie is about a chemistry teacher named Walter White(Cranston) who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. His world is shaken when he finds out knowing that without him his family will certainly suffer monetarily. So he makes the decsision to cook meth in order to provide for his family once hes gone though once entering the drug game things start to go out of control.

This is with out a doubt the best show on television Im so upset this is the last season. This show is great for anyone who likes suspense and a terrific show. Some people are put off by the subject matter of this show but that should not put you off if you don't watch this show you are missing out greatly."
9.0,25 January 2021,"Since there is a pandemic upon us , I decided to watch Breaking Bad . A simple show about a chemistry teacher who decided to become a Drug Dealer to support his family . But... It is much better than that. What makes the show good is Walter's character development as he slowly enters the darkness . And also , it's unpredictable storyline makes the show one of the best series ever. Although , I must admit that the first season is kind of boring . But it all pays off to the final season which I can guaranty the best season finale EVER . That's just my opinion . Overall , this is the best show ever which I think can compete Game Of Thrones ."

9.0,20 January 2024,"I just don't get it ! Second time having a go at this and this time gave it six episodes before giving up. I love this type of show normally and it's so highly rated and recommended, but I find it dull, depressing, mostly boring and just bla. Even in the absence if running out of other good shows, I just don't see why point in struggling through more of it. Would not recommend! On the positive side, the acting is good...Highlights the downsides of the American healthcare system pretty well..other than that, I'd be grasping at straws to try to find much about this show that I could rave about tbh."

10.0,25 January 2021,"This show has Literally change my life, one of the best shows I've ever seen, and I've watched it eight times now. The more you watch it the better it gets, and reveals more clues, so you would enjoy it even more. Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul are outstanding!!! It makes you laugh, smile, cry, angry, frustrated and love. You will cry at the end because there is no more episodes!!! FANTASTIC"
8.0,30 September 2013,"This is my first review.

I have been waiting for something as big as Breaking Bad to write it.

This show is the best I have seen. The way Vince Gilligan plays with us, making us create theories about how next episode will be, shows that it really gets you hooked. Almost every episode leaves you wanting more.

I really like how this series use psychology and chemistry in a very amusing way, making you sometimes feel awkward or bad for the characters, that, by the way, are perfectly worked.

Today this series ended with Felina, that is the most satisfying ending the show could had."
10.0,20 May 2021,"I've seen so many headlines, so many articles, surveys, whatever, all say that Breaking Bad is the best TV series in history, and well I got to say, it is truly a masterpiece, I fell in love with absolutely every character, so magnificently written, amazing pacing and one of the greatest plots on a tv series I've seen, and don't get me started on the cinematography, every scene, every frame it's an absolute masterpiece.

Now when it comes to the Fly episode, I must say I've read so much saying it's the worst episode of the series, and it probably was one of the episodes I was most excited to watch (along with Ozymandias and Crawl Space), I enjoyed the fly episode, such shots and expression due to this fly, I analyzed it, wondering if the fly was even real, people who hate this episode can't tell what's going on unless it's shown explicitly on screen. Overall 10/10 The only readily I would put it a 9 it's because it's over. Amazing show, can't get enough of it."

10.0,31 December 2022,"This could easily have been done in two episodes with a little stretch maybe three. However, I get it that the creator and writers found a gullible audience and rightfully chose to milk it. Hurray to capitalism! Too many instances all throughout the show the situations are so ridiculously unrealistic as if the writers are saying: ""In your face! You gullible audience (which equals lacking intelligence), eat this yet another bogusly impossible situations and outcomes because we got you captivated. We will twist and turn for another three seasons even though we are certain you can already predict the ending. But we'll come at you with excruciatingly brain numbing drama coupled with hyper extended slow character development. Just when we're finished painting the picture of a dimwit, we will make them carry out some out right spectacularly unbelievable MacGyver like witty narrow escape or some plainly uncharacterized heist.""

Yeah! I allowed myself to be gullible, endured the insult on my intelligence because of some of the very little sound bites of science (Chemistry) and was hoping for a plot twist. Oh! Yes, the writers almost got the twist right a couple of times but quickly missed the opportunity by killing off the right characters for the plot twist. What a shame, had they gotten it right I would have been ready for a lot more seasons. BEWARE!!! If you are easily offended by shows that appear to insult your intelligence, this one is not subtle in that regard, find something else.

The wrong, most boring and repetitive characters were kept to the end. What a waste of time."
10.0,5 October 2013,"Truly a fantastic show with an epic build up. It's definitively one of the best shows to exist. Everything about this show is great. The build up of each character is fantastic. Vince Gilligan truly made a work of art. It's a show that everyone should experience. It has everything you could possibly want from a show. It has it's funny moments, it has drama and the epic violent moments that keep you watching. Every detail in the show is important and all the cliffhangers are totally worth it. The acting is fantastic and the plot is great. You really get to know and feel for the characters. Everyone did a fantastic job on this show and I'm definitely glad that I got to experience such a brilliant show."

10.0,18 January 2021,Best series ever made! A show that continually gets better from start to finish. It's a must watch for all viewers. To put this show into perspective I've watched it from start to finish 6 times it's that good. The best part about watching it again are the little hints you see before hand as to what you'll expect. The cinematography and soundtrack are also amazing the way it adds to the show. 11/10 rating for me!
10.0,29 September 2013,"Breaking Bad can tear you apart with a gunshot, and also with a phone call. It can air an episode full of one jaw-dropping action scene after another... and then it can turn around and make you gasp through the sheer quietness of a remote cabin. This series has been a character study in one individual, famously going from Mr. Chips to Scarface, but having seen Walt at both those extremes. You Have to see this series before you die. if you wonder humph what after Breaking Bad well i suggest Oz,The Wire,Got,and Suits. but non of those series can get a ""Heisenberg"" level I apology my bad speech but hey i dnt give a sht Have A1 day."
10.0,26 January 2021,"I have watched this series 6 times over since 2013. The best story, cinematography, music and directing of any series you will ever watch. It drags you in and won't let go. SO GOOD"
10.0,15 October 2014,"""Nothing stops this train!"".. you realize early on how accurate those words are, and the intensity only ramps-up as the episodes go by... unavoidably and ultimately heading towards a very dark place (and you start to make an educated guess how it is all going to end). It's a highly acclaimed, award winning show... with production values that are very high, and acting across the board that is outstanding. Bryan Cranston and Anna Gunn are pure gold.. his transformation to an uncontrollable monster, and her attempts at having to deal with all goes with it, is unquestionably remarkable work. There's really only a couple main characters in the entire show that are at all likable, the rest are drug-dealing criminals and low-life's, or damaged personalities. It was most disappointing to see the alluring Krysten Ritter.. bit.ly/15r7d1Z .. depart after so few episodes.. most fans would have truly liked to see her continue for another season or two. It was a loss for the show, having such a dynamic female character excised so quickly. Once she left, the only reason to stick with the series is to see how all plays out between Skyler and Walt. What is most at issue is the writing. The story just has numerous obvious and unbelievable elements that cannot be overlooked, although it appears most viewers are unabashedly willing to do so. It's not enough of a reason not to watch (although the recurring violence could really be a deal breaker for many). A solid 5-stars, not to say, it could have been better with just some minor script alterations."
2.0,22 January 2021,"This is my first review, but I felt I needed to after finishing watching Breaking Bad. I have been wanting to watch this for a long time but ended up watching other shows and maybe didn't want to watch it as I was worried it wouldn't live up to the hype and other user reviews. How wrong was I. After what I though were a slow 3 first seasons and at times I struggled with episodes and the slowness of the whole program, the 4th and 5th seasons blew me away and once I had finished the series I realised why and how everything in this show had done what it had done. The cinematography is phenomenal, the way scenes are shot really does work with the show and improves what is already a great show. The acting is amazing from all the characters, the one of many things that impressed me with this how is the way your feelings for different cast members change over the seasons and you end up rooting for people that you never thought you would. There are some OMG moments and that happens when least expected and that increased my enjoyment of the show. Is this the best show I have ever watched? No, that without doubt has to be the Sopranos but this is a very close 2nd. Now to watch El Camino and Better Call Saul and see if they are half as good!"

After finishing an episode you just cannot wait 'til the next episode. And every episode is fun from the beginning until the end, there are no boring moments. Following the life of a chemistry teacher that turns into a bad-ass meth cook just doesn't get boring. I give this series a 10/10 because it's just flawless. I would recommend everyone to watch it, but keep in mind that there are some disturbing moments, viewer discretion is advised. Amazing series."

This show is pure genius and the writing is magnificent i think it is safe to say that Breaking Bad is the greatest TV show of all time PERIOD. I have seen legendary shows like The Wire and The Sopranos but none can be compared to Breaking Bad, the acting is top notch. So for the people that have not seen the show and for the future generation that are going to go to IMDb to read the reviews before seeing it i have only one thing to say: Do you want a Epic series this is it. Pure quality from season 1-5."
10.0,25 June 2013,"I never thought that there will be a show (or a movie) deserving only superlatives when spoken (or written) of.

Words simply can't describe this series.

The writing, the acting, every little bit and piece - simply WOW!

Watch it, and get blasted away by this genius piece of art.

The only problem with BB is that after watching it all other series simply are no fun to watch.

I do think, that this is the highest point where a TV series could get, and doubt that it'll be changed any time soon.

I'll leave it at that, no need for spoiling."

In general terms, the history was very understandable, i believe everything, the actors and the actresses acting very well. when i refer to the places and the crew they are very organized.

at last, i like everything about braking bad so i invited you to enjoy this series i swear it wont let you disappointed.

10.0,22 November 2020,"This series comes across as any other drug show that is available anywhere, but a closer look and a continued watch past as early as season 1 will show that it is heartfelt, intelligent, gritty, addicting, and masterful. The characters are cast perfectly and I can't recall one who isn't absolutely amazing. I've never felt so conflicted with how I wanted the show to go on and to end. Even as Walter grows worse and worse, you still are bound to him, and for some reason believe maybe he has some sort of redemption left in him. I've never been so engrossed in a show before. It was an absolutely unforgettable experience and it deserves every bit of love it gets."
1.0,18 September 2012,"When I started watching this show I had never thought such a concept would attract me that much but as I watched I thought to myself how could I have missed such a show. It is the best in comparison to any show I've watched. Be it Game Of Thrones or The Wire, this is better. The direction of Vince Gilligan is extraordinary. I love the way he has characterized the people in this show.

Bryan Cranston is a clean winner. However his character may be, he is the best that there is. There is absolutely no comparison in terms of greatness with such a character or actor in the cast. Aaron Paul has done an amazing job as well. He has played the role Jesse as it should have been. You name any character and he/she has done a great job. Giancarlo Esposito is one of the best and baddest villain created. Everyone must definitely watch this show. Every season gets better."
10.0,18 November 2021,"Brba is worst TV series seen my life... ( The wire , The Sopranos , Narcos series was excellent one but Brba was very Overrated series is good one but not worth is word GOAT.)

Brba was good one and another Jessie character good one and Very simple story line , and Predictable screen play Twist not impressive so one time watchable not a worth of 9+ rating."
10.0,20 February 2021,Brilliantly scripted series. Hats off to the writers and creators. Mind blowing portrayal of lead characters by actors. Very much close to the society and the changes that money makes in man is shown. The needs of man are never ending. Must watch series for everyone...
10.0,16 January 2015,
10.0,12 June 2015,"What a sublime and religious experience it was to watch this series. Bryan Cranston has become a great favorite of mine. The series portrays him as a chemistry teacher Walter White, who is making ends meet by also working as a cashier in a garage after school hours.

One day he collapses. He finds out that he has lung cancer and not long to live. He decides to set aside a large sum of money for his family before he dies - partly to satisfy his ego and partly for the love of his family. He gets his inspiration from Hank Schrader his wife's brother-in -law who is a DEA agent. Hank invites Walter to a drug bust where he spies a dropout student of his Jesse Pinkman(Aaron Paul) discretely sneak away. Walter follows Jesse and tells him of a plan to start-up a meth lab and make a lot of money for themselves. They make a vow of complete secrecy.

The series then deals with unforeseeable events that arise when it comes to selling the meth discretely without drawing the attention of the DEA. Walter wants to sell the meth in large quantity, but Jesse tells him not to rush it and keep selling it in small amounts while still making a good sum of money. Walter keeps on pushing Jesse and we see the first tragic consequence of that action. From then onwards, it is a roller coaster ride full of highs and lows till the inevitable end of the trip.

The series is filled with colorful characters that you will remember for a lifetime, and an ending that will take your breath away...

More TV shows to see: Tales From The Crypt 1989, Masters Of Horror 2005, Fear Itself 2008, Tales From The Darkside 1983, The Twilight Zone 1985, The Outer Limits 1995."

It is a violent show, but that's was fast forward is for. The full story was told...or so we thought. The movie tied it all up nice and neat. Would love to see something of this caliber again."
10.0,3 July 2022,"Rating: 8.3

Favorite Episode: Ozymandias

A super realistic, naturally dramatic depiction of how drug dealing ensnares everyone around you. Every episode is either good or great with a few standouts (Ozymandias, Felina, Full Measure). The only reason it's not a 9 or 10 is because of some purely Hollywood moments that made little sense, a few decent plot points that made no sense, and mundane dialog that greatly extended the runtime (unnecessarily). The best example of this is Episode Fly, nearly all the episodes could have shaved 15 minutes off the runtime without losing any detail.

10.0,13 November 2013,"Bryan Cranston...who would have known this marvelous talented actor can be such a menacing, dangerous, bad-ass that cooks meth and trying to become the most greatest kingpin of all time. He simply nails the role of Walter White from being a scared man who then transforms into the all mighty Heisenberg. Then we have our other characters from our wanna be gangster Jesse Pinkman, an annoying wife beautifully played by Anna Gunn, our D.E.A agent Dean Norris, and our purple loving freak Betsy Brandt. All theses people play their part wonderfully making the show exciting and not boring at all. As each season goes we get to met our baddies such as: Crazy 8, Tuco, The Mexican Twins, Gus, and Neo-Nazi brothers, including Heisenberg himself. This show will keep you on the edge wanting to know what happen next from the start. What makes this show perfectly is that everything ties in leaving no clues behind. What makes it even better is that Bryan Cranston leaves us a remarkable character who we can relate too and love till the end."

9.0,13 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is great. The last two seasons were just amazing. But I think it doesn't deserve 10 stars (9 are okay) because of the first two/three seasons. They were cool, don't get me wrong. But I really had to fight myself to watch them because it bored me how everything was kind of the same all the time. But the last three episodes boosted the Show so much. I couldn't have thought of a better ending."

10.0,18 January 2021,"A friend told me I had to start watching in 2011. I watched first two episodes and quit, thinking...not really my cup of tea. I didn't understand what all the rage was about. Then in 2014 I decided to give it a real shot. The upside, I got to watch all the way through. By S1 E5 I was hooked, binged in 5 straight days. The character development is sensational. I cannot think of another show that let me feel the characters, truly feel them, as Breaking Bad did, and I've pretty much watched them all. People probably don't remember Brian Cranston as the Dad in ""Malcolm In The Middle"" and probably not much of anything he did before or after Breaking Bad, and it's not because he's not a fine actor. Once you climb the highest mountain, not much else seems that interesting. Do yourself a favor and watch now. I've done it thrice!"

10.0,25 September 2013,"Completely by coincidence I began watching Breaking Bad, one of my friends posted a random facebook status, where he mentioned how he thought Breaking Bad was ""king and season 5 was awesome""

I knew that the show existed because I continuously saw Bryan Cranston's very intense face on Netflix, but I never took further notice of it, and just went on seeing some other show. But after I saw that post on my timeline, I just gave the show a chance and decided to see the Pilot, which was the least I could do. And man, was that a turning point, I mean outstandingly amazing Pilot, that just captures and overwhelms you.

A couple of minutes ago I finished all seasons and 1st half of season 5 which will be the last season. I am literally anxious to see the second 2nd half. Breaking Bad is the most intense, exciting, breathtaking, well-acted/directed TV-show I've ever seen, like really ever. In the beginning, after I read the plot, I was a little unsure on how they were going to make this show anything but average. But they most certainly could.

I never heard of Bryan Cranston before Breaking Bad, I later found out that I saw him briefly in 'Argo' but that was it. So I didn't know what I could expect acting wise, I guess I wasn't that quick to appreciate his significant performance throughout the first season, because well, I don't know. But somewhere a long the road of season two, I just became more or less speechless of his stunning talent and so terribly convincing acting. The way Walter White changes through the series made me reflect back on season one where I found him so innocent, and thinking this thing with cooking will pass sometime soon, but of course it didn't Bryan Cranston breaths new life into everything he touch as being Walter White, and this character just gives me a roller- coaster ride. I went from thinking he was innocent and trying to help out his family, to completely have nothing left for him and I have like zero sympathy for him anymore. He is manipulating everything around him, I mean everything, but my mind is really torn on how I want this show to end, I don't really have an opinion, like I believe Vince Gilligan has the best ending in his sleeve ready for us.

Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, was just amazing. I think Aaron Paul is really, really talented and the chemistry between him and Cranston is unquestionably the best I have seen for a while. I loved the character of Jesse from second one, he gives the show the humorous side of it, and his waterfall of talking and phrases is just brilliant. He begins the show like a bit of a around-on- the-floor-type-of-guy, but I mean that he changes into something that he can be proud of, I mean the man got his challenges, who doesn't? But he is the human of the show, or at least he develops into. He is the character who cries the most, I mean red-eyed, tear dropping crying, and who is like affected about all the craziness that is going on: The numerous victims and sacrifices and the feeling of almost getting caught, and always have to get something out of the way, or constantly fighting for your life. His focus goes from being wealthy to not really care about being rich at all, like he has realized what stuff that – indeed - means something. I am really glad, that he didn't get cut off the show. I mean where would it have been without Jesse Pinkman and Aaron Pauls tremendous portrayal of him.

This is so well-written, and so credible story that just keeps getting stronger season for season. Which I believe is very unique, how many times have I not been sitting back watching a really good series fall apart because it keeps going on for no reason? This does not fall apart. It only gets better, stronger, more intense and more exciting through all seasons. This story could be, it actually could be realistic in some aspects, and this just shows how a life really can hit a turning point that changes you and your surroundings forever, and that is realistic.

The cast, the entire cast is incredible, and the writers, directors, everyone involved in this project have created a legend in form of Walter White, and not to mention that they have created one of the best show the world has seen (according to me of course) I have to mention Aaron Paul again, because he is also a very big reason for this show success. He is just unbelievable good.

I'm excitingly waiting for the last 8 episodes. I'm sad that I have to say goodbye to Jesse and Walter but I guess its for the best. Vince Gilligan has made a masterpiece, that I guarantee will be remembered, and every single award this show has received, every piece of critical acclaim it has received, has been very much deserved.

Yo, now there's nothing left but to wait"

1.0,18 October 2013,"Let's talk for a moment about how this TV show looks - it's stunning. The blues of the New Mexico sky, the browns and tans of the desert, the lights at nighttime, and the blue of the pure meth. In an era of great TV, Breaking Bad'd stunning visuals put it ahead of the pack. Just look at the framing of the shots, the odd camera angles. There's so much to see here visually that you really shouldn't watch it on a small device, but always on a big screen TV. We know all about how great the acting and writing is, but the look is in a league of its own. Oh, and then there's Skinny Pete. And Badger. And Saul. And the Twins. And Hank. And Tuco. And so on."
10.0,25 November 2021,"I'm totally waste of my time.

The only positive was water white character and Jessie character that's.

But is very very Overrated series seen my life.

Story plat normal , screen play and Twisted predictable once and 5 season very slow and not engaged and some lagging episodes very irritating me.

Please don't watch don't waste your time."
10.0,22 September 2013,"Breaking Bad is a work of art. It is always going somewhere. It seems that from the beginning they planned it to be five seasons long because everything falls into place and everything is pointing towards an inevitable ending.

Every character in the show is fantastic. The worst ones (as in antagonistic) are filled with redeeming qualities, and also the protagonists are filled with flaws. They all change throughout the series and this is also something that makes it worth watching. This makes your allegiance towards them change, and having such a strong arch makes even some of the secondary characters as complex as some of the best you've seen on film.

It has a tendency to always go in the direction you never expected, but this always works better for the story and it fits into place with more grace than you've ever imagined.

It took me a while to start watching it because going through a TV series is like starting a relationship. You're going to be seeing this for a good amount of time and it is worth thinking before jumping into it, but believe me this is it. It's the pinnacle of the golden age of television. Enjoy every second. I just wish I could watch it for the first time again and know nothing of what's going to happen."
9.0,19 January 2021,"This show is seriously life changing. If you haven't watched Breaking Bad yet, drop everything and start watching it ASAP!!!"
10.0,12 January 2021,This show is an absolute masterpiece. All other TV shows can be rated from 0-Breaking Bad.
10.0,1 December 2020,This show is so good i did a whole presentation for class on this show
10.0,17 May 2015,"Never in my life have I come across a series as perfect as this one. I have watched numerous series, and this is the one that has taken the first position of them all. Man, how did they ever create a series so enthralling, that I didn't even feel the time fly. I has to sit and watch the entire series in less than two months, and now I regret on the haste. Because it was bloody brilliant.

Hank, Jesse, Anna, Flynn, Gus, Mike.....all characters of perfection. And Walter White? He was the man. He became an employee of the devil. Then he became the devil, and ends as a mere man. I multiple levels, this is a perfect philosophical drama as well. Perfection is every frame, and every bit of the story is simply perfect.

This is perfectly bad! The greatest series for one to watch!"
10.0,19 January 2021,The show is good the ckmponents of the story are good the charachters are good amd the acting is the best
10.0,25 September 2013,"Breaking bad is a series that contain violence, drama as well as action, witch make it the best series ever. I can't begin to describe why i like breaking bad. It is just when you have seen a couple of episodes you are hooked! In my opinion the acting is magnificent and the music Vince has picked is really really good to. Breaking bad can be a little weird and slow sometimes but you don't mind because it's awesome anyway. I know this review probably sucks I just wanted to share my love for the series. I have to say that everyone should watch this the minute they get the chance. That's all i have to say about breaking bad for now, just watch it because it is worth it I promise!"

10.0,8 February 2023,"This series is too slow paced and feels boring sometimes. I like the story but lot of unnecessary episodes. First 2 seasons can shortened into one season. Skyler walt feels like unnecessary charecter she with no charecter development. On fifth season director killed all the cast which gives ending which not what we expected.

Jesse pinkman is the charecter which i liked more than Walter. Tuco has only 3 episodes he gives more thrill than Walters first two episodes.

My score on different aspects Story - 8/10 Pacing - 4/10 World building - 6/10 Sound design - 5/10 Direction - 7/10 Cinematography - 8/10 Charecters - 7/10."
10.0,26 September 2013,"I've been watching Breaking Bad ever since AMCTV announced the beginning season in 2008. I was intrigued by the plot line. Once I viewed Episode 1 of Season 1, I was hooked.

First, I can't praise Breaking Bad enough. Everything about the series is absolutely tops. The script (hats off to Vince Gilligan) delivers a consistently high quality, and suspenseful, drama episode after episode and season after season that keeps us viewers on the edge of our seats. The acting is phenomenal. Almost all the actors were unknowns to me. And yet every one of them came across as totally believable as human beings in every scene where they occurred. Every one of them delivered a spot-on performance and I mean even the minor characters like Jesse's buddies, Skinny Pete and Badger. No weak acting in any scene. And the direction and cinematography were outstanding. Anyone who understands films knows all these elements―script, actors, director, cinematography―all play a vital role in making a great movie. And they're all there in Breaking Bad, and I might add, all consistently there season after season. Especially the script and the acting.

As an aside, Hollywood badly needs to take a lesson from Breaking Bad. More and more of the movies coming out of Hollywood rely heavily on an exorbitantly paid movie actor to pull the crowd, CGI, blasting loud music, and shoot-'em-up / blow-'em-up scenes. Watching the trailers of such movies, I find myself wondering how many automobiles suffered a horrific death to make the movie.

From the beginning in Season 1 we've watched the principal character, Walter (aka Walt) White, start out as a dedicated family man and high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One day while working at his car-wash job, he passes out. At the doctor's he discovers he has intractable cancer. He's a decent man, mild-mannered, and dumped on by many people, including the Romanian-American owner of the car wash where he works part-time to supplement his meager teacher salary.

Walt's a guy who so loves his family that he really wants to leave them enough money to survive after he's gone because he doesn't make enough money teaching chemistry and working at the car wash to afford better life insurance. One day his brother-in-law, Hank Schrader, a DEA agent in Albuquerque, takes him along on a meth bust. A fatal turn in Walt's life. He notices immediately that most meth cookers aren't chemists and he knows he could do a far superior job if he set his mind to it. The beginning slide down the slippery slope.

While along on the bust, he sees a young man clamber out of a second story window of the adjacent house, drop to the ground, and scamper away unnoticed by the DEA agents. But not unnoticed by Walt, who recognizes him as a former student in his chemistry class and who wasn't exactly what one would call a stellar student. Enter Jesse Pinkman. And another fatal turn in Walt's life. It was Pinkman's lab that was busted by the Feds, and Walt seeks out Jesse and propositions him. Walt'll cook the meth and Jesse will run the distribution operation. Walt figures he can make enough money this way to provide for his family when he's gone. Soon he's producing an extremely high grade of crystalline methamphetamine quickly known in the trade as ""blue sky."" By the end of Season 1 he's been forced to murder a young man and feels very distraught about it. But of course this is another fatal turn in Walt's life and a further slide down the slippery slope. Soon bodies are falling all around him right and left. Some murdered by him personally and some murdered at his behest.

It's made clear in Episode 1 (summer 2013) of Breaking Bad that Walter White is still alive at season's end. He's a disheveled, worn-out, desperate man on the run. He's returned to his fenced-in, abandoned house in Albuquerque. He says hello to his former neighbor, Carole, who is so startled by him and by his appearance that she drops her load of laundry and holds her hand up to her mouth in utter shock.

Walter White doesn't die a physical death, at least not by the season's finale. Along the way from being the good high school teacher who wanted to provide for his family to becoming Heisenberg, the greatest meth kingpin ever, he's warped his soul more and more into an unrecognizable human being to the people who love him. In this season's Episode 2 standing directly in from of Walt but staring blankly into space Hank mumbles, ""I don't even know who I'm talking to."" Walter White has died spiritually. He is no longer the Walter White Hank affectionately called the brainiac. But who is he?

He's a man who's traversed one end of the spectrum of good and evil to the other end. In this season's Episode 3 we hear Jesse Pinkman's voice-over warning us: ""Mr. White, he's the devil."" But no human being, no matter how evil they've become, is completely evil. They still preserve a residue of their humanity. A tiny glowing ember of what's left of their soul. They can still feel emotional pain. They can still love their family and long for them. They can still show compassion. And that in the end is what makes human beings so unique. We can never venture totally beyond good and evil. The Old Testament expresses it well: Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil. Genesis Chapter 3:22. But it's not enough to know good and evil. We are bound morally to use this knowledge to prevent our desires from driving us to utter destruction. For our own sake, for the sake of our loved ones, and for the sake of humanity. As brilliant as Walter White was, he failed to grasp this crucial moral imperative."
10.0,29 September 2013,"So, I am writing a no spoiler review for the show, AFTER THE FINALE AIRED. There are a few shows I could consider perfect, well, currently only two....the Sopranos and Breaking Bad. OK in no way am I trying to compare the two, except they both exceed my expectations. Before watching Breaking Bad, there is two things you should know, 1) The description ""A chemistry teacher who makes meth."" is not what the show is about, that is just the first episode character development plays a huge role, 2)the entire series takes place in about a two year period of time (ruling out some rare flashbacks), basically seasons 1-someof 5 are in one year and sometime in 5-finale have bigger time gaps.

Breaking Bad is a marvelous show, it has dark humor and very dark events, so there are some shocking scenes. It just kept getting better and better is a great summary for the show, because when events happen in Breaking Bad, it is shocking, the violence isn't overused and the writing is phenomenal, the thing about this show is that no one is really off limits, anything can happen to anyone at anytime.

Another thing that makes this show great is that tension builds, and when things fall apart you can only watch in horror and shock. The story follows Walter H. White, a father, a husband, a person who doesn't take charity. He earns his money, he has to earn it, for his family......speaking of family, Walt has a brother-in-law in the DEA, I understand that the double life thing seems a little overplayed, but it really works great here.

The cast is perfect, Hank, Walt's brother-in-law really reminded me of someone I know in real life, he is funny, sometimes racist, but he has a place in his heart for family. Then there is Skylar, she is Walt's wife and Anna Gunn does a fantastic job playing her, then there is Jesse, but you'll have to watch the show.

From the hooking beginning to the final episode (which was glorious) Breaking Bad just keeps getting better and better, though I am sad it ended, it was a great run."
10.0,16 January 2021,"Watched through its entirety first back in 2014

10/10

I was late to the party back in 2014 but i'm so glad this show exists. I hadn't really watched a TV show properly before that since 2008/9 so i binged the entire show in 2 weeks. The characters, the dialogue, the emotional ride everything about this show was class

I loved how each season differed and introduced new problems Walt had to face yet overcame, seeing him turn from this loving jolly family man to some gangster mythological Escobar type figure"
10.0,1 November 2013,"This has been absolutely the best thing I have seen on T.V for years...no...EVER! From the moment I started watching it I just wanted to see more. My husband and I watched this together and would often try to guess what was gonna happen next....99% of the time we were completely wrong. I loved that. I found the characters all very interesting and great to see how they progressed given their situations at the time. It would have been nice to get some closure on some of the characters and what happened to them afterwards (Skyla and Marie mainly) but I think I will survive.

The downside of watching Breaking Bad is that everything else on TV now seems disappointing :("

10.0,25 May 2022,"I only watched one season. And while I have been told numerous times that the show picks up, I just couldn't get into it. Don't get me wrong, I think the character development of Walter White is done exceedingly well, even in this one season. And I think the concept of the show is brilliant. But, I also think it was made in another era already - it was good but it will not stand the test of time."
10.0,29 January 2021,I don't need to describe how good this show is just go watch it
9.0,19 January 2021,"Actually not not that well hidden. I really liked the character development - and was surprised how I interacted with those developments. So many great character - and sadly a believable plot. Great acting by all (I mean it). So where do I go from here? In life I mean, not that I'm cooking 🙄. Lots of opportunity to feel what is important in life, what is just noise. Also, there, but for the grace of god, go I. Except I'm not qualified to teach chemistry, so relax! Very well done."
10.0,19 October 2013,"Can't believe I just checked out the Greatest Show on TV 2 weeks when it was about to end since people all over networking sites were buzzing about it and it got me curious. One lazy Wednesday afternoon, I've nothing else to do I decided to take a look. I was hooked the very first episode like no ever show had hooked me before. Knowing that the internet is a galaxy of spoilers I decided to stay away from it as I finish the whole show in week.

Now that it's all over it left and at the same time leaving a void in me wanting for more. I was very sad that I just enjoyed it just for a few weeks while those others who were into the show a long time had lots of fun talking about it. It made me feel that I missed the party of the decade. Up until now I still can't get over it as I browse the remnants of breaking bad discussions"
10.0,30 September 2013,"I am a person who loves good movies and series and sees them as piece of art. However, I have never encountered a series which comes this close to perfection as Breaking Bad does. I have been watching it since the very beginning and unlike any other series I have watched, Breaking Bad keeps getting better. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are both absolutely terrific and have probably given the best performances of their lives. I could go on for hours and explain why Breaking Bad is simply the best series ever created but most of it has already been said and words can not describe the experience I made with it. This is my very first review on IMDb and I am not sure if I will ever write another one. I am writing this to express my love for this series and to thank everyone involved in creating this piece of art.

10/10 Masterpiece..."
10.0,14 August 2013,"Since the first episode I started to watch, I couldn't stop. Breaking Bad name is given very correctly to the movie... It takes you from basics of life to somewhere you don't or can't imagine that yourself could be there.. decisions of 'being bad' based on what? Answer is here.. It can be you your friend or whoever.. Just check it out.. Reality, comedy, heavy drama everything is together.. It is a dark movie.. I enjoyed watching it.. I strongly recommend.. All players deserves high credits.. Excellent work... I am surprised why it is not that famous world wide or it hasn't reach high viewer ratings like house m.d. or lost.. however even if you haven't watch, I am sure you'll here the movies name a lot in the near future.."
10.0,21 May 2021,"I'm not a fan of TV shows, neither have I watched a lot of them, but I sure do know how to judge them. This show is the best show ever made. GoT isn't, because it's a book adaptation. All the director needed to do himself was get some excellent visual effects, and a fine cast. The show is not bad, but not an original to be compared to this masterpiece. The writing is brilliant, the acting is brilliant, the cast is brilliant, the pace is perfect, and for those who found it boring, there is no way to make this better. You can't even explain or point out how to make it better, so keep your reviews about this point out!

The idea is out of this world. Obviously the person is gonna die of cancer, so he does things to support his family after he dies, and you can tell they are illegal. Breaking bad. Gettit? Nothing better, and nothing more fresh.

Breaking BEST Bad!"
10.0,28 May 2020,"It's probably the best series ever directed, written meticulously and executed perfectly. Well you would like to take up flaw in directors work since it is so wisely directed. A phenomenal work if you really want to watch some real real fantastic stuff. The best part of this series is casting and equal importance given to the each character kind of justice to each and every actor ( I think every one who have watched breaking Bad cannot deny on this) every character has their own unique importance and they might feel proud of being one very essential part of this series. No one is left alone. Breaking Bad a unique name selected breaking a man. Thinking to watch it again."
4.0,26 December 2020,The first three season are very slow and boring. I really don't understand how this show is rated 9.5. Ok the season 4 and 5 are masterpieces but you can't say that the first three season are at the level of the last 2. (Sorry for my english??)
10.0,25 October 2021,"The Overrated series seen my life breaking bad Water white, Jessie character good one Brba. But story and screen play is very predictable one worst mistake and very boring screen play season episode and Technical work very poor one ugly one this series.

Please don't watch it this series very Overrated one maybe this series deserve only 7+ rating."
10.0,28 December 2009,"Cranston became my favourite comedy actor in Malcolm in the Middle, his timing is impeccable and his physicality brought a freshness to his performance. In Breaking Bad he proves that he is not limited in any way to comedy. Supported by a great cast of more than competent actors (with a special mention for Aaron Paul) Cranston is riveting as a terminally ill chemistry teacher who turns to the dark side to provide for his soon-to-be bereaved family.There are elements of comedy in Breaking Bad-very,very black comedy but comedy nonetheless and that too strikes just the right note in the writing and performances. Not one bit of this story would work if any of the writing,direction or acting was wrong. Everything is spot on. The characters are not written or played as stereotypes and the script is tight and drives the story along. The whole enterprise is about as absorbing as drama can be and one cannot wait to see what happens from one episode to the next- and what happens is never predictable. As for the people who throw up their hands in horror and say that a programme like this glorifies drug dealing and drug use, then watch the damn thing!! If ever a programme shows what drugs do to people then BB does. A real cautionary tale.

I am into series 2 now and hope that the standard continues in the third series. A terrific example of what can be done with TV drama when playing it safe is off the agenda."

10.0,25 August 2014,"Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show originally aired on the AMC network for five seasons, from January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013. The main character is Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series. He turns to a life of crime, producing and selling methamphetamine, in order to secure his family's financial future before he dies, teaming with his former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul). The show was set and produced in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Throughout the series, Walter produces and sells meth to earn money in order to secure the financial future of his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn), and children Walter, Jr. (RJ Mitte) and Holly (Elanor Anne Wenrich). The show also features Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (Betsy Brandt), and her husband Hank (Dean Norris), a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent who is determined to solve the case involving the meth empire. Walter teams up with lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), who helps him get into contact with drug kingpin Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). In the fifth season, Walter heavily involves himself with Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons) and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser).

In 2014, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the highest rated show of all time."
10.0,5 March 2021,"This will grip you on in the first episode I'm now obsessed with it. It's genius I love every shot, every millisecond. You think you know where it's going: you don't, you think it's just another show: it's not"
10.0,26 December 2015,"Pure art. Pure suspense. Pure thrill. Pure comedy. Pure story. Pure meth!

You know what movies (particularly drama), show us? Actors playing some story making the audience, think it as a real life experience. But whatever movie/TV series it is, at some point of time, you get disengaged with grip of the reality of drama and think, that actually is a movie. Of course, who am I kidding! it is a movie. But do you want to get an experience where you wouldn't feel like you're watching a movie, but rather to have a kind of immersion in the story and get all the excitement and suspense you'd get in your life, if Breaking Bad's story happened for real? Then, don't turn your back on this.

From beginning to end, you feel like you're watching the one that happened to be in television's most dark and thrilling adventurous storyline you'd ever experience as a real one in life.

For people who say the play is slow and dull - First of all, you people don't get the sense of an art of making a movie. For the watcher, to believe, director should develop a storyline to be real. So I suggest, while you're watching this, and if you get bore, then rethink. Because that part of the scene will be a prerequisite for rest of the plot. Every frame, every scene, pays off!

For people who say the play consists uncanny bloodshed and obnoxious language - Yes, it does. But, do you want to get the reality of situations the actors face according to the plot? If no, then don't watch.

I am not exaggerating here but I'd say this - If I ever get a supernatural power to erase a part of memory from my brain, then I'd delete the memory what is considered to be the experience I got from breaking bad. Just because, I can watch it again. Nevertheless, no matter how many times you watch, you just scratch your head, how brilliant this is.

Finally, for people who haven't seen it yet - I envy you guys. But, only if you want to watch. Breaking bad is a benchmark. I doubt any TV series surpasses this in the future."
10.0,5 July 2014,"To provide for his family (pregnant wife Anna Gunn and teenager son RJ Mitte)'s future after he is diagnosed with lung cancer, a chemistry genius called Wlter (Bryan Cranston) turned high school teacher teams up with an ex-student named Jesse to cook and sell the world's purest crystal methamphetamine proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling Methamphetamine with one of his former students . Though his talent for chemistry appears to be wasted at the high school level , Walter does seems to enjoy bringing science to young minds . He join forces with Jesse (Aaron Paul), a former student of Walter White's at High School , he is now a producer and occasional user of Meth, known in the area as ""Cap'n Cook."" This affinity for teaching and respect themselves can be seen in the relationship between Walter and Jesse . As Walter thrust into a partnership with an irresponsible, burn-out criminal . The Meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law , Hank (Dean Norris) , who is always hot on his tail.

A main plot point of Breaking Bad concerns the main character, Walt, being a bona fide chemistry genius being accompanied by Aaaron Paul as Jesse who is the classic underachiever , he clearly possesses talents, but is lacking dramatically when it comes to common sense and follow-through . Amusing as well entertaining relationship between Walter/Bryan Cranston and Jesse/Aaron Paul, this paves the way for a classic Odd Couple dynamic as the conservative middle-aged teacher . Very good acting by all cast such as Walter , a mature chemistry teacher at Wynne High School in Albuquerque, New Mexico , he is diagnosed with lung cancer and given approximately two years to live , Aaron Paul as Jesse , he grew up in a somewhat privileged home, the oldest child of an upper middle class Albuquerque family, Jesse was ultimately kicked out of his home due to repeated drug use ; Anna Gunn as Skyler , she is no shrinking violet , she is fiercely protective of her children will do whatever she can to keep them shielded from dangerous influences , she is a patient woman, but that patience will become tested as Walter descends deeper in the seedy world of the meth trade and Dean Norris as an agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency in Albuquerque , he is married to Skyler White's sister, Marie, finely performed by Betsy Brendt , he has a somewhat stereotypical personality for an officer of the law, a gruff, mans man who is cynical about criminals and has aspirations to climb the ladder in the DEA, perhaps moving to a larger department or to headquarters in Washington. Other import characters of this series are the followings : Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman . Steven Michael Quezada as Steven Gomez , Jonathan Banks as Mike Ehrmantraut and Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo 'Gus' Fring . Sony and AMC producers of the series were initially reluctant to cast Bryan Cranston because of his previous comedic roles and considered both John Cusack and Matthew Broderick for Walter White. When they both declined, Vince Gilligan got to cast Cranston .The actor who portrays Walter Jr. in the series (RJ Mitte), actually has cerebral palsy like his character on the show. However, his real life affliction is much milder than his role's, and he had to learn to walk with crutches and slow down his speech to play the part. Rating : 7.5/10 . Above average. Essential and indispensable watching."

10.0,14 March 2022,"And the episode of the fly nails it. The fifth season was a complete mess. Can't understand how this is one of the best rated shows ever.

Go watch Lost, Dexter or any other old ones, they deserve to be on top more than this show."
10.0,27 February 2020,I've watched entire series probably 5 times now over the years. It is seriously that good. The greatest of all time.
10.0,12 May 2020,"Simply put, this is the greatest show I have ever seen. If you haven't started it yet and are still unsure, believe the hype. OK, so a show about an underachieving, middle-class family man deciding to sell Meth with a drop out student of his doesn't sound like the formula for the best TV show in history, but you'd be surprised what a little psychotic alter-ego can do to a man who secretly wants to be king (albeit a meth-king).

The performances, writing, directing, camera work etc are all sublime. It all culminates in creating a world of characters with so much depth, so much attention gone into them that so many of them will surely go down as iconic. What separates this show above all else for me is how all 5 seasons really do feel like one long episode. There are no continuity errors, everything is meticulously planned, even the smallest throw away line or action will come back to haunt someone later on.

Some episodes are slow and some episodes feel like you're watching a bomb go off in slow motion, but the payoffs in this show are like nothing else in TV history. I could binge watch my way through this show again tomorrow...you know what, I just might!"
10.0,17 October 2016,"Master Meth Maker Creation

Created and produced by G. Vince Gilligan OBE's going his way - just like the late Spike Milligan. Well, now then lets see where on earth do I begin? Parts of this poetic parable can be gruesomely grim! So let me just say you need to keep an open mind. Don't take those things to heart if they sound so unkind. Think - could you? - should you? or would you dare? It looks as though this character doesn't even care! Cringe's a certainty in this leading series from USA. What do you think you'd of done on such a doomed day? Well, Walt was out to make mounds of money come what may. Keeping the debt collectors and mere money miseries at bay. Stopping poor Skyler from worrying and of course going grey! Everybody loves Breaking Bad because everyone says so. It is easy on the eye when folk can just go with the flow. B.B. is in the Guiness book for being the highest rated show. It is the epitome of writing that's all I think and all I know. Our love for this damned good program seems to grow and grow. I guess you can definitely say that this bloke is Breaking Bad. Why he was willing to throw away all that he as ever had. Walt wants to give a fine financial future for his family. Mr White knows they will turn on his actions angrily. Walter had a job as a chemistry teacher in high school. Also in a car wash called A1 not too particularly cool. That name should get them to the top of anybody's list. Top of the Boss's list was to make Walt miserably pi***d! Now his main aim is Making Meth in the mobile RV. Doing the deed gets done where nobody can see. Only ending in one way I'm sure you'll agree. Would it be a dreadful D - I - V - O - R - C - E? Or more tragically a trip to the Hospitals A&E? So why did this guy turn to a complicated life of corrupt crime? Did he want to live life differently - this time be more sublime? It all starts when a Sir called Walter White finds out he is dying. His treatment costs so much money - now there is no denying. We certainly can't condone - for this gent is only trying. It's unlawful what he's making it really is high flying! ""Blue Ice"" is so pure the meth heads can't help buying! While the whole time this Master Meth maker's bare faced lying! Causing many people heartache they only end up crying. At times his acts are barbaric and seem totally unfair. Is the reason because the treatment has zapped out all his hair? Though his needs are a must so who can really blame him? It's not like us humans don't divulge in the odd sin. Walter seems to take the news of Cancer in his stride. If you ask me it is a big deal and can be tricky to hide. Walt seems to be enjoying this repulsing roller coaster ride. Guilt is way too much but it's really a small price to pay. All his loving family and friends in Albuquerque he'd betray. Especially his brother in law - Hank who is in the D.E.A. Hank gives Walt insight on how to keep the feds at bay. Helps him keep one step ahead thus avoiding any feds raids. Mr W. is involved in one of the biggest illegal drug trades. Shouldn't think it will bring this mad man many accolades. Fortunately Hank hasn't a clue - not one little idea. At times it's like the end of these shenanigans are near. Walt's decided to cover his identity with just one major word. Came up with the name of a chemist called - Heisenberg. Of course he needed a right hand man with know how and nouse. Jesse Pinkman's who it is he ends up losing his way and a house! Some would say he was a degenerate scumbag or simply a louse. Walter liked his guts and also that he could be as timid as a mouse. Named Captain Cook Jesse knew all ins and outs of the game. So to him it's simply second nature though to us it's quite insane! This pair tettered on the edge of fear never a day that's mundane. Do you think Heisenberg really wanted to cause his family so much pain?"
10.0,19 September 2022,"Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan.

The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008, to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for a total of 62 episodes."
10.0,2 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is a TV show that will really leave a large impact on you. From the amazing cast and crew to the incredible shot selection and character writing.

Breaking Bad is a show that continues to improve each season, Walter white and Jesse Pinkman are the most interesting characters ever written in Television. A High School Chem teacher deciding to completly change his life around with a former student. The emotional ride that both these charcaters go through is so well written.

The all round acting and cinematography is mesmerising, vince gilligan and his team create amazing shots each and every scene and find unique ways to capture tone and emotion, The colour grading and use of colour to depict tone is outstanding."
10.0,31 March 2020,I wanna erase my memory and watch it again this is the best TV Show in history
5.0,9 February 2019,Let me tell you something about breaking bad In my opinion it's the best series ever The story is perfect. It has a fantastic finale The characters are developed so good And the more important thing this is a realistic story You can understand the characters Definitely we won't see something like this in years
10.0,25 March 2019,"Brilliant, bold, unpredictable, impactful, unforgettable. Breaking Bad is as close to perfection as a story can be. It stands above other tv dramas in nearly every way. The characters are complex, interesting and real. The changes in their character are subtle yet drastic. The writing is intense and the slow scenes are never boring. Even lines of dialogue that can seem unimportant can give insight to how a character feels. This is a story that no one should ever go without seeing. Study this in screenwriting school, in acting school, in every school. This is a brilliant timeless masterpiece and stands as our generations defining tragedy alongside stories like Hamlet. Nothing more can be said. A true 10/10."
10.0,8 December 2020,"Below average acting, script, direction and editing. Not at all worth of hype. No natural acting. Unnecessarily stretching the story. 2 episode story stretched to 10 episodes. Super slow. Many series below 6 ratings are much much much better then this."
10.0,10 July 2021,"This show really deserve a 10/10 , between the actors director , producers and the plot all are magnificent , really enjoyed it."
10.0,13 November 2020,"There can't be any comment, juste watch, take your popcorn and enjoy this piece of art ! Mindblowing"
10.0,4 April 2020,From beginning to the end. The detail and story telling is just perfect. The S3E10 'Fly ' episode is one of my favourite. Must watch.
10.0,20 June 2023,"If you had asked me before this show came out do you think Bryan Cranston can portray a dramatic and breathtaking role like Walter White I would have definitely said no, but after watching five brilliant seasons of this. I was proved dead wrong. This is an awesome show. Cranston is an incredible actor and so is Aaron Paul. It is one of those types of shows that once you start watching it you don't want to stop. His evolution from a dorky nerdy high school chemistry teacher to an intimidating Scarface like criminal is incredible. Cranston deserved every Emmy he got. Not to mention Jesse Pinkman is a great character with a lot of development. Vince Gillagen is a genius. This is a must watch!"
10.0,28 September 2019,"It's been six years since this show ended and I STILL have a Breaking Bad-sized hole in my life. Truth be told, it's one of the only reasons I keep Netflix.I'm rewatching it now and it occurred to me that this show would NEVER fly today."
10.0,27 December 2023,"Breaking bad is a show where most people who haven't seen it will still believe that it's the greatest show of all time. The acting is impeccable, the directing, writing, and cinematography are all the definition of perfect. The reason I personally have breaking bad at 9.7/10 stars is simply because there are some episodes the drag, episodes that didn't hold my interest, and episodes that are simply just very unlikeable like the episode where Skyler sings happy birthday, but those faulted episodes are very uncommon because this show is very consistent with its quality considering the worst episode in the show is only a 7/10 personally. Bryan Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul as Jessie Pinkman are two of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen and definitely deserve all the praise. Overall Breaking bad is a must watch for anyone who likes high quality media, if you don't like it then your werid."
4.0,13 July 2022,"Breaking bad has to be the best TV series EVER made. This series has it all! And it never get boring. The second place the ""Better call Saul"" take the price. No surprise as it have to do with Breaking bad. Wow!"

10.0,13 September 2023,"It's just so boring and way to dark. I watched the entire show and was so bored, the only reason I watched it because my friend said is should. So much guts and all that, and I was really bored all the time. Also Walter White kinda looks like the guy from myth busters. But I watched better call Saul and that was pretty good, so I don't know why breaking bad's writing was terrible but better call Saul was great. Honestly bluey is more interesting than the show. This show kinda reminds me of AOT, boring, not a good plot and the good guy turning bad just isn't interesting at all. So to conclude it sucks."
10.0,11 September 2021,The characters are so good and the actors are very good at there acting its the best show you can watch and never get bored.
9.0,16 June 2023,"Breaking Bad is one of the best TV dramas of all time. Besides the fantastic premise, writing, directing, acting etc., the show did what few even great shows are usually able to; navigate a perfect story arc over a five season span.

I love shows that keep me guessing but are able to do so without resorting to plot twists that really make no sense. This show was able to maintain suspense across each episode and slow burn the transformation of the main character in a way that was extremely satisfying.

Breaking Bad also culminated in one of the best last seasons and final episodes of show ever made."
10.0,2 September 2020,This series teached me many lessons of life. With all the characters we connect really welly. And also teaches us that you have to pay for your sins

10.0,1 December 2018,Best show ever. Science crime family Disease everything under a show.. Hatsoff creators
10.0,3 September 2021,"I have seen this show like 3 times, and everytime I am amazed by the greatness of it. This show is so great and has so many elements that are full of greatness. And top reason behind all greatness is the main character of Walter white portrayed by Brian Cranston. I believe a chosen person by God can only justify this portrayal. Let me explain why Brian Cranston was destined to play this role.

This character Walter white has been portrayed as one whose only aim is to provide secure life for his family.. something only kind hearted person would think... He goes to any extend to fullfil his desire. His desire is not evil but full of love and compassion..(again great person) .. Walter white is a giver. Even in his last moments, he sacrificed himself while saving jesse pinkmen, tried to save his brother in law, wife. Of couse he killed enemies but a great hero would save others regardless of his personal equations. He followed path of righteousness most of the time under hard situations. Only a great soul would do that .. In the end, he has taken revenge on bad guys ..a kind of natural justice was served by the hands of great soul.

All that greed for money, walter knew somewhere in his mind that he is never going to enjoy the fortune, and ended up as a loser. Again natural justice was served to Walt.

All those big or minute greatness and blunders reminds me of lord Ram from Ramayana. Lord Ram also followed of path of righteousness. He never got luxury of any kind but served justice and a true giver to humanity. Lord Ram also made mistakes for which his wife Sita sacrificed a lot at the end. Ram could not forgive himself for things he did to Sita but we know he sacrificed for larger cause.

I have enjoyed Breaking bad as much as I enjoyed Ramayana and G. O. T, as I could see parallels in main characters like Ram, Walter White and Jon Snow. Of all these main characters, there is few common things i.e righteousness, justice n sacrifices.

Brian Cranston was destined to play role of Walter, a character that has shades of Lord Ram, and he was in fact chosen by God to give voice dubbing in animated movie called Ramayana in 1993, and that too for Ram's character.. And this cannot be a coincidence."
10.0,23 August 2022,If you haven't watched this your missing out. After episode 4 your hooked! If you like the Sapranos or the Golden Girls this show is for you. If you 15 or 115 years olds it's for you. Pop some corn.
10.0,25 September 2020,This is the best tv show ever created I am addicted to this show
10.0,13 May 2020,One of the best seeres ever and walter wiht is the best character in any series
10.0,16 January 2022,"Breaking Bad is a meticulously crafted and perfected piece of art

This series follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and decides to partner up with a former student named Jesse Pinkman to cook meth in order make enough money for his family before he dies.

In the first episode of the series Walter White says ""Chemistry is the study of change"" This is the main theme of the series, change. Watching his descent into evil or how the creator of the series (Vince Gilligan) put it ""You take Mr. Chips and turn him into Scarface"" is one of the most riveting things I have ever experienced. Bryan Cranston plays him to perfection. He has received 5 Emmies total and all were for this series, 4 of those 5 were for his performance. Anthony Hopkins wrote him a letter saying that he gave the best performance he had ever seen. Not to mention Aaron Paul was just as phenomenal as Jesse Pinkman, who is easily the most tragic character I have ever witnessed. At the beginning of the series, though was very likable and funny especially with his constant use of the word for a female dog, he was not very bright. But as the series continued he became more mature because of everything he goes through. Their conflicting relationship was one of if not the best thing of the whole series. Clearly this series in a very good way takes lots of inspiration from classic westerns. In particular ones that were directed by Sergio Leone. The cinematography from Michael Slovis is beautiful the series has a very distinct look from other TV Shows. Vince Gilligan said in an interview that film noir was a source of inspiration for the series, which makes sense considering that many of the shots are very noir esque.

But overall, Breaking Bad is without a doubt the greatest TV Show of all time because of the fantastic acting, directing, writing, character development, cinematography and so much more.

10.0,22 November 2019,"I fell in love with the show and i felt sad when it was over , this is one of the fewer shows that you can't find any plot hole , it was done perfectly, developing of the character walter white from season 1 until season 5 is just brilliant!! You feel that this a true story not acting !! One of the most interesting things about this show is that it makes you change your ideology and your values and you find your self have sympathy for a criminal and even support all the decisions he is making! ON the contrary you hate his wife skyler just because she doesn't support him ! But the truth is she is the one who is right ! He is a criminal and yet we viewers find ourselves encouraging criminal's actions !! One of the best ever !"

1.0,9 October 2019,"This show is the best of TV, there has not been another show that I have been so invested in from beginning to end I was hooked, there was never a time where I thought ""can this show ever be over"", in fact when it did end I wanted more! (something Vince brought up in an interview was he wanted to leave on a high note and leave the audience wanting more). There was never a time that I hated a character that was meant to be liked, I felt exactly as Vince Gilligan intended for us to feel about every character, I loved them when I was supposed to, I hated them when I was supposed to, I cried, I laughed, I got chills, my blood ran cold, and I felt at the end like I knew the characters and was personally involved. Vince and co. should be proud this show was the result of firing at all cylinders and several things lining up perfect at the perfect time to create a show that cannot be forgotten.

There hasn't been a show this good and I'm not sure there ever will be again, and if there is then I'm pretty sure our minds couldn't handle it"

10.0,25 November 2021,Brba was good once and good crime drama but is not a thriller subject over all I predictable screen plays and Twisted and turn very poor thing. And Charcater was good one Good choose Water white and Jessie character personal Jessie character like it. By the way Brba was Normal drama crime catagory not worth it.
10.0,28 April 2020,
10.0,29 July 2021,"This is a great show like others have said, and my take is that this series has a little bit for everyone. It's a show that the family can sit down and watch together, except children of course. It has the drama, thriller aspects, action, and great writing and dialogue to make this show one that's hard to not like. It's a bit slow, but has a way of only having a few things happen over and hour and yet so much gets accomplished.

But with all that said, for me it was about Gus Fring. Once he entered the series it became a masterpiece. Seasons 3 and 4 may be some of the best work ever done on a cable series. Giancarlo Esposito's performance in this show outshines the rest for me. I'm reviewing this in the middle of season 3 my second go round watching this show."

10.0,27 July 2019,There are many unnecessary things in the plot. It feels like they didn't use their common sense at certain episodes. Overall it's the worst series except for the acting.
10.0,5 January 2023,"I don't really watch a lot of series to be honest. Most start well and then drag on for too long and get dull. This had me hooked from the beginning. Amazing acting and script. Every show as enjoyable as the next. Every day I look forward to what happens next.

I thoroughly recommend this. It might not appeal to everyone but for me it is the one of best shows and oddly enough I did not want it to end. I say oddly enough because I don't like watching so many shows for the reasons I mentioned. It,works for companies because the likes of Netflix, a prime etc make more money with their monthly subscriptions.

There are some violent moments but this is to be expected for a whole like this. There is also some humour as well. It might be occasional but smartly done.

I thoroughly recommend this."
10.0,18 June 2023,"This show is one the of most rated for a reason, although for many it seems to drag, to me, everything is near perfect. The pacing, the characters, the development of the plot, and such in depth writing. Breaking bad will never be overrated, period: it will always be the best. There's nothing more than what I can say, that wasn't been said before. If you haven't watched Breaking Bad, watch it. If you haven't finished it yet, finish it. Don't miss out on the hype because this show deserves it and this is the one of the times contrarians can go suck it, because they are crazy to rate this show any lower than a 5/10. I know my review won't be seen by many, but at this point, I just wanna talk about one of my favorite shows."
10.0,25 May 2019,D&D take notes!!! This is show you nail an ending to a masterpiece of a show
10.0,31 July 2023,"Watched it 6 times now, have to watch it again to remind myself of this incredible story, yes some parts are slow at times but it leaves you on amazing cliffhangers each time that you just end up binge watching it a season at a time, Bryan Cranston plays the part of Walter White brilliantly and Aaron Paul the part of Jessie Pinkman starts off very cheesy but really grows into his character and seeing the emotional battle his character goes through is very moving, if you haven't watched this yet then firstly have you been living under a rock? If so then log onto Netflix and watch it immediately."
10.0,4 March 2023,"Best tv show ever produced! It started with slow pacing and you can argue it was done purposefully as it gave us time to get be familiar with the different characters, but when it took off, it became a perfect journey till the end. From the acting to the story everything is just perfect with... Just finished rewatching it 10 years later and it was still captivating as the first time. The walter white character development was superbly done, and Bryan acting was just pure greatness, so much so that when I got to the ""Iam the danger"" monologue, I kept rewinding it over and over, that just so satisfying to watch."
10.0,20 December 2020,Little them people knew back in 2008 that they're going to witness one of the greatest TV shows ever.
1.0,16 August 2015,"So this is the one and only movie or television show I've ever given a 10. This is the best television show I've ever seen. Nothing else has ever rung more true than the script and performances in BB. Nothing more I can say about it. Perfect script, casting, acting, cinematography, foreshadowing, this is the benchmark now for TV and I'll be waiting for some ambitious genius to come along and try and take its heavyweight championship belt away. Watch it 2 or 3 times to take in all the juxtaposition and appreciate all the nuances. I'm not perceptive enough to catch it all the first time around. Bryan Cranston's extensive comedy experience lends just the right amount of levity to keep this drama true to life. Just go watch it. It's brilliant."
10.0,26 December 2021,Definitely one of the best TV shows i've seen in my life! A very good and accurate (imo) presentation of drug dealers. The ending was also done well and did not disappoint. Recommend this show to everyone!
10.0,5 March 2024,"Everyone has gone on and on like this is some awesome show. Let me say brilliant acting performances from all cast members and it has its high points ... but 80% of this show is just horrible. How this became a cult classic is totally baffling! Walter and Jesse are always at the receiving end of something dreadful thru the entire show. It's as if they are dumbest criminals that never get out of the hole they first get into. WOW... you're left wishing for something good to happen to Walt but from the very start he gets the shaft- from medical conditions to Jesse's stupidity to bad luck, trouble and death! What utter nonsense so I give it a 4 because the performances were fantastic.... What a shame it was on this show!"
10.0,8 May 2020,Breaking bad from season 1 it started good with how was walter white from the beginning and how much he love his family and continue in maximizing the performance in the next seasons arriving to season 4 where we can say it is the best like i give it 10/10 and finishing in season 5 with an amazing greatful ending. From my opinion i can say it is the best serie that you can watch in your whole life.

10.0,31 January 2020,"I was stuck with GOT, then the ending disappointed me. Then I was recently watching The 100s and I really likes it till the after the second season when Clark and Abby appeared to painfully annoying and then it kept drowning. OMG why I kept ignoring this? Thanks to my friend who made me watching the first episode, then you know, I believe you know what happened, I literally stuck with it with all of my likeliness. This is the best series I ever saw, and I dare to say it is the best series ever created, The characters by Bryan and Aaron are so perfect and the story, writing acting everything is perfect. You will love it and I know you already love it."
10.0,22 April 2024,"The greatest series in history in my opinion I have watched this masterpiece more than once, and one time I feel that it is the first time I have watched it, and the same enjoyment is repeated This series depicts the lives of addicts and the lives of dealers in a very real way, unlike the rest of the cinematic works, which contain a large portion of exaggerations, but the utmost magnificence is in describing the life of Jesse Pinkman and the great transformation of the character of Waterwhite into Heisenberg.

Also, Hank's character was more than great from my point of view, and he was able to fulfill his role as a police officer and as a member of Walter's family in a wonderful way.

Water Junior was more than great in his role and was more than brilliant Let us not forget Michael, I love him very much. He is truly a great person, and everyone involved in this work is wonderful."
10.0,2 September 2021,"When I first saw this show I was in shock. Everything was just perfect. A genuine piece of art.

7 years after the show ended, I'm still looking for something that compares. And I guess I will just never find it, everything else is below, as great as it can be.

So this year I decided to rewatch it. At first I was afraid my opinion on it would evolve, with time and all the nice shows I've seen since. But the thing is, just the opposite happened. I'm still struck by how absolutely perfect and unique this show is.

I realised that during its course, the whole show, just as it's characters, evolved season after season, from something absolutely perfect, to something else different but just as perfect.

Two words come to my mind when trying to describe it : epic masterpiece."
10.0,21 April 2020,Only just now watched this series and it is a masterpiece. Walter White is truly the embodiment of evil.
1.0,28 April 2022,"Never in my life have I seen a show written and directed as good as BB .

This is one of the only shows that kept me watching for countless hours straight.

10/10 no complains to this show."
10.0,25 August 2017,"The bad thing about watching breaking bad a second time is that you can't watch it a first or a second time ever again. The good thing was that I liked it even more than the first time. So if you are waiting for a TV show with a similar excellency, watch Breaking Bad again.

If I had to summarize Breaking Bad in just two words, it would be ""just perfect"". And I mean that in every way possible. The script, for instance, never makes a ""mistake"". The entire story, in all its exceptionality, makes perfect sense. Never a enforced situation. It's like, once characters were placed, the script wrote itself.

Besides the mind blowing journey and the astonishing performances of the actors, I would like to mention two other features that outclass all other TV shows by far : the conversations (so real,so natural and yet so powerful) and the non-conversations as in ""one image tells more than a thousand words"". Brilliant !

(english is not my native language, so pardon me if some words or phrases are unclear)"
10.0,15 November 2019,"They could have put all the episodes of every season just into the length of a movie. It's the same thing over and over again.

Eyes glazed over many many times watching the episodes, would never watch again 👎🏻"
10.0,24 September 2019,"The most gripping, engaging show I have ever seen. So many scenes where you are on the edge of your seat anticipating the next event. On rewatch, you realize things you haven't realized before, it is crazy how good the writing from Vince Gilligan is. There are no concrete good guys or bad guys, just characters you despise or root for. CANT WAIT FOR EL CAMINO!"
10.0,27 September 2021,Anyone that thinks this show is bad must be on something because it has single-handedly surpassed every show I've watched since. 11/10.
9.0,30 July 2023,"I heard about this show a lot by my friends and colleagues so I finally watched it, and yes it was the best decision of my life lol.. I can confidently say that it is an absolute masterpiece and a show that truly stands the test of time. From the moment I started watching, I was hooked by the gripping storyline, the phenomenal acting performances, and the impeccable execution of every aspect of the show.

Breaking Bad excels in every department. The acting performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White being a masterclass in character development. His transformation from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord is utterly mesmerizing. Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman is equally brilliant, and the chemistry between Cranston and Paul on screen is simply outstanding.

The show's writing is top-notch, with each episode leaving me on the edge of my seat, eager to find out what happens next. The drama, suspense, and thrill are perfectly balanced, creating a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the series. The character arcs are well-crafted, making us deeply invested in their journeys and choices.

Breaking Bad's attention to detail and storytelling finesse are unparalleled. Every plot twist and turn feels natural and unexpected, keeping the viewer engaged and constantly surprised. The character-driven narrative ensures that even the supporting cast leaves a lasting impact, adding depth and complexity to the overall storyline.

In my thought, Breaking Bad is a timeless gem that will be remembered as one of the greatest shows in television history. Its exceptional performances, intense drama, and well-crafted storytelling make it a must-watch for all generations. It is a show that will stay with you long after you've finished watching. Personally, I wholeheartedly give it a solid 9 out of 10, reserving that one point as a tribute to its unforgettable impact on the world of television."
10.0,22 May 2022,This show is so amazing and the chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is worth it alone. So much good drama and overall the best show I've ever seen.
10.0,4 September 2022,"Breaking Bad in combination with Better Call Saul is the best I've ever seen. I loved every single aspect about the series. The first episodes may appear weird when you watch them for the first time, but over time you realise how good they are. For me, every season and every episode is a masterpiece, especially The Fly (S3, Ep. 10). If you haven't watched it yet, please do it and don't stop after the first episodes, trust me, it gets better the more you watch it. There is a reason why the season is rated 9.5 out of 10. So what are you waiting for, start you streaming platform and watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul afterwards!"
10.0,26 July 2021,That's great at all. It's the best serials I've seen ond it will be best.
1.0,22 December 2023,
9.0,21 December 2020,"This webseries is best for all age people's. Actors are really hard worked for this legend, masterpiece webseries."
10.0,12 August 2023,"Rabid fans: just because you don't agree doesn't mean the review is unhelpful -- that's not what the ""No"" option is for. For those who can think critically, read on.

I was on the hype train when it was still on the air. I think everyone was amused by the premise and especially getting to see Bryan Cranston take on such a serious role. (Before BB, he wasn't necessarily an obscure actor, but nobody knew him from anything besides ""Malcolm in the Middle."")

Looking back, having rewatched the entire series at least four or five times since it ended ten years ago, it comes off as a show designed to trick stupid people into thinking it's smart (I was one of them.) You can find countless pieces of media debunking virtually everything the Walter White character does. My problem with this is the fact that the show deals with actual chemistry and science accessible to all people, and not made-up fantasy science. But the show handles science as if it IS magic.

Some defenders of these errors might claim that it's ""just fiction"", but I resent that because one of the show's selling points was that it appeared to be very realistic. The people involved with this touted their consultations with real chemists as a testament to its authenticity, so what are we supposed to think? I think this is harmful in the long run because it only makes people more ignorant to how things really work, and the American public is already painfully ignorant to the fundamentals of science and nature itself.

The way BB alternates between realism and comic book style nonsense is very strange, and I suspect this was not intentional. I understand the pressure on writers to come up with suspensful and exciting developments in a story, but I don't think you can have it both ways. Is it realistic or is it a cartoon? I don't think the writers were able to make up their minds. The reason this is so detrimental to the show and its internal logic is because once you know and understand the errors -- nothing that happens can be taken seriously. It's like the character himself says (to paraphrase): in science or math, it's either right or it's wrong.

Take the train heist for instance. The whole premise of it is laughable once you know that the kind of methylamine they would realistically need would be anhydrous, not aqueous. See what I mean? If you're going to do a show about a genius chemist, you might need to take it more seriously. Errors this large would be unthinkable. It seems like the writers attempted a cursory understanding of maybe one aspect of the science, and then rushed into writing a story without thinking it through.

Everything from the manner in which Walter causes an obnoxious guy's car to explode (by laying a squeege on the battery) -- to the way he gases the thugs in the RV -- to the bathtub incident, makeshift RV battery, etc. Is impossible. All the way to the end of the show, everything that happens is impossible. Probably the only accuracy is the production of the meth, but even that is flawed -- because the writers demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of methylamine from the beginning to the very end. (You can make it with household chemicals...) Also -- Giancarlo Esposito's Spanish is horrific. He sounds mentally disabled to anyone who speaks the language, so the thought of any of these cartel people taking him seriously is hilarious. Seriously, if it was this bad he should have been written to speak English only. And his character being Chilean makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Have the showrunners ever seen a Chilean?

Despite this, my biggest problem with the whole affair is in the narrative. These characters are downright awful -- characteristically and in terms of writing. Yes, you are mostly dealing with bad people, but there's no silver lining or any warmth. The story and characterizations make no sense. It feels very contrived and manipulative, as if the writers were so desperate to make you pity this character that they had to construct an implausible scenario consisting of one-dimensional stereotypes, shallow explanations and questionable motivations.

You're telling me this guy is that smart but he couldn't find a better profession than high school education? We're even shown in the first episode that he has a Nobel Prize framed on the wall. The show teases throughout that something went wrong with a research start-up between Walter and his colleauges, but we're never given an explanation, and I suspect the writers didn't know either. It was also a baffling and idiotic creative decision to establish a clear connection between Walter and his high school chemistry lab (for which he was the only one who had the keys) via the gas mask found in the desert -- as early as episode two -- and nobody suspects him despite his background in chemistry? How stupid is this version of reality the story takes place in? I know people like Hank in real life. He would have been suspicious immediately and even if he wasn't -- the DEA would've suspected Walter -- and Hank would have been taken off the case as a potential conflict of interest.

His family is an odd, Hollywood contrivance that is supposed to make us feel bad, but they only serve to irritate. It seems like the writers hold a disgusting view of lower middle-class American families. In the commentaries, they even admit to decorating the set of the White household intentionally tacky and garish, which is really a reflection of how insufferable Skyler is (Walter's wife.) Maybe Skyler wouldn't have been so maligned if you had actually written her as a human being. She irritates before Walter even considers cooking meth. And then there's the son, Walter Jr., who has cerebral palsy, which is an obvious inclusion to make you feel that Walter is justified and was dealt a bad hand. But the problem is that his personality is as strange as Skyler's, almost as if the characters were written by aliens.

If they just HAD to produce a show about a desperate man who turns to manufacturing drugs, they could have written the characters -- and especially the family -- as real people. I would never argue with the notion that American society is sick and the way we live is odd compared to the rest of the world, but there's still good people here, and nobody I've ever interacted with behaves the way this family does. If you wanted to make me feel bad, you would write this wife as a sweet and loving person with depth and convictions of her own.

If they wanted to justify the unjustifiable, maybe raise the stakes. Maybe Walter's son needs an operation and he has three or four more children, which would make sense because he's fifty. Upgrade him to at least a community college or backwater university lecturer. Have him be conflicted about doing this and really explore the psychology of this criminal activity. It doesn't make sense how he just unleashes this monster as soon as he is diagnosed with cancer.

The drama is also very forced and has an edge or frequency that is like having too much coffee or something. People bark things at each other through gritted teeth, Walter's lying is not smart enough for someone of his intelligence and many things are left unsaid for no reason. This show is like misery porn which Americans disturbingly can't get enough of. Even more disturbing is the way people root for Walter. I've even come across discussions online where fans are saying they would engage in this kind of activity under similar circumstances -- if they knew how and could get away with it.

I'll never understand why people are obsessed with darkness. This darkness is not even appealing or convincing anyway. None of the material is nutritious food for the mind, spirit or intellect. When it's over -- what are you left with?"
10.0,7 September 2021,"I had no faith in cable tv. I stopped watching. Almost every show is absolute garbage. If there was a good show, it would eventually and drastically dip in quality. This is the one show that actually got better each season. Which is so unheard of. By the end of season 3 I thought, ""how could this possible be topped?"" Guess what? They topped it and then they topped it again. The writing is actually amazing. Cable tv shows are hard to make. I'm not gonna deny that. The actors are not as good, the effects and writing are not that good, and even sometimes the cinematography isn't good. Here it's absolutely outstanding.

Please trust me. I am one of those people who cannot stand cable tv because it's so lame and poorly made. After watching this you will you see how horrible every other cable tv show is. I know people like some shows like Criminal Minds, NCIS, Modern Family and many others. I did not enjoy those shows. The Walking Dead is actually pretty good but compared to this it seems so cheap. Cable tv is lame for the most part. This is honestly far above the rest in every single aspect. I'm so glad I watched this and I highly recommend this. Watch it."

Without Breaking Bad Netflix wouldn't have been the force it is today! Breaking bad was never show in UK for some reason none of the channels brought the rights, In Ireland TG4 bought it with was a Irsh language channel which no longer exists, this is how I first watched Breaking Bad. As of early 2024 there's talk of another Breaking Bad series or film! Probably won't happen, here's hoping it does.. Would love to see a cross over of Breaking Bad & Ozarks! Could work both brilliant series's, both evolved around the same subject matter, both have references to the cartels and both brilliantly written?

10.0,17 April 2022,"*no spoilers* If you're reading these reviews wondering whether to start this show all these years later, the answer is yes. The writing, the cast, the cinematography, the music... It's all as good as it gets. Can be a slightly slower start for some, or hard to get into, but by the end of season one, you will be oh so hooked. The transformation from a high school teacher to, well, what he becomes, is like no other and begs your attention. This is a must watch for everyone."
10.0,25 September 2020,"Breaking Bad has impeccable acting & screenplay. Story is not based on just a light entertaining popular theme but is kind of grim, dark and goddamn serious with intriguing plots smeared with intelligent humour at times.

The experience is worth it; it's on Netflix, the entire season is available in one place (I see you Mad Men), the soundtrack is impecable and the acting is out of this world (specially my boy Jessie). See, in the end I can't hide my liking to this amazing show."

9.0,14 September 2016,"Have you ever heard your parents say to you something on the lines of, ""You weren't alive for any of the great shows back in the day."" Well, if you were born >2000, I'd say you were. ""Breaking Bad"" is such an amazing show. The producers and script writers knew exactly how to get you to connect personally with the characters. They're just so relate able and real-life. It seems like they're just recording the lives of the cast because the actors play their roles beautifully. Many will tell you that it's ""over hyped"" and i say, yes and don't you think there's a good reason for it? It's very difficult to not spoil anything

so i'm just going to tell you the bear minimum so you can go watch it yourself The main character, Walter White (Bryan Cranston (also played in ""Malcom in the Middle another good show) who is in a dead end teaching job AND car washing job full of very disrespectful students. During his 50th birthday, he almost seems left in the dirt behind his sisters husband, Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) who is a cop that is bragging about a massive drug bust. He goes on a ride along with him when he spots one of his former students fall out of a window. You can find out the rest by watching yourself. You WILL NOT regret it. I promise the beginning is very slow but for good reason. The first couple seasons are explaining the characters lives."

10.0,26 April 2022,"So this is my third time re-watching breaking bad. It has been several years since I have re-watched it. And I am rewatching it because Better Call Saul last season is airing and I want to binge watch it. In 3 days I have watched 22 episodes. And all I say is it is better than I ever remembered. Yes, people say it is slow. The 1st season was great second season was a little slow but once you get to season 2 ep 11, this is where it takes off full force. The acting is probably the best of any TV show I've ever seen and I think that's why the show is so good. The cinematography is phenomenal and I can't say anything bad about this. This is truly an amazing experience, that everyone needs to witness once or twice in their life. I cannot wait to binge watch Better Call Saul!"

10.0,12 February 2023,"Breaking Bad: Best Features

Gajendra Gautam Tell me the best thing about breaking bad we series

""Breaking Bad"" is widely considered one of the best television series of all time, and there are many reasons why this is the case. Here are some of the most highly regarded elements of the show:

Complex characters: The characters in ""Breaking Bad"" are richly drawn and multi-dimensional, making them both relatable and unpredictable.

Tight storytelling: The writers of ""Breaking Bad"" did an excellent job of pacing the story and building tension over the course of the series. Each episode leaves the viewer wanting more.

Exploration of morality: The show asks thought-provoking questions about the nature of right and wrong, and the consequences of our actions.

Cinematography: ""Breaking Bad"" is visually stunning, with cinematography that captures the beauty and harshness of the Southwest landscape.

Acting: The performances, particularly by Bryan Cranston as Walter White, are universally acclaimed.

Attention to detail: The show's creators took great care in creating a believable world, and the little details, such as the costumes, sets, and props, help to bring the story to life.

These are just a few of the many reasons why ""Breaking Bad"" is such a beloved series, and why it continues to be held in high regard years after its final episode aired."
10.0,15 September 2023,"Breaking Bad is a groundbreaking television series that offers a thrilling and tense look at the consequences of one man's descent into criminality. It is expertly crafted, with powerful performances from its cast, slick cinematography, and a well-written script that consistently surprises and captivates its audience.

The show's appeal lies largely in its ability to create nuanced characters who are both relatable and deeply flawed. Protagonist Walter White, played by the immensely talented Bryan Cranston, is an underachieving high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Through a series of unfortunate events, he turns to manufacturing methamphetamine to provide for his family's future after his death. What follows is a gripping tale of morality, corruption, and ultimately, redemption.

The series is also notable for its attention to detail. From the music cues to the intricate world-building, every aspect of Breaking Bad has been carefully crafted to create a complete and immersive story. Even minor characters are given fully-fleshed-out backstories and motivations that add depth to the show's narrative.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone who loves gripping dramas and complex storytelling. Its legacy will undoubtedly continue to inspire and captivate audiences for years to come."
5.0,11 June 2020,Great work. Thank you to the author and actors for this great masterpiece
10.0,22 December 2023,"Well i gotta say, S1 was really nice, some of S2, but halfway from there things got too boring and also disgusting.

So many scenes were so disgusting i felt that i want to puke and nothing else.

Say boring a couple of times. And also Walter's character is WEIRD. His lil bud too, sooo damn weird. They shout alot too.

Sex scenes are weird and awkward, seriously cancel them.

Killing, running, etc.... C'mon, how about a story and a plot.

Anyways watch Season 1 its really nice, got a nice story, with various angles to it, but it goes downhill from there. I mean acting is a job too and those people just wanna make some bucks."
10.0,1 October 2022,"This show is amazing and I just became so hooked and fixated on the plot and the characters and what's next in the story making me binge it as I was eager for more. There will never be a show this good ever again. Vince Gilligan ended it perfectly and with El Camino it was a pretty good Epilogue. I wish it never ended but it's a shame to say all good things must come to an end. The cinematography in this show and all of its spin-offs made me rewatch it numerous times, a feat no other show could do. Thank you Vince for this amazing show. And thank you to all the actors who made it so we quote them on a daily basis. I hope to see more from the Breaking Bad universe sometime in the near future."
10.0,8 September 2022,"Watching this again, again... again again again again again again... or maybe for the seventh time... Wait a year and rewatch and it always gets better and is still fresh... Breaking Bad is the greatest cable series ever filmed... They tried with Better Call Saul to make it seem like everything that happened here already happened but this is liken to a neo noir where an average guy inadvertantly takes down an entire criminal operation... It all happens here first, folks: it was made first and it happened first, and the chemistry between all the characters is perfect: starts out more a dark comedy, a Coen Brothers/Tarantino kind of thing, and then escalates into if Scarface was as great as Goodfellas and, what else can be said?"

10.0,17 August 2021,"I think Breaking Bad is one of the greatest series ever made.

It has successfully combined brilliant writer (Vince Gilligan), directors, actors (Brian Cranston and Aaron Paul and so many more) to come up with this genius masterpiece.

Every episode will get you hooked and on edge as you witness the amazing life adventures of Walter White and how he managed to juggle his life being a father, a husband and on the other side a genius meth cook for drug dealers.

It is dark, brutal, yet so hillarious at times and emotionally engaging.

I never felt this level of emotions watching the series. I just root for Walter to survive and never get caught or killed.

It makes you realise how life is not about just good vs bad, or black and white.

Every back stories just made sense and justified the actions took by good or bad people.

Besides Walt, there are so many characters you will love. Jesse, Mike, Saul, even the villains like Gus Fring and Salamancas are awesome.

Definitely a must watch show."

Walter White, Jesse Pinkman(hate this guy), Hank Schrader, Guss Fring, Saul Goodman and Mike Ehrmantraut are the names I won't ever forget.

Although this in my opinion is the best of the bunch and my personal favourite Season ranking 5. Season 1 4. Season 3 3. Season 2 2. Season 4 1. Season 5."

10.0,10 April 2020,"This show is fantastic. Nothing superficial or supernatural, just a good story. I loved The Wire on HBO and GOT and West Wing was solid, but none of them are as good as BB. Still a great show after many years."
10.0,25 January 2023,
10.0,14 February 2021,"I just finished watching this show for the third time. This show has humor, it has humanity, it has ambition, it has greed but most of all - this show has a personality. A personality that develops as it gets older. When this show ends, it feels like saying goodbye to a dear friend. We'll meet again in a few years. Until then...goodbye."
10.0,2 March 2023,"Breaking Bad is one of the most iconic TV shows of all time, and for good reason. The show, which originally aired from 2008 to 2013, follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine to provide for his family after he is diagnosed with terminal cancer.

The show is a masterclass in storytelling, with each episode building on the last to create a complex and compelling narrative. The characters are all fully realized and multi-dimensional, with even the smallest roles given depth and complexity.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of remarkable. He manages to capture the character's transformation from a mild-mannered high school teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin with incredible nuance and subtlety. Aaron Paul is equally impressive as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner in crime.

The show is also visually stunning, with expertly crafted cinematography and editing that adds to the tension and drama of each scene. The show's use of color is particularly noteworthy, with each episode's color palette carefully chosen to reflect the mood and themes of the story.

One of the show's greatest strengths is its willingness to explore complex moral questions. Throughout the series, the characters are constantly forced to grapple with their own moral compasses and the consequences of their actions. The show never shies away from the darkness of its subject matter, and the result is a powerful and thought-provoking examination of the human condition.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone interested in exceptional television. The show's superb acting, intricate storytelling, and thematic depth make it a true masterpiece."
10.0,2 July 2023,"Breaking Bad is a testament to the power of television as an art form. It pushes boundaries and challenges the conventions of traditional storytelling, leaving a lasting impact on its viewers. It has rightfully earned its place among the greatest television series of all time.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is an extraordinary television series that deserves every ounce of praise it has received. With its compelling characters, intricate storytelling, and outstanding performances, it stands as a landmark achievement in the world of television. Whether you're a fan of drama, suspense, or simply appreciate superb storytelling, Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch that will leave you craving more with each episode."
10.0,13 February 2021,Nothing to say no words... GREATEST OF ALL THE TIME. Watch once in your life time. No series or movie in the that compares the breaking bad. You can't get out of your had. My Baby Blue😢
10.0,8 May 2020,Amazingly beautiful where each character has been portrayed so well.
10.0,15 September 2021,"What can I say that hasn't been said. The acting, the cinematography, music, the writing and the story, all the best I've seen in television history. Words cannot explain the masterful peace of art that Breaking Bad is. I could not stop watching. I recommend it to the max. One of the greatest shows now and forever."
1.0,19 April 2023,"So, i just finished all five seasons over the course of about a month. I really expected more based on the hype. The premise was good, and of course Cranston's acting was great. But the over-the-top stupidity of nearly every action taken by the characters was so distracting as to make the first 4 seasons almost unwatchable. Season five definitely ended with some great closure, tying up all the loose ends, and the final scene was satisfying (which earned it 4 stars instead of 1). But when so many characters, particularly Walter, Skyler, and Jesse, repeatedly make the most moronic decisions and show such an inability to behave in any way rationally, it undermines any affection we might develop for the characters. I found myself saying ""That was so stupid, you deserve to die"" multiple times in virtually every episode. Even the most bumbling, moronic person could lie better than these idiots! And making Skyler a raging hateful lunatic throughout the series made it impossible to believe that Walter would go through any trouble for her whatsoever. Meh, good riddance to this mediocre show."
10.0,12 April 2020,"I'm not joking, this is one of the best TV series ever created....only bettered by Mr Robot and maybe The Madalorian. The problem with it is (and it is a problem) the scenarios take a lot of setting up, like pushing a boulder up a hill. Sure when they reach the crescendo all hell breaks loose and it's excellent, you just have to sit through an aweful lot of sub plots... It is amazing, totally believable and pure madness/genius. The performances are top rate and the whole setting is a beautiful backdrop. I watched the entire series back to back in a few days, best way to do it as there's a lot to digest. So don't miss out on the excellent series. Like I said, one of the best ever produced. Oh and look out for the Pizza scene...that was a fluke and kept in for effect...you'll know what I mean!"
10.0,24 September 2019,This is definitely the best series I've ever watched :)
10.0,11 August 2022,
10.0,4 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece in television history. The show's brilliant writing, exceptional performances, and breathtaking cinematography make it one of the best shows ever made.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of iconic. He takes us on a journey from a struggling high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin, and every step of the way, we are completely invested in his character. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman is equally fantastic, and the chemistry between Cranston and Paul is one of the main reasons the show is so compelling.

The show's supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Giancarlo Esposito as the terrifying Gus Fring, Anna Gunn as Walter's wife Skyler, and Bob Odenkirk as the sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman.

Breaking Bad's storytelling is expertly crafted, with each episode leaving us on the edge of our seats, eagerly anticipating what happens next. The show's use of symbolism and foreshadowing is also masterful, and the attention to detail in every aspect of the production is impressive.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone who loves great television. It is a modern classic that will be remembered for years to come."
10.0,5 May 2020,"Maan, this if you don't watch it's a loss! Greatest ever!"
10.0,13 November 2019,"I've never written a review of a television show in my life (46 years) and I never believe the hype. However, this is quite simply the best series I've ever watched that maintains momentum from start to finish. The writing, the character development and the chemistry form a perfect blend that stands apart from every other show. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are brilliant together. Congratulations to the writer and cast for this masterpiece. This is an experience you'll never forget and no review can ever capture the rollercoaster ride and magic that is Breaking Bad. The reason that I have written this review is that true art and talent should be celebrated."
9.0,9 April 2020,"Greatest TV show ever, sitting thru all the families breakfasts and boring meetings id worth the wait! GOAT"
10.0,24 August 2022,It is a show you can never not come back to. And it feels like a new show every time. Such a great show with alot of depth that isn't seen in the 1st viewing experience. Can't recommend it enough.
1.0,17 October 2022,"Made it about halfway through the first season before I refused to waste anymore time watching it, only wasted a couple of hours but I still regret it because of how bad it was.

Somehow a show about drugs that's actually worse than requiem for a dream, I literally didn't think that was possible but here we are.

Fans of this show are worse than Game of Thrones fans too, always shouting about how its the best thing to happen to humans since fire was discovered.

Maybe one day I will re-watch it and really enjoy the show, after all lobotomies and shock therapy are still performed in certain places."
10.0,12 June 2019,This show is the best of all time what a fantastic show and actors
10.0,27 December 2023,"Prepare yourself for a thrilling, emotional, and unforgettable ride through the Albuquerque underworld. A must-watch, a modern classic web series.

Breaking Bad is not just a TV series; it's a rollercoaster ride through the moral shadows of a man's soul. This groundbreaking show, created by Vince Gilligan, doesn't just break bad - it shatters conventions and expectations. From its intense character development to its mind-bending plot twists, Breaking Bad is a tour de force in the world of television.

Breaking Bad doesn't shy away from exploring the dark recesses of human nature. It delves into the consequences of choices, the thin line between good and evil, and the moral decay that can consume even the most ordinary individuals. The writing is sharp, the cinematography is striking, and the soundtrack complements the tension perfectly.

Each episode is a cliffhanger, leaving you on the edge of your seat and craving more. It's a high-stakes game of cat and mouse that will keep you guessing until the very end. Breaking Bad isn't just a TV show; it's a masterfully crafted journey into the heart of darkness that will leave you breathless and haunted."
10.0,27 January 2023,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece that has and will always live up to its hype. The story is extremely well-executed, the characters are complex and relatable, even despite their heinous acts, with a few exceptions ofc (looking at you S4-5 Waltuh), the setting is unique and interesting, and the pacing is top tier. That being said, some episodes are kinda slow or uneventful, but as a whole the series is bound to keep you at the edge of your seat, building suspense and tension that will always make you excited for what will happen next. Additionally, it explores a bigger theme of trauma and masculinity and explores how said themes influence the events and the characters themselves. As unsympathetic as Walter does become towards the end, he is still somewhat understandable due to being an underappreciated and ignored despite his brilliance (tho one could argue that it was at least partially self induced). The same counts for characters like Jesse, Saul, Gus, and Mike, who are forced into the lifestyle due to problems beyond their control. Overall, this is a masterful and influential show, and while I may or may not rewatch it, I will always treasure it and hold it close to my heart."
10.0,2 September 2020,
10.0,10 July 2023,"Consider this show one of the greatest of all time. This show has an insanely crazy character development that would leave you absolutely mind-blown. The characters and their work is absolutely perfect and on point. This is not for the weak of heart who can't understand this beautiful masterpiece. But yes this is one of the greatest the TV industry could ever offer the world.

I agree at some point the show might be a bit slow and boring, I would not say it as boring rather prolonged story that's it but if you give it a shot then the show won't be disappointing at all it's all worthwhile when you understand it."
10.0,23 August 2022,"This will remain the greatest show of all time, the acting, the story, the camera visuals, the character development, the beginning to the ending is amazing. Literally the only show in my opinion with a good ending."
10.0,25 May 2020,.I can't explain what exactly feels after finishing last episode
1.0,28 May 2019,One of the greatest if not the greatest show of all time
10.0,25 August 2022,"Never have I had such boring 40-ish minutes as the ones spent watching episode 10 of the 3rd season. The whole episode they were hunting a fly with dramatic scenes to show how worried Walt is.

All episodes are the same: ""wanna be strong"" intro, Walt has an irrational and totally unrealistic breakdown, Jesse does something stupid, episode ends weirdly and lame.

I wont mark this as spoilers because it is impossible to even spoil this show, as nothing really happens."
10.0,27 April 2020,Best ever Tv series/show Globe.....
10.0,2 October 2019,"Seriously. This show is no joke. Years later, it still holds up against other shows. It truly is the king of television, and should stay that way."
10.0,18 January 2022,"The best show ever. I watched plenty of drama series but BREAKING BAD its just awesome. The greatest show I have ever watched. Thank you for this great master piece.

Engaging level is really really high.....Everything is so perfect from the very beginning and how they relates chemistry with our lives of families... It's just incredible and hats off to the makers.... You had created probably the best series on the planet Every small scenes describes the perfection they put in this..... Every character has their own taste ..... Science and a family fan is a deadly combination .... If u start once, there's no going back ... You'll skip all your assignments just to witness this masterpiece."
10.0,6 February 2021,Walt jr really did eat breakfast for 5 seasons huh
5.0,8 October 2019,"This show was by far one of the most enticing dramas I've ever seen. If you don't typically like crime shows involving drugs, don't let the premise of this show put you off... It's much more than a typical drug fueled crime show."
10.0,19 November 2022,"I watched better call Saul first.

It was really good.

Then tried to watch this Breaking Bad show.

Unwatchable.

Takes a concept that would be good for a two hour movie and just bloated it with tropes to make multiple seasons?

The fly episode?

It's a good reminder of how bad tv used to be.

Especially amc.

And the Malcolm in the middle dad's acting is so overrated.

Take some lessons from Odenkirk, dude.

Wasn't he like in the next trailer?

Or even the Pinkman actor?

Or the Ehrmantraut actor?

I'm glad the makers figured out how to make a show without tropes and avoid mediocre actors by the time they got to better call Saul."
10.0,20 August 2014,"I do have to say this is one of the best TV series i have seen in a while. it has everything drama ,action , drugs and more . i found the first series to be very light hearted in comparison to the rest of the TV show as Walter is starting out and really doesn't know what to do and is afraid at everything. After the episode in the first series where he is Nico's place (i think thats his name not sure)and blows it up with a meth look-a-like bomb, he starts to realize he gets a buzz from what he is doing and from there on he slowly develops into a man who you can hardly recognize as Walter wight.i do think the second series out of all of them was kinda weak in comparison to the others as Walter takes a break from dealing drugs and it focuses more on character development.Over all i think this TV show is incredible and Bryan Cranston's performance was truly amazing especially since this is the man from Malcolm in the middle. Aaron Paul was very good in this also and you get to see how Jesse slowly spirals down from confident to timid and you can see how the events of the series have effected him greatly."
10.0,24 July 2020,"When I started Breaking Bad 10 days back, I was wondering how can a series score an average of 9.5 on IMDB from over 1.7 million reviews! Today when I finished the 5th and final season, I can surely say, even 9.5 feels less. Watch it guys if you haven't. It's probably the greatest Television Drama ever created. Has easily surpassed my previous favorite Sherlock."
10.0,25 April 2020,Must watch web series You will get addicted of this what a fantastic web series it is i don't have any words to describe that how fabulous this web series is
10.0,13 November 2020,It's everything everyone is saying and more. What else do I need to say?
10.0,7 May 2022,"When I saw Breaking Bad for the first time, I just thought, like every time.. what is this again. But then after a few episodes it grabbed me like never before. I have to honestly say that this series captivated me. The closer we got to the next episode or season, the more exciting it became. The storylines were simple but still exciting and entertaining. This series grabbed me not least because of these talented actors. What a fascinating role they played and how they conveyed it in an identical way so that the viewer could be involved in the series. They managed to organize an entertaining party in every episode, which was filled with suspense, sadness, comedy and shock moments."
10.0,11 August 2018,"This is undoubtedly the best series I have ever watched. Have watched it through 3 times... the characters, acting and writing are all fantastic. Best thing on Netflix."

9.0,9 September 2022,"If someone asked me ,,what's a perfect show in your opinion?"" I would say Breaking Bad. I know this is not a ,,hot take"" but believe me, this show is as good as people paint it to be. Breaking Bad is and will be a timeless classic, I'll not be surprised if in the future folks would analyze it in schools like lectures. It is already analyzed in film related universities and colleges because of how good it is. It's next level writing, difficult topics and social commentary makes it the best Drama series there is. It also contains one of the if not the most iconic endings I've ever seen - this show will not leave you disappointed. Easiest recommendation I've done."
10.0,24 July 2020,"I cannot express the joy and pain and sorrow this show has brought me. I'd heard that this was the greatest show ever but it was only now in July 2020 did I watch it. and boy was I hooked! I could easily binge seasons 1 through 4 but season 5 took its toll on me. I couldn't get myself to watch it without being either stressed or sad or on the edge. Walter White is the most extraordinary character ever on any television show. There are so many scenes that just break your heart and it only gets sadder while still being able to execute the impossible. The closure of every character just makes it all the more satisfying when it ends.

This series is the best show ever in television history and I think I will be watching this over and over again."

The harmony between concept, casing, acting, writing, directing, design, cinematography, editing, score and sound design are sublime."
10.0,8 September 2020,Not a good show writing-wise and the cinematography is awful. Wasted actors on deplorable show.
10.0,31 December 2018,"This show is just the best. It's smart, witty, suspenseful, heartbreaking, and just great all around. The acting in it is amazing and the writing is brilliant. I don't think there will ever be a show of its caliber. If you haven't watched it by now, I highly recommend it."
9.0,18 January 2022,"A very beautiful series. I was distinguished by the wonderful actors, director, writer and camera crew. Really, this work is the best filmed by a camera that exceeded imagination with its beauty and mighty might."

10.0,23 February 2020,Overall it was just amazing Especially loved the way it ended
8.0,30 March 2020,The best tv series ever.totally original script from start to finish and acting was off the chain. What he's it about 40 times back to front and watched different eps so many times. Season five my favourite season and episode 7 to 16 in season five is completely amazing
10.0,31 March 2020,"This is the first ever series I watched and I shouldn't have done so. I liked a couple other series after this, but nothing can beat this. Period. Breaking Bad is a different experience! It feels better to rewatch this, than to try enjoying some new trash."

10.0,4 August 2021,Most of the episodes are dull as hell and the acting isn't up to much.
10.0,1 October 2019,"Finally this is a show which meets all the requirements of a perfect show, various storyline but it is never confused and continues streamelining to the felina; acting is on spot especially Aron Paul;does justice by ending in 5 seaaons;ploys are rock solid and editing is the tightest on any TV show;and finally the show is never full of itself - it remains a show about water white."
10.0,6 October 2023,"This is great television. Just perfection. Breaking Bad is a well told story with amazing directing and amazing acting. The story is so believable and well thought out. Bryan and Aaron's character developments make so much sense and add so much to the story. This is the best television series. All of the camera angles and set dressing was superb. The details were well thought out. I have watched this series twice now and will probably watch it again. There are many lessons in cinematography, directing, acting, and set design. Skyler and Hank's characters are also so very well played. Wish there was another season lol."
10.0,7 May 2022,"This show is hands down one of the best shows i've ever seen Plot:9/10 Drama:10/10 Characters and character depth:10/10 Main character:10/10 well the question is why i didnt put breaking bad as a 10/10 show i think the only flaw of this show is season 2 the pacing of that season was at its slowest and in some episodes were even boring,but season 1,3,4,5 are all incredible and season 5 is one of my favourite seasons of all time the pacing and the story writing is just top tier Ozymandias:10/10 to hajilele:10/10 felina:10/10 face off:9/10 this show has also one of the best episodes in the tv history ozymandias.to hajilele and felina are just in another level of story writing

my only problem with this show is season 2 and how boring it can get(even season 2 is not that bad its a 8 or 7.5 ) every season except from the second one are just incredible and it has top notch writing This is a MUST watch show,if you havent watched it go right now and watch it,seriously its a crime to not watch this show :)"
10.0,23 February 2020,This show is too addictive I watched all the seasons in one week every person should watch how the Heisenberg's and gustavo fring's minds work The war of brains.it made me feel badass and I loved Jessie's character.
10.0,12 November 2020,This is definition good cinema (tv). Every episode leaves you wanting to see how to story as a whole ends. You fall in love with every character and their arcs are fulfilled perfectly. Every actor is superb. Some of the shots are so beautifully executed. Absolute must see!
10.0,26 September 2021,"Breaking Bad is easily my favorite TV show and is objectively the best one out there. I've never been more captivated by a show than this one. It's filled to the brim with excellent writing, directing, cinematography and acting. Props to Vince Gilligan, he really did create something that feels like lightning in a bottle. The acting, man, there is not one bad or mediocre performance in this show, everyone is fantastic, the standout of course being Bryan Cranston as the chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin, Walter White/Heisenberg. Cranston really was the perfect choice to play this role. Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is excellent in this show as well, and there are a few scenes with him in the last season that nearly made me tear up.

The show is undeniably slow, it takes its time with its story and characters to add more depth to them, and it has the potential to be boring, but when the scenes are this well written, this well shot and this well acted, I was never bored. And the characters are extremely well written to keep you invested in the story. But then it also explodes on you with shocking and badass moments that are definitely worth the wait.

The main premise of the show is a chemistry teacher. Diagnosed with lung cancer, who gets into drug dealing to make money to provide for his family before he dies, but it's so much more than that. It's about change, how a person can become entirely different from who they were due to greed. It's about the price a person has to pay in order to do something they want to. It's about a person trying to do something that will help his family, but instead leads to the destruction of it.

Overall, an absolute masterpiece of a show that I think everyone should see at least once in their life. It's one of the few shows that has consistently stayed phenominal from start to finish."
10.0,15 February 2021,This is quite possibly the best drama series I have ever seen. It is even better than The Sopranos. Every episode is compelling. The characters are phenomenal and the acting is even better. It is also well written.
5.0,13 June 2020,"I am a very judgemental person when it comes to TV shows and movies, often critiquing them for minor details. I never once did this with Breaking Bad. It has a couple issues but I can say hands down, without a doubt in my opinion, it the best show of all time. It will hook you from the very beginning and you won't be able to stop watching with all the twists and turns the story takes. 100% recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it."
10.0,6 January 2023,"I had to force myself to watch until season 1 episode 6 because the show is very boring and it mostly just shows what Walter White's life is like and it just feels like it was originally filmed for a reality TV show and then a production company picked it up and turned it into a tv show and the show can easily be summarized as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman cook meth, they find someone to distribute their meth, their distributer gets killed, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman panic about how they will now distribute their meth now that their meth distributer is now dead, Jesse Pinkman and Walter White separate for a few episodes because Jesse doesn't want to cook meth anymore and Walter has to take care of his family, Jesse and Walter get back together and rinse and repeat until the end of the show."
9.0,17 January 2022,"Wow, this show is masterpiece, everything is perfect including the Fly episode, i love how breaking bad works, and this show holds me in an incredible way, i always want to know what will happen next.

This show is the best show ever."
10.0,6 September 2020,"I did love breaking bad, so much fun memories, i thank the director"
10.0,14 January 2022,I thought hank's and Gustavo's character was flawlessly played. The annoying character was skyler. Other show thrived on constant cliffhangers. Probably one of the best shows of our time.
10.0,5 September 2022,"Brilliant acting Brilliant story line.

Came to the party late and binge watched this masterpiece am I so glad because the suspense of waiting a week for the next episode wound have been unbearable.

There hasn't been a series as good as this one and can't see how anything can top this which is quite depressing as anything I watch in the future would be judged by comparing it to the brilliant Breaking Bad.

Obviously without giving anything away it revolves around the drug trade and is pleasing that it certainly doesn't glamorise the trade in anyway.

Brilliant writing as the main character I felt sorry for and understood his motives but by the end I wanted only bad things to happen to him as he seems to enjoy his business.

As mentioned Brilliant acting there honestly was not one bad acting performance by the whole cast."
10.0,27 December 2019,I have no ords of this series of how good is really is....

10.0,4 April 2020,"The show is superbly written ,the acting is sublime I could not fault any of the hundreds of actors in this show every one from large parts to the smallest delivered a faultless performance and you will want to binge watch from first episode and be sad when you reach the series finale Not many shows score a 10/10 from me and the only ones that do have to be that good I would sit and rewatch the whole series and enjoy it as equally as I did when I first watched it! This is one of those rare gems!"
1.0,6 December 2021,"The actor is Bryan Cranston, as Walter White. He's a high school chemistry teacher. Because of family economy issues, he starts to sell drugs.

Because it's just so boring and boring and boring and boring to watch it over again but it's just boring and annoying and annoying and annoying and it's not worth the effort to watch the whole show is boring and pointless and pointless and it's just so much drama and boring and pointless it's not worth watching the same show every single time it's boring it's boring it's boring it's not even worth the time and effort and I hate that it's just so annoying it's so annoying it's so boring I don't understand it I just want it and it's just don't understand why people don't.

10.0,10 May 2020,"A brilliant show from start to finish. It's intelligent and character driven, displaying beautiful arcs in ways that often leave viewers feeling emotionally conflicted. It makes decisions that you convince yourself it won't make, ties together loose ends appropriately, and understands the importance of remaining true to characters. It would like be a full 10/10 if I didn't find Walt so unbearable."

10.0,29 April 2020,No words can rightfully describe the experience. The best ever. Watch it
10.0,25 September 2021,This tv show changed my life in a very good way. Forever will be my favourite tv show.
10.0,9 April 2020,"This is the best show that has ever been written. It's beautifully shot, beautifully acted and fantastically put together."
1.0,10 April 2024,"This is honestly one of the greatest TV shows of all time. We watch Walter White, a pathetic, un-macho man teaching chemistry with a pregnant blonde wife, a son with Cerebral Palsy's, and an upcoming daughter, to a Drug Lord named Heisenberg. The story is absolutely fanomanal, showing the change of a man, fear, manipulation, and consequences and more in only 5 seasons, with each scene playing out perfectly with epic cliffhangers. Not just the incredible story, but epic villains as well, with extreme emotion, and really makes you really hate them. It is honestly incredible seeing all the changes within 5 seasons. I really do recommend this show, it is really an experience."
10.0,5 December 2016,
10.0,8 July 2019,This show got so much hype and I don't know why it is good but so boring in most of the episodes
10.0,1 October 2019,"The only thing I could say about this masterpiece is that, I wish I could erase my memory and watch it over for the first time again. I've seen this 4 times through, and you will never see a show like this again."
10.0,15 November 2020,"In my whole little life I have ever seen this type of series. Really amazing that's no dought. There is no superhero no friction no but I still love it. Mr White is a genius. The last season is realy unbelievable.

I think this type of series will never make 💗"
10.0,16 August 2017,"Just finished watching. best TV show of all time. love it very much. this is what i call art. love last moment with skyler. but most heartbreaking for me was to see jesse like this. he was broken and killed from inside. i cried a lot on final moments but, hank's death wasn't showed by the best way"
10.0,7 February 2021,I have and will never watch a better show than Breaking Bad. It has changed my life and has completed my knowledge and understanding of everything. Thank you so much Vince Gilligan for making cinema even better.
10.0,21 December 2023,"THE Greatest Show Of All Time.

This is my one and only review so far on IMDB and I just had to say something about Breaking Bad

To start... a perfect cast, that acted perfectly. Bryan Cranston portrayed his character so unbelievably well.. because he was so believable & relatable, emotional, expressive, good/evil. Truly amazing, he should have won all the Emmy's. Same with Aaron Paul. The whole cast complemented each other so well.

The writing is top tier drama and action... to paraphrase 'A chemistry teacher with cancer decides to cook meth to provide for his family.""... to turn this brief synopsis nto the show we see today, is remarkable. The details in each episode drove the plot forward and made a fictional story seem realistic and possible. The plot had clear moments of rising action, a climax and a fall that lead to an actual conclusion (unlike other tv shows)... Truly an overall complete story. Hats off to the writers, specifically Vince Gilligan

Lastly, the directing and cinematography is brilliant. It ties the acting in with the writing. The unique camera angles lighting, sounds, lighting and wardrobe (that changed as the plot thickened) added depth, suspense and made the show much more gripping.

Overall... there is no other show that competes with Breaking Bad. Thank you for making this for my enjoyment!"

1.0,28 October 2020,"Best ever seen TV series. Watched it now 4 times and I am kinda scared watching something else, as I might be disappointed anyway. Breaking Bad is a simple masterpiece of its own. Tight, tight, tight...Yeah!"
10.0,10 April 2020,"The best ever tv series i had ever seen in my life. The plot, the acting, the sound mixing, the cast everything is damn perfect. Every action has an equal an opposite reaction i had seen. The life of a high school chemistry teacher tells us a lot of thing that a man can do everything, he became a teacher, he became a drug mafia, he became a family man. The acting of Bryan Cranston and Aron Paul is awesome. The series has 5 seasons plotting with his all life how time can change humans life. How problems came in your life and change everything."
10.0,18 March 2023,
10.0,14 August 2015,"Yeah for me The X-Files is the best show I've seen in my life but Breaking Bad is also awesome (yeah two different genres i know but in their genre this two are the best) As Walter White's drug lord status evolves this show does it too from zero to high hero (!!!) The guy evolves from cooking on a RV to his own lab i mean awesome!!!! No words just awesome and Pinkman is also awesome no wonder why this is in the Guinnes Book of Records as THE BEST SHOW IN TV IN HISTORY...

Honestly watch this show this worths a watch seriously Breaking Bad is the best of the best...

Watch it!!!!"
10.0,29 August 2020,"Just go and watch it, it's amazing.

I checked the rating when i was thinking of watching it, and assusmed no way a drama thriller could be 10/10, but after watching this show, I realized i was so wrong. So, you should also experience this show, it's the best."
10.0,1 December 2018,If you haven't seen breaking bad you need to see it.

10.0,4 May 2020,Awesome. Loved it. Enjoyed every bit of the story. 😍
9.0,12 June 2019,"Started with a pace, slowed a bit here and there and the last season showed the actual crux of what everyone was waiting for, a surprize, refreshing and left a mark on stone series. I was stunned many times how Walter plays the game. You are alone, all alone, you know you have chosen the wrong path, a path without a u-turn and in the span of time everyone either hates you or is your enemy. A protagonist had turned antogonist and you feel sorry and disappointed. Jesse is all messed up, somehow because of his crazy friend and once a teacher. However, the last season made me sorry, ironically, and i built a real sympathy for Walter. The way he tries to make things correct, almost for everyone and dies of what was known off. You know, sometimes, you know the hard part and the ending but still cant face it. I will no doubt give this series full 10 out of 10."
2.0,20 June 2021,"There was a few episodes that was slightly boring but the rest of the episodes was purely entertaining, if you loved this I recommend watching El Camino."
10.0,25 September 2020,"...you will never watch a better TV-series after watching Breaking Bad. I've re-watched it 7 times!! Everything is amazing about this show; the story, the characters, the actors....

You have to watch it!!"
10.0,27 August 2021,Overrated show focusing most on talking . So slow I watched all the series in a day by just skimming.
10.0,6 November 2015,"This show is as addictive as the drug depicted in it. This show not only brought on laughter, tears, and a sense of fear... but the realization of the true potential Bryan Cranston has to be the greatest actor of all time.

If you are considering watching this show, you must do it. As odd as the description may sound, it is incredible relevant. I found myself connecting with the main characters more than I would like to admit. It drew out emotions in me that I never thought a TV show ever could. It may sound a bit over the top to say something like that... but you can only understand by watching this show. Never have I EVER seen any actor preform as POWERFULLY and CONVINCINGLY as Bryan Cranston did in this series.

This show proved me many things... but the message that will stick with me forever, is that we all ""Break Bad""."
10.0,28 June 2021,"BB is not just a show, it is emotion and love. The best ever show I have seen in my life."
10.0,20 July 2020,"The GREATEST show on planet Earth. Make no offence but if you haven't seen this show. You living a worthless life, lol."
10.0,16 October 2014,"Dark comedy starring an Anti-Hero with a PhD in Chemistry who is the baddest dude on TV since Dr. Quest & Race Bannon put together. A pregnant wife, a thankless job, lung cancer, no insurance, and a son with cerebral palsy to drive him nuts. A sleaze-bag lawyer named ""Saul"" played (and probably written) by a former Saturday Night Live writer. A puppy dog sidekick ""Jesse Pinkman"" who is a severely flawed but impossible to hate. A serene drug kingpin so smooth and endearing you would give him your children to baptise. A bad-ass republican DEA agent who always gets his man, even if it's his brother-in-law. There is enough moral conflict in this show to sink the titanic. Nobody escapes with the innocence intact!"
10.0,6 April 2019,
10.0,8 September 2021,There will never be a show like breaking bad again.
1.0,23 August 2022,"This is my second favorite show after 24, i saw the ranks it was getting so i decided to see it and found out that it deserves all the ranks its getting, the story is sooooo good from the beginning to the ending it just gets better."
10.0,10 February 2022,"The worst ever tv show seen my life.

Very very boring season 1,2,3 Season 4,5 ok ok Predictable every screen play and Twisted not engaged one And Worst Cinematography, and OST very worst part.

So not worth it deserve 1 rating."
10.0,28 May 2023,
10.0,4 February 2021,"I watch a lot of TV and have probably watched close to 100 different TV shows, but nothing comes close to the standard set by this masterpiece.

Every aspect of Breaking Bad is perfect, the writing, acting, story arc and pacing. The only show I've seen that actually gets better each season.

Breaking Bad will never be topped. Better Call Saul is great, but just doesn't fill that void, so I'm now re-watching BB for the 4th time."
10.0,14 June 2020,
10.0,10 May 2020,"Its a great TV show.I would have rated it a 10! Period! The plot, the screenplay, the script, the storyline, the dialogues, the acts, everything about Br.Ba is just awesome."
10.0,20 April 2022,"I watched this with an open mind not reading the reviews but watching it because of friends saying it was so good, well that was the understatement of the century!. Has you gripped from start to dramatic finish. We now are about to watch the last series of Saul and after that watch breaking bad all over again. Chicken man is still my favourite, so cool but utterly calculating. Perfect and so mo much better than any woke rubbish out now."
10.0,14 January 2022,I watched perfect from each side plot drama action this serie is pure gold i recommend it to everyone i know my favourite episode was ozymanides that episode was absolute fire.
10.0,22 January 2020,"Words can't describe the acting/screenplay/sound design/score/cinematography/direction/ oh, did I mention acting?"
3.0,19 October 2023,"I have never watched a show this amazing , all the characters have performed extraordinary And this still remains on top of my list after all these years.

The acting was perfect, the storyline and script of the show was very good; the way everything takes place and how the plot suddenly thickens when something significant happens is certainly very good. The plot twists were very surprising and interesting.

Another thing I really like about this show is how Walter changed from a poor weak high school teacher to the biggest meth kingpin of America running the largest meth manufacturing operation in US history."
10.0,4 October 2023,"Do you ever watch something and recognized that it is objectively good, but you still aren't enjoying it? That is how I felt about Breaking Bad. I will admit, I didn't finish the whole show, I watched into season 3, at which point friends told me that if I wasn't enjoying it yet I Probably never would. I found that I didn't really understand any of the characters or who I was supposed to be ""rooting for""? In the beginning you want Walter to be able to help his family, but then that all kind of gets lost and messy in the middle. Without something or someone to keep me hooked I just didn't want to keep me going. The acting is great. The writing is great. Its just not for me."
10.0,13 November 2020,"I'll admit it, I did not watch Breaking Bad during its run. In fact I got tired of all the chatter/accolades about the show. One evening this October, I decided to watch S1 E 1 on Netflix and about 10 minutes in I was hooked. I binged the entire series and was utterly blown away. What an experience, every actor was so perfect, captivating stories and one of the best finale's I've ever watched. Still thinking about some of the scenes and will for some time I imagine. To anybody like me that has/had not watched it, do your self a favor, carve out some time to watch this amazing production."
10.0,28 December 2019,"My favourite TV show. I have watched it like 20 times, it's just soo good. It's also consistently good, which is rare for a TV show as most seem to have atleast 1-2 weak seasons, but not breaking bad, each season is a solid 9-10.

If you haven't seen this show and you are on the fence about watching it, then stop reading and get it on, it will be best decision you ever make."
10.0,29 April 2022,"I have no words to describe this great series but I had watched this series 2 times and I want more, I actually loved it so much and I hoped it never end. No one can make best than this show and no one can act like Bryan."
10.0,25 December 2023,
10.0,10 June 2020,"I watched breaking bad because my cousin said he couldn't decide what his favourite show was. I obsessed over each detail of the show watching the podcast and the explanation of each episode and making sure to know every detail. It's a puzzle that I thoroughly enjoyed witnessing.

P.S. Watch El Camino & Better Call Saul too."
10.0,13 October 2023,"Watched during pandemic. Thought I was gonna hate it. Probably the best show that has ever been created. Bravo to everyone involved in this - from storylines, production, & even the extras! Walter White will live forever in the world of important characters and Bryan Cranston will live forever in the world of television.

From beginning to end, gripping. Can't remember how long it took to watch this show... maybe a week? Best week of entertainment in my life. This story highlights being driven by passion, capitalism, dedication and the will to do anything to feed the hungry monsters inside of every human that lives."
10.0,5 September 2022,"This is the greatest TV show of all time. I have just rewatched again and can continue to rewatch at least once a year. The show never gets old!! The actors are phenomenal and it's a nonstop adrenaline rush especially the last season. How is it possible to finish an entire series and immediately you want to just start it again? It's just that good and when someone tells me they've never seen Breaking Bad I can't believe it. This show is a MUST WATCH!! Heseinberg!!!!! One of the absolute best characters in TV history. After watching Better Call Saul, I'm happy we finally get the Saul Goodman conclusion. I hope they can revisit the universe one day and show us what's up with Jesse and maybe even Skyler and Walt Jr. It's such a fun universe and although the show has concluded there's more to do there. You will not be disappointed watching Breaking Bad."
1.0,12 June 2019,I was like in an oscillatory stage whether BB or got....which is the best .....and yall knw got s 8 was a massive disappointment....I wud scream aloud that BrBa is the greatest of all !!!!

9.0,30 August 2019,"Well i was a GOT fan till season 7 thinking i hit the jackpot but a friend of mine recommended and rather insisted that give Breaking Bad a go. 4 days later afyer actually watching 5 seasons (yes in 4 days) i was blown away, yes i couldn't get out of the chair, i practically skipped work just to watch more - That's how addictive this show is. New Standards - i have never ever seen a show stand alone over all the freaking shows ""Historically"" as Breaking Bad did. Masterpiece is an understatement! Watch it of you haven't. compared to GOT this show wins by 200% atleast!"
10.0,25 May 2020,Everything about this show is just so perfect! You get hooked to the show right from the first episode and it keeps you on the edge of your seat till the finale. All the characters are well written and impeccably portrayed by the actors! Direction and cinematography is top notch. All in all this a kind of show which will stay with you for a long time.
10.0,29 August 2022,
9.0,13 October 2023,"I haven't seen any other tv show with such an interesting and iconic roster of characters all together. The pace between the one season to another and one episode to another is just incredible and it keeps you amazed throughout the show. I don't know if I will ever feel the same when I saw the last episode ""felina""...it was the perfect ending for me and almost all the characters got what they deserved. Furthermore Walter is the best written character that I have ever seen and the show has the most iconic tv show villain of all time, Gus fring. In conclusion, I don't think there will be another tv show as perfect as ""Breaking bad"" and ""Better call Saul"" in the near future and to whoever that haven't watched breaking bad yet I have to tell you that you are missing an absolutely perfect once in a lifetime tv show experience."
10.0,14 September 2016,"Masterpiece of the author Vince Gilligan. This series has a bow very special dramatic; Where if you start very slowly to Discover characters.

3.0,19 August 2013,"I must admit, I was weary about watching this at first but others I trust told me I need to watch it. Since the first episode I am hooked. Having lost my father to Cancer I find it hard to watch this but the emotional roller coaster has been one hell of a ride. This story is raw, gritty and compelling. Acting is expertly done and Bryan Cranston is my true hero. He brought his extensive career and it really shows. I can pick no fault with any aspect of it so I wont even try criticize. If you are reading this because you want to know if its worth watching then stop right here and just watch it. If you are reading this for any other reason then know that I love this title and everything about it."
10.0,26 August 2022,"And they call got has a worst ending wait until you get to this one.

----------------------- Or let me do you a favor and skip the entire show for good. Here you only waste your time with stupidity and lazy writing & of course the yellow signature filter that Hollywood keep putting it, god knows how many Mexican movies or show they have used.

----------------------- By the end of this show you will either have diabetes or already have it within the first second of the show.

----------------------- If i have a time machine i would have erased my memory or even kill the old me to spare him the nonsense of this boring stupidity of this show."
10.0,23 August 2022,"I have no words to describe how crazy is this show. Season 1,2 are just Normal begining. Then boooom in season 3. You may be addicted since beginning of the season 3. Must watch this show before you die."
10.0,2 June 2023,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece that will forever hold a special place in the annals of television history.

The show's central character, Walter White, portrayed flawlessly by Bryan Cranston, undergoes a mesmerizing transformation from a meek, high school chemistry teacher to a feared and respected methamphetamine manufacturer. Cranston's performance is nothing short of astonishing, effortlessly capturing the multifaceted nature of Walter's psyche. His nuanced portrayal balances vulnerability, determination, and an increasingly dark and morally ambiguous path, leaving viewers both mesmerized and haunted by his descent into the depths of his own creation.

The writing on Breaking Bad is a masterclass in suspense and tension-building. The intricate plotlines, expertly crafted by showrunner Vince Gilligan and his team, keep you on the edge of your seat, constantly questioning the characters' choices and motives. Each episode is meticulously constructed, weaving together moments of nail-biting intensity, shocking revelations, and profound character interactions.

Breaking Bad not only delves into the gritty world of drug trafficking and the consequences it wreaks upon society, but it also explores the profound effects on relationships and the human psyche. The complex dynamics between Walter and his former student-turned-partner, Jesse Pinkman ( by Aaron Paul), provide the series with emotional depth and an exploration of the consequences of one's actions. Their chemistry on screen is unparalleled, delivering some of the most powerful and heartbreaking moments in television history.

The attention to detail in Breaking Bad is astonishing. From the breathtaking cinematography to the meticulously chosen soundtrack, every aspect of the show contributes to its overall impact. The visual aesthetics, symbolic motifs, and clever use of color effectively enhance the storytelling and evoke a range of emotions, creating an immersive experience for the audience.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is a true television gem that sets the bar exceptionally high. With its outstanding performances, intricate writing, and powerful exploration of the human condition, it remains an enduring testament to the power of storytelling. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates exceptional television and is ready to embark on an unforgettable journey into the dark side of brilliance."
10.0,16 January 2022,"It's an old serie but I actually just managed to watch it! And so glad I did since it's bad ass, ground breaking and entertaining ass hell. Walter is such a strong main character and it's truly entertaining to see the character grow. Acting is truly skilled and there is dry comedy springled a cross the episodes. There some episodes where you feel like they are repeating stuff for sole purpose of coming up story, but it's a very small flaw in the glass."
10.0,19 July 2017,"All of the characters in BREAKING BAD are flawed (many very deeply), and they all make mistakes and, sometimes, baffling choices. The line between good and bad isn't clear; in fact, nobody comes off looking particularly good here, including Walt's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris), who's brusque and often insensitive. Some episodes move a bit slowly, while others have more momentum -- sort of like Walt himself, as he tries to cope with the mess his life is becoming.

Cranston's phenomenal performance is the best thing about the show. Forget the spacey, clueless dad of Malcolm in the Middle. Walt may be tired and beaten down, but Cranston manages to bring enough dignity to the man that it's possible to believe him when he's acting like an idiot and being socially responsible at the same time (such as when he narrowly escapes the bad guys, then tells his drug dealing partner, ""We have to clean this up"")"
10.0,28 August 2022,"Breaking Bad is genuinely the best... piece of media that I have consumed ever. You grow with all the characters, it's funny, you hate Jesse the first season or two, he's annoying, full of himself, rude etc. You're more rooting for Walter, he has cancer, he's doing what's right for his almost family of 4, but, on the final episode, that's changed. Jesse is the only one you cheer, the only one who's outcome makes you happy. But Walter, you're glad his fate is what it is, you hate him, he's evil and immoral, very far off from the beginning of the show where he was terrified with the fact of taking a life. It get's to a cutoff where the show barely revolves around the production of meth, it's more the people who make them and who they associate with.

I say this final part confidently, if you are to watch this show, LOOK UP NOTHING ABOUT IT, your enjoyment will increase tenfold if you do, I am not kidding, research nothing."
10.0,5 December 2018,"This is considered as one of the greatest television shows of history. Critics and fans alike love this show.

Me personally was blown away by it.

It is created by one of the ""X-Files"" creators, so there is no surprise.

But this is one of the most uniquely dark television drama on a man's journey to perdition and we see it's inception.

We see madness, internal struggle, violence and drugs.

This reminds of Tarantino, Rodriguez, Ritchie and Joe Carnahan. A dark comic take on violence.

Bryan Cranston as Walter White is amazing. One of the best television experiences so far.

Overall - 4/5"
9.0,10 November 2015,"The Staff writers of ""Breaking Bad"" managed to turn it into a rare series of television landscape. Although quite a successful series captured the screen with the season, sweeping quality, but very few were able to reproduce the same initial success and prove themselves even during periods that came later. Creators of ""Breaking Bad"" managed an impressive juggling walk on thin line, and for five seasons maintained a high standard of plot, aesthetics and attention to detail. These were signed for a brave decision to avoid tricks screenwriters or vague questions and provide a series an clear,complete and rewarding end."
1.0,30 July 2021,Im so happy to be alive to have seen such a serie!!!!!!
10.0,12 April 2023,"It supposed to be 5 stars but I wanna lower the ratings of this show, why? Because this show is too over rated. My time was wasted for watching this. It tried my best giving this show a chance until season 2 but it's been a while, when I was watching season 3 I was like why I am watching this most ""BORING"" series of all time. Nothing happen every episode, it's bland, boring, no fun, lots of talking without sense. They say it's the best in writing but i can't see it. It's a good show but i wont watch it for its plot. The character arc are not suprising. I suggest not to watch this and I don't recommend this show. Trust me, this is the most boring series you've ever watch. Great acting but too much drama and too much talking. I was like watching a problematic family and other bad relationship that has no sense at all."
10.0,23 December 2023,"The best show of all time When I first decided to watch it, I only watched 4 episodes because I thought it wasn't suitable for me. I decided to watch it again with an open mind. And I found this to be the best series of all time for me. I won't lie to you. I've watched it more than three times now. It's very realistic, unlike acting. It's realism, life, art, great acting. Filming techniques, soundtrack, and other elements I don't want to say this at all. But there has probably never been a better series in my life. Who hasn't seen it yet? And found this article So I want you to open your mind. You definitely won't be disappointed."
10.0,15 June 2021,"I watch this when struggle in chemical in high school.which really give me thought weird to say it,engery to carry on,n hope i can get good great grates under the power of Heisenberg!!love it so so so much!"
10.0,15 May 2019,"The best serie, ever! Not even game of thrones could beat him."
10.0,30 April 2022,"I liked it very much. I absolutely love everything about this show. I have never seen so much beautiful series in my entire life, the actors are amazing, scenario is outstanding."
10.0,20 April 2022,"The best show ever to hit TV. Every single box is ticked in this show. Casting sublime, writing extraordinary. If you haven't watched this yet get watching."
10.0,12 February 2024,"Heisenberg is the greatest character in TV history. I loved Tony Soprano but Walter White took the top spot from him. The character development is excellent. There are so many layers, it can be difficult to decide whether you're rooting for or against him. I personally never stopped rooting for him. Don't let the ""slowness"" of the first season turn you away. They take their time in building the character and it's worth it.

Cranston's portrayal is genius. Even among some great writing, incredibly interesting characters, and an intense multi-layered storyline, Cranston's acting is what most commonly stood out to me the most. Several times I just shook my head and stated out loud what a talented actor he is.

Giancarlo Esposito (Gus), Jonathan Banks (Mike), Aaron Paul (Jesse), Bob Odenkirk (Saul), Raymond Cruz (Tuco), Dean Joseph Norris (Hank) are all excellent in their roles and Mark Margolis as Hector Salamanca is one of the most underrated / under appreciated acting jobs I've ever seen.

The relationship and banter between Heisenberg and Aaron Paul's character really carry the show throughout and is never not entertaining. This dialogue alone makes the show worth watching.

The reason I give this show a 10 when others of superb quality got less is because there is an ending. A real one where loose ends are tied up. There's nothing worse than investing in a series just to be left sitting there looking like a fool after some open ended finale. You don't have to worry about that here.

A+"
5.0,9 March 2023,"There is absolutely no bad sides of Breaking Bad. It is so perfect that I will never give smth 10/10 because Breaking Bad is so great that this will be unfair to Breaking Bad. It has perfect acting and perfect storyline. If you think it's probably overrated(ngl i thought it was too) you are definetely wrong. At some point you just want to go and scream with all you've got because of the events. Every single side character of Breaking Bad that has an actual role in the show is written and acted as great as every single main character of the shows I've seen by now. I don't want this to spoiler you so I will not give any more details about how great it is. Just go, watch the show and see what perfection is. (sorry for bad english not a native speaker)"
10.0,27 April 2023,"The series represents the ability of a person to destroy his life in just two years, from when Walt turns 50 to that emotional scene in the cafeteria when he turns 52. Walter represents the destruction of everything around him and of his person, that physics teacher who only taught classes. During the series you can see a progress in the character in his way of being with his family and his attitude with the outside, which will cause that change of person. This whole plot revolves around amphetamine and consequences of the lies made by Walt, which will always harm the people around him.

In my opinion the character of Hank makes the series much more expectant since he does not trust anyone or anything."
10.0,22 December 2018,"Breaking Bad features Bryan Cranston chewing the scenery like mad in a desperate bid to show that he is a Serious Actor while everything around him is Three's Company.

Jesse and his buddies are morons; Walt's sister-in-law wears nothing but purple.

The writers seem to have learned how human beings talk to each other only from watching other TV shows.

During the final season the cinematography takes a turn for the Very Serious.

Breaking Bad is supremely delicious camp on the order of Showgirls.

1/10 if you take it seriously 10/10 if you watch it as camp"
10.0,5 March 2023,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...t's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All ou have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If ou're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed."

10.0,29 December 2023,"I've just rewatched Breakinf Bad for the second time and I still come to the same conclusion that this is in my top 5 shows of all time! The storyline, the characters, the acting...everything is cinematic perfection! The most fascinating of which of course is Walt's slow demise and how it begs the question...what are we capable of? As nice, middle-class 'normal' people - what is our threshold? Throughout the show you will relate in some way to the character whilst at the same time being completely mortified by some of his actions - brilliant! If you haven't watched Breaking Bad...firstly - where have you been? And secondly - do it...watch it now!"
10.0,24 October 2020,I have seen many tv shows and series but none can match the level of these amazing series:) I wish I can erase my memory and watch it again
10.0,25 August 2022,
1.0,4 January 2023,"Breaking Bad is, without a doubt, one of the greatest television series of all time. From its captivating plot and complex characters to its exceptional production and execution, this AMC series has everything it takes to be a masterpiece of television.

The protagonist, Walter White, is masterfully played by Bryan Cranston, who brings to life a character that undergoes a dramatic transformation over the course of the series. As White immerses himself in the world of methamphetamine trafficking to earn money for his family, his life and character change dramatically, and Cranston handles this transformation convincingly and thrillingly.

The supporting cast is also solid, with standout performances from Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, White's partner in the meth business, and Anna Gunn as Skyler White, Walter's wife. The supporting characters are also interesting and well-developed, adding depth and complexity to the overall plot.

The production of the series is also top-notch, with stunning set designs and photography, as well as an impeccably selected soundtrack. Each episode is a visual and technical masterpiece in its own right.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a series not to be missed. Each episode is thrilling and full of unexpected twists and turns. It is an epic story about ambition, loyalty and betrayal, and is undoubtedly one of the best television series ever produced."
10.0,12 October 2021,Brba good one but not a 9+ rating western drama crime concept was good but screen play very lag one and Predictable screen plays and twist. And water white character good one but last season ending disappointed me.
10.0,15 September 2020,"I just wished that Walter White turned himself in before Hank got killed, maybe after years of imprisonment, he may get his redemption 😔"
10.0,6 April 2020,"This is by far the best series of all time, with special mention of the character development which was exactly how it is supposed to be."
10.0,17 April 2019,"This tv show, as mentioned in the title, is more addictive than meth. Although it has a slow start, every episode comes with something surprizing. You start loving Walter while you hate his wife when suddenly you realize that Walter is the villain. Great show!"
10.0,3 January 2019,"Now this is what i call a classic crime genre series. Just perfect start and perfect ending. Go for it guys right now, you will just love it."
10.0,16 March 2023,"About a couple of months ago I finished my first viewing of Breaking Bad, and it was a fantastic watch. It felt like each season got better than the last, topping itself with crazier and more impactful endings. Now, because of clips and such all over the internet, I'd been aware of Breaking Bad for a long time before I actually watched it.

So, unfortunately, pivotal and heart-wrenching moments got spoiled for me. Despite this, the show never failed to entertain me throughout its runtime. I regret not watching it until now as it truly is one of, if not the best show I have ever watched. I seriously recommend viewing Breaking Bad if you haven't already."
10.0,25 November 2017,
10.0,11 September 2023,"Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb (even after 1.8MIL+ fan votes!!) and it's one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavor. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Just a total Package 10/10 show."
2.0,3 June 2024,"Breaking Bad is one of the most amazing TV shows ever created if not the best. It's amazing how they grabbed a very original idea and transformed it into a beautiful masterpiece there's nothing in breaking Bad that makes no sense everything is there for A Reason. You can watch the show over and over and over and you will still find something else that you haven't seen before.

Breaking Bad has definitely made a line of before and after. The acting the direction the production the footage everything is just perfect it's amazing to see how hard someone can be pushed into their limits by themselves.

You can grab any sin and screenshot it and you will see a masterpiece such as a painting because it is made to be perfect and it just nailed it."

10.0,2 April 2023,"From the moment I started watching Breaking Bad, I knew I was in for something special. This groundbreaking TV series captivated me from the very first episode, taking me on an emotional rollercoaster ride through the dark and twisted world of Walter White and his transformation from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin.

As a viewer, I was consistently amazed by the depth and complexity of the characters, as well as the phenomenal performances of the entire cast. Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary, and Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman, his troubled former student and reluctant partner in crime, is equally as impressive. The chemistry between the two actors is undeniable and provides the backbone of the show's emotional core.

Throughout my time with Breaking Bad, I found myself constantly on the edge of my seat, gripped by the series' masterful storytelling and expertly crafted suspense. The intricate plotlines and unexpected twists and turns kept me guessing and fully engaged from one episode to the next. Moreover, the stunning cinematography and memorable soundtrack served to further immerse me in the show's intense atmosphere.

One of the most striking aspects of Breaking Bad is its ability to delve deep into the human psyche, exploring themes of morality, ambition, and the consequences of our choices. I found myself questioning my own moral compass as I sympathized with, and even rooted for, characters who engaged in morally reprehensible actions. This thought-provoking aspect of the series is a testament to its powerful storytelling and the skill of its creators."
9.0,24 November 2023,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece! Recommend it? Absolutely! Imagine a mild-mannered chemistry teacher, Walter White, turned methamphetamine kingpin. Bryan Cranston's performance is mind-blowing, and Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is simply top-notch. The plot twists are jaw-dropping, leaving you on the edge of your seat. The character dynamics are intense, and the cinematography is a visual feast. It's an emotional rollercoaster, from nail-biting tension to heart-wrenching moments. If you haven't watched it yet, brace yourself for a wild marathon. The show's impact is undeniable, and you'll find yourself hooked from the first episode. Trust me, you won't regret it, buddy!"

9.0,9 January 2021,"I've watched so many shows nothing beats this one, it's The Best. I miss Breaking Bad"
10.0,16 April 2021,"This show is really unlike other shows. Sounds clichéd, I know, but it's true. Everything about this show is great. Maybe the first season is a tad un-eventful, but that's because it's setup. And the payoff is worth it, especially the last 3 episodes."
10.0,22 September 2016,"Well this is my first review on IMDb and I thought of doing this for the first time,purely because of how classy the show was throughout.The show had twists and turns,so that till the very last episode you have no idea about the outcome of the story.Walter White stars as a pitiful cancer patient and turns out to be perhaps,the worst criminal on TV(someone everyone would want to see the back of).Every episode offers something more exciting than the previous.Breaking Bad should be what defines TV in the 21st century without a doubt.Brilliantly written,equally very well acted and hats off for that man Vince Gilligan for exploring one of the most disgusting business in a way that anyone of all ages could enjoy"

1.0,26 November 2015,"I was skeptical at first as I don't typically go in for what others consider ""all the rage"" of the moment. But since I enjoy shows like The Sopranos, The Wire, etc. I thought I would give it a whirl. Right from the beginning I was hooked. Great characters, fantastic acting, and top notch writing all combine for an amazing series from beginning to end. It's not all 100% perfect but somehow that is even better than if it were perfect. Sort of like looking at an air-brushed photo of a supermodel...it just ain't real. This series, my friends shows what television can accomplish through great story-telling and edge-of-your-seat presentation. I will be following the careers of those who are behind the making of this fine series with great interest."

10.0,15 November 2020,"After starting reasonably slow, this legendary show quickly becomes outstanding and just gets better and better. Superb plot, awesome characters, great writing, amazing scenes, and several all-time great episodes."
10.0,7 May 2020,"So it took me years (yes I know, I know), but I have now completed at 62 episodes of this awesome show. I know that I am the last person on the planet to watch this, but if for some reason, you haven't seen it, or if you are bored, nothing on TV. Get this onto a TV set near you. So back to the start and a quick walk through of the concept. So in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), a normal standard high school chemistry teacher, has just celebrated his 50th Birthday. Generally this is a joyous and happy time, but mixed in with this, Walt, gets the awful news that he has terminal Cancer days after. His wife Skyler (played by Anna Gunn) is also pregnant with their second child, their first child is Walter White Jr. (played by RJ Mitte) who is a handicapped teenager. This news rocks the family. Walt is lives a normal (boring) life compare to Brother-In-Law Hank Schrader (played by Dean Norris), who is a D.E.A. agent and married to Skyler's sister Marie Schrader (played by Betsy Brandt). Hank invites Walt to come on a sting with him. The sting is a Crystal Meth Lab, while sitting in the car watching the D.E.A. do their jobs, Walt spots someone coming out of the next door neighbours window. This is local Crystal Meth dealer Jesse Pickmann (played by Aaron Paul), a former student of Walt's. Walt keeps this information from Hank and chooses to go to Jesse's house to discuss the possibilities of using his ""skills"" as a ""chemist"" to go into business with Jesse to make money for his family, for after his death, as they are not very well off. The story then continues. You will see ups, downs, further downs, even further downs, a few ups, a lot more downs and a few ups. You will see exactly what i mean. You will hate characters, then love them, the be happy for them, then sorry for them. That is a whole host of characters, not just 1 or 2.

Excellent Cast, Story-line, Script, Director, so on and so forth Have i told you yet that you should watch this! sure i have somewhere! if you have watched then watch again! it is seriously that good. It has an average of 9.5 on IMDb, which is an amazingly high score. I think that is too low! I have given this a 10!"
10.0,3 June 2019,"It's the goat. The show is perfect! Great acting, character development, and story arcs! Must see"
10.0,15 November 2021,"The show starts off with a relatable, simple premise. Walter White, a middle aged, underachieving high school chemistry teacher is diagnosed with inoperable terminal lung cancer. Having only a few months left to live, he decides to join the dangerous business of producing methamphetamine with his former student so he can make enough money to support his wife and two children after his death. That is the elevator pitch of the show. By the end of episode one, the episode feeds you this easily digestible plot setup and shows you firsthand the danger that Walter will experience throughout the show by having him use his knowledge of chemistry to create an explosion and outwit two rival meth dealers who are not welcoming of his new market competition. The show is consistently excellent at putting abrupt, explosive moments like this throughout the show to keep the audience hooked.

The show balances bombastic moments like this with slow, methodical character development that runs deep through the entire series. Basic character archetypes that exist to establish a quick connection with the audience like Skyler White, Walter's caring, concerned, stay-at-home wife and Jesse Pinkman, the high school dropout turned amateur drug dealer, are continually tested and pushed to tragic extremes and propelling their characters into entire new entities. Even the first season itself tonally is a great introduction, with the show coming off as more of a dark comedy than how it evolves to become in the later seasons. The light-heartedness of that makes it much more easy to get into. The journey taken by Walter White, in both a literal and character sense, is an experience that I have not seen evenly paralleled in any other story. Breaking Bad is a show that has something for everyone, whether you are someone who likes in-your-face action or a slow-paced story molded by shifting, interesting character motivations."
10.0,30 April 2020,The show is so good that I want to go back in time and rewatch it again. The characters were so neatly developed along the show. One of the very shows which gets better with time. Kudos to the writers and directors for making this masterpiece.
10.0,22 November 2019,"One of the very rare shows that remained consistent till the end. Breaking Bad, GOT and TWD started between 2009-2010. All of them are the biggest shows ever. GOT and TWD became worse towards the end. GOT ruined the entire final season with the worst ending. TWD became worse in S7 and it isn't like what it was before. Only Breaking Bad remained consistent till the end. That's why it is the best show ever created."
10.0,8 October 2019,One of the best Tv show ever made. It gets slow in season 2 and 3 and but 4 and 5 are well written. Small details were kept in mind while writing. Background songs in few scenes were nice to enjoy the events. Jesse and Walt will be part of your brain forever.
1.0,3 March 2020,It has the best ending. So nice to watch this series. I am very thankful to actors for making this series more wonderful. Acting was excellent no disappointment. They ended this series very beautifully.

10.0,26 September 2019,"Vince Gilligan is a mastermind! He didn't only created the greatest show of all the time but he also created an era which will be remembered forever. And yes, the amazing performance by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and also by rest of the cast, will not let you leave your seat... This show started with a BANG and ended with the BANG too... Unlike many great shows which fails to end in a better way, this one would never disappoint you. Undoubtedly this is the greatest show of all time"
10.0,9 April 2020,Only watch this show if you are ready to get sucked in. This show is one of the best cinematographic shows ever made. The visuals are on another level. The content and story writing keeps you guessing and EVERY DETAIL MATTERS. You could rewatch this show over and over and you would see so many hints that are dropped throughout the TV series. Amazing!
10.0,19 April 2023,"Final two seasons of Breaking Bad is nothing less than Perfection on screen. The Iconic Walter White's journey from a meek, good natured School Teacher to a frightening genius Druglord is complete and what a Ride it has been. Almost every episode is perfectly executed with top notch dialogues and unexpected twists that emotionally wreck you. Walter's war with Gus Fring keeps you clenched with dread and anticipation, and his descent to evil is a riveting watch. Each character's arc gets a satisfying closure and every loose end is tied perfectly in the final episode. One of the Greatest TV shows with the most satisfying Ending ever. Nothing else needs to be said..."
10.0,15 April 2021,"Nothing is comparable. Nothing can be judged. Nothing is near.

10.0,2 May 2020,Beyond the slow screenplay the series is bomb yo... Potrays a common chemistry teacher turning out into a dark villain.. Breaking y
10.0,30 August 2024,"I'm obviously not in the target demographic of the show. I do love Brian Cranston's body of work, and honestly... the cast is excellent across the board, but I never found the actual characters engaging, the plot interesting, or ever really enough to capture my attention beyond season one. I tried to stay interested. Man did I try, but the show was strained and mostly just plain boring - I found ""Better Call Saul"" infinitely more interesting if I'm being honest.

When it comes to fantastic TV crime dramas with unforgettable characters, this one sits well behind greats like ""Hannibal"", ""The Wire"", ""Mindunter"", ""Luther"", etc.

Honestly, I just don't get why this TV show is so well regarded. So, I can only assume I'm not in the crowd this show was meant for."

10.0,14 May 2020,"Everything about this show is perfect. The cast, the acting, the plot, EVERYTHING! I'm still not recovered from Season 5. It was an absolute masterpiece.

Thank you, Walter White and Jesse Pinkman for being the best duo in the history of TV.

You'll never watch a show that will be the same as this masterpiece. Never."
10.0,7 September 2022,"The most integrated series in terms of story, acting and writing. It cannot be denied that it is the best series ever launched Intelligence found in writing that makes it, without exaggeration, sit on the throne of series.

This series is a standard by which it is measured, and it must be studied in media institutes. For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant Although there are few characters in the series, it is rich in dialogues."

10.0,10 May 2021,
10.0,7 December 2020,"Containing in my opinion the best good to evil storyline of all time and thus this 5 season drama is extremely close to perfection. Season 1 is a very strong opening season with some great moment and fantastic writing. Season 2 is my least favourite season due to my disliking of the main plot lines of this storyline however it is still fantastic and introduces the majority of the best characters. Season 3 is IMO where the show becomes great in terms of characters, writing and entertainment value. The Salamanca twins and Gus really show what the drug world is like. Season 4 is my 2nd favourite season of tv of all time. Gus and Jesse become my 2 favourite characters in this season and the last 4 episodes is my favourite 4 episode stretch of tv ever. Season 5 holds up to the hype. I don't think it's as good as season 4 but it is a fantastic 2 part season with what some may say a perfect finale Any way even though breaking bad isn't my favourite show ever it is one of the greatest shows ever made."
10.0,29 April 2022,"I'm glad I gave this show a shot, even though I was sceptical about its quality. Breaking bad is a classic, well-written drama/crime show by Vince Gilligan, featuring Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. It's packed with twists, manipulation, humour, ethically questionable moments and pace changes, all while exponentially getting better.

For a show made in 2007, cinematography is beautiful (most memorable are time-lapses), while using colours as visual storytelling.

The show also uses camera positions to add the symbolism and make scenes much more powerful.

Acting of the entire cast is flawless. The only downside of the show is the overexaggeration of the science, which I don't mind, since it creates dramatisation and keeps the story consistent.

And with the new prequel, (a perfection) Better Call Saul, it's making a perfect loop.

10/10."
10.0,13 July 2023,"Breaking Bad is undoubtedly one of the most impressive television series ever created. My unwavering fascination with this show is simply incredible. From start to finish, Breaking Bad delivers a stunning blend of masterful acting, compelling character development, and irresistible suspense.

The actors in this series undoubtedly deliver exceptional performances. Bryan Cranston embodies Walter White in such an impressive way that one forgets he is just a character. His transformation from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord is nothing short of brilliant. Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, complements this portrayal with an emotional depth that truly captivates. The entire cast is endowed with such outstanding talent that one feels connected to the characters in every scene.

When it comes to character development, Breaking Bad is simply unmatched. Each character is carefully developed and given enough room to evolve. Whether it's the fragile yet resilient Skyler (played by Anna Gunn) or the psychopathic yet mesmerizing Gustavo Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito), they all undergo profound transformations. This development creates an emotional bond with the audience and lends the series a remarkable authenticity.

The suspense generated by Breaking Bad is simply breathtaking. Every episode is like a masterfully constructed thriller that keeps you glued to the screen. The high-intensity atmosphere created by the unpredictable twists and turning points will leave you breathless. You can never be sure what will happen next, and that's precisely what makes the series so gripping.

Breaking Bad is a series that excels in every aspect. From the impressive acting performances to the deep character development and the gripping suspense, it offers an unforgettable experience. This show is a masterpiece that digs deep into the hearts of viewers and stays with them long after the credits roll."
1.0,21 December 2023,"This TV show is one of the greats! I was fully expecting the same old, predictable storyline that every show follows, but to my surprise, this show did not disappoint me, and I was completely blown away.

The casting for this show is nothing short of genius. Every character has been cast perfectly, and I mean absolutely perfectly. It is similar to the casting in Pulp Fiction, where Travolta, Thurman, Samuel L Jackson, and Harvey Keitel were cast brilliantly.

Once you start watching the show, you are transported to a whole new world that you have never seen before. You keep waiting for it to become mundane and predictable, but with each season, the show just gets better and better, and it never disappoints.

The acting in this show is phenomenal. Every single actor has done an excellent job, and the subtexts, themes, and profundity are all there, but not everyone will see them. Can I call it a masterpiece? Yes, but it is beyond that. If there is a term for something beyond a masterpiece, then this show is it."
10.0,6 May 2023,"This is the perfect marriage of dark comedy, crime and drama that the modern day television so sorely needed. The show tells of Walter White, a science teacher with some bad news for his health, being diagnosed with a terminal illness. But he's got good intentions, including wanting to provide for his family and leave a legacy. So what does he do? He starts producing hard street drugs and becoming a household name amongst drug dealers everywhere.

It's one of the best antihero series that I've seen and the performances and writing are nothing short of incredible. If you haven't seen this, please do watch!"
10.0,13 February 2021,Rewatching it rn because nothing compares to Breaking bad.
10.0,24 June 2019,I watched so many tv shows but this is the best by far everyone must watch it as soon as possible. I liked it so much that I watched it several times and did not get bored. Everything is perfectly thought.
10.0,9 September 2022,"I ate the whole thing.. 60some episodes.

With the worst and most ungifted dialogue you could imagine. And just as it takes a little off in the 4th season and beginning of the 5th. And final season, it gets so lame through most of the final season. As one of my friends put it.. The reason for 9,5 on imbd must be, that you can make al lot of other super interesting things with Breaking Bad running in the background. Cause you're not missing out on anything.

The whole series is a bad copy cat of Prison Break, with an unbearable wife to the main character almost making you turn of your tv... wife charater 'stolen' from Sopranos.

Almost from the beginng I was alert to register just one intelligent dialogue, or original something during the whole series. I really wanted it to happen so I could excuse myself for watching it all... But sorry... It was so bad.."

9.0,1 January 2019,"This show shows you the perfect writing, acting and filming. This show is just perfect, there is not even one thing wrong with this show. The ambiental of the hot city of Albuquerque(hope I got it right) is just lovely. I gave it the ""most flawless show ever"" award. But dont misunderstand it with the best show ever. The only show the beats Breaking Bad is The Sopranos, by far. But this show is really nice. It is a MUST watch."

10.0,8 December 2021,This show is simply what suburbanites think of the city. It's incredibly stupid and with the time frame of the series it makes no sense. Only suburbanites who think drug dealers are scary city folk from 80s movies will enjoy this pointless show. Also can Bryan Cranston only make that face. Why all the close ups if that all he can manage to do.
10.0,4 September 2023,"I Really Love This Show It's Amazing 👏🏼 watched so many times, and Felina was so sad, I was about to cry 😢 it has the best story and character development. Best show I've ever seen. Want to watch it over and over again. Best TV show of All Time, The acting and writing is so epic and it really worth watching. Every single episode from the beginning to the end is well written and totally worth it. One my best decisions was watching Breaking Bad, and it is good as everyone says, you just have to watch it if you didn't yet. I Will Miss Them 😢 But Better Call Saul is Goated too. You'll Love Them Both."

10.0,27 September 2022,"I watched Breaking Bad about a year ago now. However, this show has stayed with me for the past year and is still my favorite over any other TV show or movie in existence. The only complaint that anyone can have of this show would be the somewhat slow pacing during season 2. Though this is overshadowed by the perfect last two seasons, and a perfect finale to season 3. I enjoyed every moment of it from start to end and I would recommend it to everyone that enjoys shows/movies. Breaking Bad is seriously the greatest television show of all time.

Personal ratings of every season: Season 1: 9.3/10 Season 2: 9.2/10 Season 3: 9.6/10 Season 4: 9.9/10 Season 5: 10/10."
10.0,7 June 2020,I watched this twice and I want to re-watch it. Fantastic and incredible. One of the series that you have to watch before diying
4.0,17 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is a show that needs no introduction. It is the single highest rated TV show on this site and has undoubtedly become one of the most iconic TV shows of all time!

However, the show has definitely earned it's legendary reputation. I genuinely struggle to think of a single glaring flaw that the show has. It does everything so well!

I don't think it's much of a hottake to say that Breaking Bad's greatest strengths by far are it's characters and acting. I am not exaggerating when I say that Breaking Bad may have the most believable, captivating, and complex cast of characters ever commited to television.

Many have talked at length about the morality of Breaking Bad's characters. Whether they are good or evil, or if some of their reprehensible actions are justified. This, in my opinion, is the beauty of the characters. Because they have such believable motivations, and multi-layered personalities, everyone who watches Breaking Bad can come away with different thoughts on the characters. Some may see Walter White as a monstrous wolf in sheep's clothing who only cares about his own ego and nothing else, while others may see him as a good man deep down who did awful things for the sake of protecting those he loves.

Speaking of Walt, Bryan Cranston delivers what can only be described as the performance of a lifetime as the show's deeply flawed anti-hero Walter White. Cranston conveys so many tangible human emotions throughout his time on the show that it almost defies believe. In the same scene he can expertly portray feelings of anger, pride, despair, satisfaction, vengefulness, and many other emotions in a way that remains unparalleled in mainstream television.

However, as good as Cranston's performance is, it is far from the only good one. Every single actor in the gigantic ensemble cast delivers a throughly memorable performance in their own way. From Anna Gunn as Walt's increasingly distaught wife Skylar, to Dean Norris as his heroic but secretly insecure brother in law Hank, to Giancarlo Esposito as the cunning, cold, and deadly crime lord Gustavo Fring.

These stellar acting performances are also complimented by a brilliantly written and enthralling story. Some have described the story of Breaking Bad as being almost Shakespearean in nature, this is unquestionably true. The tragic hero, the ambiguous seperation of good and evil, the consequences of greed, and revenge (all hallmarks of a Shakespearean tragedy) are just some of the many complex themes and ideas present within the story of Breaking Bad.

Throughout the story, characters are often forced to make extremely challenging and morally ambiguous decisions that blur the lines between good and evil. Morover, the story contains many shocking twists and turns that will keep you firmly on the edge of your seat.

In terms of the art of filmaking Breaking Bad is also incredibly well made. The stunning Neo Western cinematography conveys the vast, lawless, and barren wastelands that the show takes place in. In addition, the show masterfully uses lighting, sound design, and camerawork to highten the suspense of the story.

Overall, if you haven't seen this show yet for any reason, WATCH IT! It just does everything right. From the modern yet distinctly timeless story, to the absolutely breathtaking acting performances, to the astonishingly well written characters. It is truly one of the most unforgettable, thrilling, and fascinating shows you will ever watch."
9.0,7 June 2020,Season 1: 8/10 Season 2: 8/10 Season 3: 8/10 Season 4: 9/10 Season 5: 9/10.
10.0,29 November 2017,"It is the best TV series i have seen by far. Actually ""the best"" is an understatement. Breaking Bad is the most greatest thing ever happened to me. It is just that this show has a power to force one to watch it again and again. I definitely recommend this masterpiece to everyone. You have got to watch this no matter what."
10.0,14 December 2020,"I don't get this show and I never did. I really tried to watch it several times but I just think the surroundings and general mood is too depressing. I liked the premise a lot, but it never lived up to my expectations at all. Everything is too boring and serious. I mistook this for being somewhat of a comedy a long time ago but I don't think that's the only reason. A 9.5 rating from this many reviewers is just mind boggling to me. I'm completely honest when I give it a 5. It's so weird.

I have nothing to say about the actors performances. Walter is just too grumpy and nasty for me to bear though. I watched three seasons before I gave up."
10.0,10 December 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a groundbreaking television series that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of modern storytelling. Created by Vince Gilligan, the show follows the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student Jesse Pinkman.

At its core, ""Breaking Bad"" is a character-driven narrative that explores the consequences of one man's descent into the criminal underworld. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of extraordinary. His nuanced performance captures the complexities of a character who evolves from a sympathetic and desperate man facing a terminal illness to a morally ambiguous and ruthless figure.

The relationship between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, played by Aaron Paul, is a central dynamic that adds emotional depth to the series. Their partnership, fraught with tension, loyalty, and betrayal, serves as the emotional anchor of the show. Paul's portrayal earned him widespread acclaim, and the chemistry between the two leads is a driving force behind the series' success.

""Breaking Bad"" distinguishes itself through its meticulous storytelling and character arcs. The narrative unfolds with precision, building tension and suspense with each episode. The show's exploration of morality, the consequences of choices, and the impact of the drug trade on individuals and society elevates it beyond a mere crime drama.

One of the show's notable strengths is its attention to detail, from scientific accuracy in the depiction of chemistry to symbolic visual storytelling. The use of color, cinematography, and symbolism contributes to the show's visual richness and enhances its storytelling impact.

The supporting cast, including standout performances from Dean Norris as Hank Schrader and Anna Gunn as Skyler White, further enriches the series. The ensemble cast collectively brings depth to the characters that populate the show's Albuquerque setting.

""Breaking Bad"" received widespread critical acclaim and amassed a dedicated fan base during its original run. Its impact on television storytelling is evident in its numerous awards, including multiple Primetime Emmy Awards. The series is often cited as one of the greatest television dramas of all time.

In conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and thematic exploration. Its legacy extends beyond its initial broadcast, influencing subsequent television narratives and setting a high bar for quality and innovation. Whether you're drawn to its intense character studies, moral complexities, or gripping plot twists, ""Breaking Bad"" remains a must-watch for enthusiasts of compelling and thought-provoking television."
10.0,5 May 2020,"It took me several minutes just to think of a headline without being unfair .. just could not

Just AMAZING !"
10.0,3 August 2021,"I've watched this show 6 times and I have never got bored of it. The reason I think nothing will come close to this show is all down to the acting throughout the 5 seasons. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jessie are genuinely phenomenal all the way through the shows run time. A special mention to Dean Norris who plays Hank who is personally my favourite character in the whole show. The writing from season to season seems to get better and better in fact I believe there isn't a bad episode, the infamous ""Fly"" episode has a lot more to it that catches the eye. The show also has the greatest single piece of television I've ever seen in the episode titled ""Ozymandias"" which is linked to a poem about the rise and fall of someone in power which is also the greatest title for this 45 minute thrill ride of an episode. The show might have taken a lot of inspiration from The Sopranos but I feel as if Breaking Bad has a much more of a compelling and flowing story. Vince Gilligan take a bow for creating a masterpiece that will likely never be beaten. My ""Baby Blue""."

Its funny that this show could only work in America as the main charcter of Walter White wouldnt need to sell meth to pay for his cancer treatment.

Its well written, filmed and acted in every episode. I first saw this show half way through and episode on tv randomly and even then I was hooked and had to find more.

Theres something real about it, its the doom and gloom of real life.

Once the show is ofer you then have another treat with its spin of show.

I May need to give it rewatch of christmas as I need a refresh and catch up on my fav show."
10.0,25 June 2023,"How would this trash get 9.5 on this site? Super boring and without thrill. No emotions, no scary parts, and no one is interested in this. Really stupid stuff in there, and it's super stupid too. Bored me to death and I slept through. Ridiculous show gets high rankings when it's actually boring. No one is like able, nothing is gripping, nothing is good here and the use of colour is intolerance. Ridiculous show with boring, bland characters. And the rating s are brilliant, for this heap of trash? They should go and rewatch it and rethink of themselves. If they did, the rating would lower to 5 or 4. Couldn't finish an episode. Unwatchable."
10.0,9 July 2019,"One of the greatest TV shows ever made. After completing Game of Thrones, i was asking myself ""WHAT'S NEXT ""?, After some suggestions, i started watching Breaking Bad. First couple of episodes were boring hell, but after that story takes pace. It is unstoppable when you're into it. As my profession is also teaching, i was totally moved by the role Walter White. A great father, A great teacher and a Great Meth Cook. Unlike GoT, Breaking bad had its all loose ends sorted out perfectly. The ending of breaking bad is just EPIC.

now Breaking Bad is over for me, WHAT'S NEXT??? THE WIRE????"

10.0,8 November 2016,"This is the best show I've ever seen and not at all on a subject I thought I'd have a remote interest in. The characters are perfectly flawed, the story telling is smart, the pacing excellent and the wrap-up in the final season is everything you could want. You find that you're breathing heavily as a major story arch is achieved, another wrinkle added to the layers of deception and more intrigue building between various characters (some related, some not) than you thought was possible. The show is such a spectacle, it ends up carrying itself easily and bringing you along for the ride. Better hang on, it's a roller-coaster! Bryan Cranston IS Walter White, aka-Heisenberg. SAY HIS NAME!!!"
10.0,7 May 2022,"I was addicted to this TV show its the best of all time.it has all elements to be the best TV show.

I recommend every one to watch it ."
10.0,26 December 2023,"Both of Gilligan's masterpieces 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul' have raised TV standards to the highest levels of storytelling, character building and creativity at large. Walter White, like Saul Goodman, isn't just another criminal. He is THE character, the unaccomplished chemistry teacher turned by need into THE ruthless druglord. Likewise, Saul Goodman enters the world of crime by necessity at first and greed as time goes by.

Vince Gilligan has created amazing and unpredictable stories that keep you hooked for over 100 episodes. The casting, acting and directing is phenomenal, too, and as realistic as it can get. Who could tell Albuquerque would ever be the setting for such amazing stories.?!"

But most of america felt like this was a great tv show... The acting was ok but all this over some little money I mean there are so many people out there living without you know a savings or a house living from paycheck to paycheck and we are supposed to sympathize with this idea that this cancer having chemistry proffessor wouldnt have the finances to support or sustain his family after he dies. What about the other 90 million americans who arent certified public accountants, professional medical doctors or working for the dupage county public defenders office/"

10.0,14 July 2019,This show is just great. It got pretty much everything right. The characters are great and so are the actors. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are just so wonderful like they were born to act together. All the other actors are amazing as well. Anna Gunn plays Skyler White so well you forget that she is acting. I developed feelings for all the characters and just wanted to know what's next for them. The story comes to end nicely and is quite satisfying in my opinion. I could go on but yeah you get the point. This show is a masterpiece. So if you haven't seen it just go and enjoy this great show.
10.0,4 November 2019,It's perfect from beginning until the end. A masterpiece!

10.0,5 October 2024,"Every good TV show has a sort of vibe or style or identity that just immerses you into the show and makes it feel realistic. They also tend to have depth in their characters and stories. Breaking bad has none of this, tries to be badass but everything that happens is so unrealistic its almost cartoonist. Walter has a bit of depth but its vastly overrated, Jesse has basically none. And the visuals are constantly yellow for some reason in Mexico, which even started a meme. So whenever there's supposed to be tension, all these factors combine and become so distracting I feel nothing. I would give a 4/10 if people didn't put this as the #1 and started fanboying on it and thinking its the best show that exists and will ever exist."

10.0,26 June 2022,"When first starting this show I wasn't sure what to expect I've only heard good things about this show from other people and that it was a tv I have to watch and after finishing the show they weren't wrong!

From the very beginning the show gets you hooked that you just want to stay and watch all of it! Each season is so amazing and I have never heard anyone say anything bad about them it's always been positive things!

The characters are the best part of this show from the main characters to the villains you will love them all!

Only thing that I can really say bad about this show is that the first season is a bit slow but other than that everything about it is so good! It really wants to make you binge watch it all in one day!"

10.0,4 March 2018,"La mejor serie del mundo, es perfecta. Felina es perfeccion pura"
10.0,13 June 2022,"I don't have that much experience but I can distinguish between a good show and a bad one and Breaking Bad is a masterpiece:

What can I say that hasn't been said already, it's a constant thrill of a series, evolving its plot and characters each season, perfecting its formula and being better each episode that goes on, a very rare thing nowadays.

As the general consensus about it says, the best thing about this show are its characters, more or less human, each important character has different circumstances and emotions so that you can almost empathize with all of them as you now their circumstances. Walt's joruney in evolving from a middle-aged man without dreams or life objectives to Heisenberg, a millionaire meth kingpin. Jesse, starting as what can be for some an annoying drug addict has, in my opinion, the best evolution out of all the other characters, including Walt, to being the one you will root for in the end. Other phenomenal characters would be Gus, Hank, Mike or Skyler, whom I think that is pretty underrated as a character.

I don't have much to say about the acting. Cinematography or sound design as there are some of the best scenes I've seen ever being the season endings or introductions some of the best ones and Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston delivering some of the best performances I've seen.

Overall, I can't stress enough how much I recommend this show."

10.0,28 May 2019,"TV shows gradually has a way dropping out of the story line or the direction as the show progresses, but breaking bad never went into that phase. It is best complete and perfect TV show that you will ever see from start to finish. Might feel like dragging at some time, but it's totally worth it."

10.0,8 February 2021,"I appreciate the cast for making this series. I've seen some shows before this, but it was what intruduced me the first, that a series can be as perfectly made as a movie. I have seen a lot of great shows that i enjoyed after Breaking Bad, but nothing was that perfect like this, and i think nothing will be."
10.0,19 May 2019,This TV Show is The Definition of Perfect Number 1
10.0,11 May 2024,
10.0,23 August 2019,"Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's portrayal of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman will go down in history as some of the best! My review is simply: this show is phenomenal and I highly recommend anyone to watch it, it is most certainly worth it!"
9.0,16 October 2020,"Breaking Bad was perfect from start to finish. From the acting to the amazing storytelling, it is one of the best shows to ever air on TV. It ended exactly when it should have and wasn't overdone. 10/10."

9.0,28 October 2019,Breaking bad is the show that I never forget in my whole life & I thik Bryan & Aaron done it by it's perfection & also entire cast is brilliant & As always miss u Mr White
10.0,5 October 2024,"Not sure what to say. Don't care about the premise - we all know there's no health system in the states and if you can't pay you die but I find it difficult to care about that. Secondly, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to care about the two main characters so much that I'd condone their illegal activities. Surely if one has to choose between accepting charity from someone or producing illegal drugs, then the choice is rather obvious? Lastly, there are some pathetic attempts of dark humour which I didn't find funny at all. It's not exactly Guy Richie, is it? If anyone thinks this show is original and clever, they must be on meth.

If you want an interesting series with deep multidimensional characters, a captivating plot line and unexpected twists, then watch Slow Horses - it has the finest British humour too."
10.0,5 November 2020,"Breaking Bad is a unique show, to say the least. The premise is one of a kind, the characters interesting and believable, the plot keeps you glued to the screen. Not every episode is action-packed, but every ""filler"" episode leads up to the action you crave. The story is seamless and well thought-out, the content intelligent and not doubtful. I never once had the temptation to fast-forward through any ""boring"" bits that so many other shows suffer from.

An example of the show's believable nature: instead of thinking a character like Skyler White is given bad dialogue by the writers or that there are plot holes in her behavior, you either hate her or sympathize with her plight. I personally hated her - I couldn't stand the way she treated Walt most of the time; if his secret was unknown to her, she should have been better to him, but at least in the first few seasons her behavior waxes and wanes between being a total b**** and just being a bad wife, with moments of decent nature mixed in. I'm currently watching the show for the Fourth time through, and I'd still like to give Skyler a piece of my mind.

I highly recommend watching the show, I will say though that this does have heavy, adult themes, not for younger or immature minds. The profanity is aplenty, drug use commonplace, and even a smidge of nudity mixed in. It somewhat glorifies yet simultaneously criticizes drug use and its distribution, but also gives a dose of the harsh reality of the street dealer life.

Hope you enjoy."
9.0,17 June 2022,"I think there will never be a show in the near future that is on this level. The wirting, the acting, the final, the screenplay just everything is perfect especially the last two seasons are the two best seasons in TV history. For me Breaking Bad will always be the best show. A Masterpiece."
10.0,23 June 2020,"My parents are freaking out. Seriously, watch this"
10.0,18 August 2021,"Breaking Bad is a television series that everyone should see, both to start in the world of television series and also if you already liked any tv series before. It is a series that is getting better every season. There are many series just as interesting as Breaking Bad, but I feel like Breaking Bad can be overall a perfect starting point."
10.0,16 December 2019,Amazing series! How characters change throughout is incredible!
10.0,20 August 2019,"Well to honest, I m feeling I m also a met-head, but not high due to meth.... I m high just because I saw myself ""Breaking Bad"" Would love to watch it at least 10 times more... Feel like I m living in this character.... Ohhh God"
10.0,2 March 2020,Breaking bad truly deserves the number 1 position in ratings.It leaves you awestruck. Once you have watched it you won't like any other tv series as much as you like breaking bad. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are fantastic. Vince Gilligan knows what the Audience wants. Vince Gilligan has done an excellent direction. Best TV series ever.

10.0,21 September 2017,"For me, Breaking Bad deserves to be named the best TV series ever. Like seriously, how does one get to shoot perfection such as this? I cried in some parts of the show because I just couldn't imagine what was going through the writer's head when the plot was written.

The show's intoxicating and for me, it's simply perfection."

10.0,24 August 2020,"Most people say the first 2 seasons are rather uneventful and tedious. However, this sets a perfect build towards the 3rd and 4th season which are the best seasons of any TV show ever created. The show is a masterpiece and should be watched by any true tv series enthusiast."

10.0,30 April 2020,"Since we (South Africa) are in lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, i watched this series for the 3rd time and enjoyed it even more, sitting thru the entire 5 seasons in one go...shed a tear listening to ''Baby Blue'' by Badfinger at the very end, one of my favourite songs and very appropriate."
10.0,1 June 2022,"2022 take note this is how you write a story, interesting characters with depth and purpose, no politics just compelling story telling with the most mind blowing finale I've ever seen. Hats off to the actors, actresses and production team."

10.0,27 August 2021,"Whilst struck down with Covid I watched a number of series. 'Chernobyl' (magnificent), Barry (enjoyable) and then tried my luck with 'Breaking Bad'.

I just managed the first 2 episodes. It is slow, but thats no problem. Found it very depressing and nihilistic. Acting is great, but whereas Chernobyl is not laughing matter either , Breaking Bad stretches the bad vibes to the max. I'll skip this one for sure."
10.0,23 September 2020,One of the best shows on television. Intelligently written and perfectly executed. Cast is incredible. Bryan Cranston is a hell of an actor.

10.0,16 October 2020,By far the best tv show. First season was a little bit of boring but thats because it trias to set the plot and tone. The rest is amazing. Especially the last season. O em gi. That last season is one of a kind.
10.0,7 June 2022,"Breaking bad is quite possibly the greatest show of all time. It is a series in which, if you give it your time you will be rewarded. The character development portrayed in Walter White throughout the series is unparalleled to any other show. It is a must watch and will be for many years to come."
9.0,22 January 2020,"I don't think there's anything else to say about this masterpiece of a TV show that hasn't been said. Awesome from first episode to last (except the boring, pretentious, and lame fly episode). Acting, incredible. Storyline, fantastic. Writing, amazing. Characters, deep and meaningful. The show remains with you long after watching."
10.0,11 November 2020,
10.0,22 October 2019,"I am unable to write anything that can tell you just how good this series is. I watched it in 2008, and I watched it again recently. Has anything come close? There have been other good series since. However, whatever comes next will have to exceptional to better this. Have fun. 😎"
10.0,6 July 2022,"Best Series ever! The series is a message from gods.. Every single detail is so important and so well directed. This can't be criticized by any one. The scene were Gus confronted Walter to leave immediately and the shade of sky turn dark that shows the nature also wanted a part in the show making the scene so significant. The bgm, the direction, the acting everything synchronised perfect."

10.0,14 December 2021,
10.0,20 October 2020,Best 👍
10.0,28 May 2022,"The writing, acting, cinematography, and showrunning of Breaking Bad leaves the majority of crime dramas wanting for more. I've met people that don't like this show, but without exception, these people haven't watched from start to finish. The plot is simple, a man is given an expiration date, and knowing he never lived up to his full potential, he puts his expertise to use in order to ensure his family can live comfortably. At least, that is, at first. Watching Walter White's descent in to the depths of darkness is fun, frightening, sometimes pedantic, and often heartbreaking. There are certainly speed bumps along the way in regards to the integrity of the plot (the fly episode, anyone?), but even bottle episodes contribute to the rich depth of the story and character development. The way this show concluded was, to me, simply flawless. I haven't found a show with a more concise and plausible ending than Breaking Bad. If you haven't given this show a chance, you're doing yourself a disservice."
10.0,7 March 2024,"Breaking Bad has unequivocally secured its place as my all-time favorite TV show, earning a flawless 10/10 rating in my book. Vince Gilligan's groundbreaking series skillfully combines intense character development, riveting storytelling, and exceptional cinematography.

Bryan Cranston's transformative performance as Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine kingpin, is nothing short of extraordinary, matched only by Aaron Paul's portrayal of the complex Jesse Pinkman. The show's meticulous attention to detail, morally gray characters, and unpredictable plot twists create an unparalleled viewing experience that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.

Breaking Bad is not just a TV show; it's a gripping journey into the dark complexities of human nature, leaving an indelible mark on the world of television."
10.0,1 February 2020,Best show in the whole universe thank you Vince Gilligan for making this masterpiece
10.0,21 October 2020,This the only TV show I would say I could watch over and over again and it never get old! I wish it never ended.

10.0,23 July 2020,"I'm rewatching it, this is crazy! Maybe this is the best tv show ever"
10.0,25 January 2018,"The writers created a tribute to high dostoevskian dark comic buffoonery, set in ABQ New Mexico...brilliant. The clarity of Walter's blue meth is the writers winking at you as if to say, do yourself a favor and re-read a few pages of Crime and Punishment while watching this one..."
10.0,26 October 2020,Too good Probably the best series ever Must watch series But breakfast parts are a little boring
9.0,4 June 2019,I love it so Much. And the Even nailed the ending.
10.0,29 December 2019,"Here goes for my first review, I imagine it would be fitting to make it for my favorite TV series of all time.

Breaking Bad is simply a trip -- for lack of a better word. Throughout this review I'm gonna speak on my personal feels regarding this series, leaving out most of the technical things, i.e. cinematography, acting performances, etc. I can sit here giving endless praise for all of that as I'm sure thousands of others have before me.

That said, I have watched this series -- front to back -- five times as of 2019. There's something captivating about the entirety of the story. Everyone on the team did an amazing job at creating what I believe to be the best TV show of all time.

I've left any mention of anything relating to spoilers out for one reason: If you haven't watched this series yet, WATCH IT. Go rent it from somewhere if you have to, go torren- err.. I don't think I'm allowed to finish that sentence. Just watch it by any means necessary -- I'm serious.

Perfect 10! I have no doubt this show is gonna be looked back on as a timeless classic, immortalized in history."

10.0,23 July 2020,"Walter white is a family loving, well-mannered, responsible high school chemistry teacher with a loving wife-Skyler and a disabled teenage son. His life alters drastically when diagnosed with a terminal lung cancer. In order to secure the family financially and to pay for his treatment, Walter decides to cook and sell methamphetamine using the help of his former student Jesse Pinkman.

With a profound knowledge for chemistry Walter manages to cook meth with an unmatched purity and instantly gains recognition for his 'blue meth'. Initially earning a few thousand dollars Walter gradually builds an empire worth $80million but the drug trade is never easy and Walter has to resort to gruesome murders, violence and deceit in order to save his empire and his family. Ironically Walter's brother in law is a DEA agent and Walter effectively manages to hide is true identity under the name 'Heisenberg' which turns into the most dreaded name amongst the drug lords.

Walter and Jesse undergo massive character transformation. From this simple non-violent guy, Walter transforms' into a greedy and a dangerous criminal which eventually leads to his family abandoning him. Aaron Paul is deep into the character of Jesse Pinkman and will make you fall in love with him. It will break your heart to see Jesse always at the receiving end of injustice. The show constantly resonates between high and low moments. Probably the best fiction show I have ever seen so far."
10.0,22 October 2020,"First 3 seasons were amazing but 4-5 seasons made this series the best. The character build up was great, story was great, every detail was well thought. No complaint* ending was what it should have been. Everything thing in this show was perfect."

10.0,3 February 2021,"I have never felt the urge to write a review I have watched Breaking Bad too many times to mention. If you have never watched it please do. It is perfection in a TV series in every way. The cast, the locations, the script, the acting is 10/10. I speak to a few people and they say it's a bit of a slow burner ? I ask them to go back and rewatch again. Thank god they do. I cannot praise this series enough and all the awards it won were thoroughly deserved. Fantastic TV. Thanks for making it."
10.0,10 September 2019,"Trust me this is the best TV show that ever existed and its ending is surely satisfied by any viewer.

10.0,24 January 2019,"I could write a thousand words to express how perfect this series is and it would never be enough. I can't believe I'm done with it and I'm writing these words with wet eyes. I laughed, I grieved, I celebrated, I panicked, I clapped, I sighed, I shouted, I whispered and God, I never felt attached to anything as I did with Breaking Bad; The details, the characters, the performance, the quotes, the dispersed dots and the feelings of satisfaction and thriller I felt while connecting them together. I'll miss everything about it. There wasn't, isn't, and won't be another show as this, never!"

10.0,25 October 2020,"This is the best show you'll ever watch in your entire life. It keeps getting better and better each episode. The ending is a masterpiece, well, the whole show is a masterpiece. Really, if you haven't watch it, I don't know what are you waiting for."
10.0,27 August 2024,"This film is a masterful exploration of moral decay, following the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord. The show is brilliantly crafted, with meticulous attention to detail and a narrative that builds tension to almost unbearable levels. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter is nothing short of iconic, as he brings depth and nuance to a character who is both terrifying and tragic. The supporting cast, especially Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, adds layers of complexity and emotional weight to the story. ""Breaking Bad"" is a slow burn, but it rewards patience with some of the most memorable moments in television history. It's a gripping tale of ambition, power, and the consequences of choices that resonate long after the final episode."
10.0,26 August 2019,"I've never written a review, but HAD to say something about this 10/10 series. I'm 65 years old and hearing about a show about making & trafficking in Crystal Meth was certainly not something I was going to condone or watch...even if it DID get all 10-star ratings, damnit!! ...until I was challenged to just watch the first episode.

Bam! I was blown away by the opening scene and couldn't believe I was hooked so fast. This series is drama/comedy/suspense all in one. With superb writing like this (in every single episode), it will be very difficult to be surpassed in its entirety. Then, you have a cast of characters so perfectly chosen that you become truly invested in their lives...all the good and bad.

Best series I've ever seen and will probably ever see. I've waited long enough now to watch it all over again; which I'm starting today. And CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW MOVIE! People think the producers shouldn't mess with it, but I totally trust them because they sure as hell wouldn't do anything to taint their masterpiece series!"
10.0,20 July 2020,"Best tv show ever made , flawless story line. OMG!"
10.0,14 March 2019,"This is a must watch for everyone. The story,the location,the screenplay,the cast everything was perfect. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were excellent playing Walter White and Jesse Pinkman. Apart from them,Saul Goodman was my favorite character. Gustavo Fring was also an entertaining character. Character development was excellent. You can't root for a single character throughout the series. It kept me engaged till the finale. There is nothing to complain about. It won't disappoint you. It's got the thrill,the drama and sarcasm. Trust me,it's worth the hype. It's a gem. The show itself could be methamphetamine."
10.0,12 May 2024,"This was the first ""real"" series i've ever watched. Before Breaking Bad i had only watched a couple of sitcoms but none with a serious plot-line that moves between the episodes. I heard it was good so i decided to give it a shot. From episode one, i was hooked. Even now, although i don't rememeber my reactions, i do remember not being able to stop watching. Since this one i've seen a couple of other ""drama type"" series, and although some of them have almost reached the heights of this one, for me, none of them have managed to surpass it.

This series follows a chemistry teacher (Walter White), who is diagnosed with lung cancer trying to provide for his family by making drugs with his former student (Jesse Pinkman). That concept alone sounds very simple, but it's also VERY brilliant.

From the very wonderful set of unique characters, and their amazing acting, to the gripping plot, this show is a must-watch even today!

10/10."
9.0,25 July 2022,"I was always turned off from Breaking Bad by its pilot. Not to say it's bad, actually quite the opposite. It does such a good job portraying Walt's feelings about his life that it's downright impressive, albeit anxiety-inducing and depressing. Despite this, I'm very happy I gave the show a real shot because it's pretty great.

The protagonists pull you in instantly. Walt's character is unlikeable in some ways and a badass in others. Jesse is hilarious and the best character in Season 1. For just being a young stoner at first glance, he is hilarious and oddly charming. You can't help but always feel and root for him.

The relationship between these two and how, by chance, their lives become entangled together long after Jesse's school days is something to behold. I love the dynamic that Jesse isn't as bad as he looks while Walt is way less innocent than one may assume at first glance.

For supporting characters, Walt Jr. And Hank are both hilarious editions. Meanwhile, Skyler and Marie are super annoying, but seemingly intentionally so.

The show is jam-packed with action. We are shown how boring Walt's life was, but also how dangerous the life he's gotten himself into is. You can tell Walt and Jesse are gonna need each other since neither is fully prepared for this world with their individual skill sets.

And the situations they get themselves into are over-the-top insanity in all the right ways. Because of this, and the oddly ordinary yet colorful characters, the show is both serious and hilarious.

My few nitpicks would be how often they would jump forward between episodes, and how the season feels cut short. Tuco is a wild and scary villain from the get-go. Perhaps the season should've gone to avoid 2x02 to avoid the weird cliffhanger with him.

In reality, Season 1 doesn't have the biggest plot, but it's a great start to something special. It immediately challenges you with moral dilemmas (a season highlight being the Emilio storyline) and is complemented by awesome music and directing."
10.0,25 July 2022,Great show. Will definetly keep you interested. One of my favorites. A show you can rewatch. Hard to have just one favorite character. You will be hooked after just o episode.
10.0,1 January 2020,"The character of Walter White is you, me, and every human being that surrenders to his desires and himself, while Hank is the spiritual resistance against the desires of the body and the love of money, it is an indescribable series in the beauty of written characters and the magnificence of performance from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, when I finished watching the series, a set of ideas came to my mind, which are elegant

1) The truth whatever you hide it will be revealed, even after a while 2) Lying, fraud and murder are devastating things even if they did for good reasons, the end does not justify the means 3) Hank, Skyler and Jesse Pinkmin are the characters that resisted Walter"" Hiesenberg"" and triumphed over them in goodness and this gives us a lesson that we do not despair and that we can resist evil because we will triumph and this will became in their lives and lives of the viewers a point of salvation 4) To admit that you are bankrupted and in urge need of money is exactly similar to as if you admit that you are wrong and in need of a forgiveness, escaping from that fact and covering it up behind the fake pride destroyed Walter and it may also destroy us if we follow him !!

Legendary series 100/100"
10.0,6 April 2020,"I started watching this series by the Recommendation of a friend and now I have recommended it to all my known person.

Applause to the whole team behind ""Breaking Bad"" because I know a lot of people were involved in creating this masterpiece. Vince Gilligan is the god producer of this generation, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul were absolutely phenomenal. I didn't expect this kind of ""chemistry"" between these two actors. Every single season grows on you, just like you're having a nice aged scotch whiskey, you want to watch more and more."
10.0,27 May 2019,"Greatest Tv Show I have ever seen.

Thanks for being the greatest characters in the world."
10.0,9 September 2024,"*Breaking Bad* is one of the greatest TV series ever made, following the transformation of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin. The show excels with a tightly woven plot, exploring complex themes like morality, power, and greed. Bryan Cranston delivers a masterful performance as Walter, alongside Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, both of whom bring depth to their characters. The cinematography is stunning, with creative camera work and memorable New Mexico landscapes.

Its lasting legacy, brilliant writing, and intense character development make *Breaking Bad* a near-perfect series, deserving of a 9/10 rating."
10.0,18 April 2020,"Watching the show before finding out that it won so many awards helped as it leads to a perception being created. Better to watch it without so much of expectations. But after having watched it, I can say it deserves all the praise!!! My god I love every character's development. The makers really knew where they were taking. The cast was perfect for their respective roles. Just amazing performances, like they were meant to do their roles. Keeping it all spoiler free :) P.s- this is the first thing I have done after creating IMDB account, total fan."
10.0,3 September 2019,"Just finished the series. Wow. It left me broken knowing that I will never watch something so well made again. Everything about Breaking Bad is flawless. People and Studios should learn from Breaking Bad. The greatest series of the 2010s by far. Never have I ever cried about TV Series characters , but this series did. So well written. Every character is fleshed out to the bone. So, thank you Vince Gilligan. Thank you for caring enough that we poured your soul into this and made it an absolute blast. Thank you for inspiring me and thank you for these beautiful memories."
10.0,11 November 2020,I've seen many movies in different genre but before watching this show I hadn't seen a TV series . after that; I've become much interested in TV series and I'm watchin other shows these days but no one is as beautiful and as Breaking Bad...! this series is really exciting and it has many breathtaking scenes. so highly recommended :)
10.0,12 October 2024,"A cult-classic, and for a reason. This show delivers on absolutely every facet, with its small quirks and flaws being but particles of dust on a shiny three-piece wedding suit.

The main character is an in-depth and believable character, which due to incredible acting and writing, manages to take you on a transformative 5-season ride, allowing you to both love and loathe what Walter White ultimately becomes.

Its supporting characters are treated with as much care in craft, and especially Jessie Pinkman stands out as a beautifully tragic being with an arc and story in of itself.

The dialogue is grounded yet packed in detail and foreshadowing. The chemical symbolism throughout the show thematically enhances the work to greater depth.

The antagonist elegantly walk the grey area of being both archetypical, gimmicky, and granted stories of their own.

The wider commentary on The War on Drugs is both subtly and overtly interwoven in the story and the show goes a long way in dissecting the many facets of a drug and crime ridden society.

The story is well-structured and contains a set-up, mid-point and neat conclusion that demonstrates the director's calculated planning and smooth execution.

It, at times, suffers from gimmicky moments and less-than-believable scenarios but these things are quickly forgotten when looking at the broad (masterpiece of a) picture."
10.0,17 December 2019,You've got to watch it! 1st season drags on a bit but once you're into it you're hooked! Recommend to everyone
10.0,25 October 2019,The best show in television history period.............
10.0,31 May 2024,"The writing in ""Breaking Bad"" is top-notch. Vince Gilligan and his team crafted a story that balances intense drama with moments of dark humor. The dialogue is sharp, and the plot twists are both surprising and inevitable, reflecting the show's meticulous planning. Each episode builds upon the last, creating a cohesive and compelling narrative.

The direction and cinematography are equally impressive. The use of Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the primary setting provides a stark and often haunting backdrop for the story. The show's visual style, from its inventive camera angles to its bold color palettes, enhances the storytelling and creates an immersive viewing experience.

""Breaking Bad"" delves into themes of morality, family, identity, and the consequences of one's choices. It raises questions about the nature of good and evil, and the lengths one will go to protect loved ones. The show's exploration of these themes is thought-provoking and leaves a lasting impact on its audience.

The series also had a significant cultural impact, influencing numerous other shows and leaving a legacy that continues to be felt in television today.

""Breaking Bad"" is a masterpiece that stands as a high watermark in television history. Its compelling characters, intricate plot, and thematic depth make it a must-watch for any fan of quality storytelling.

10.0,20 January 2020,"If you've never watched the entire series of Breaking Bad..... I envy you. There's never been a TV show or even movie that has captivated me like BB. I wish I could go back in time and watch for the 1st time again. Breaking Bad is.... hands down, without question....the best TV show ever. I'll go even further: BB is THE BEST story ever told with a live action camera. Yes!..... it's that damn good. If you haven't watch BB yet (not sure how that's even possible with how epic it is), do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the best story ever put on a screen"
10.0,21 September 2019,Best series in the world. Amazing in all the ways.

10.0,25 May 2019,"I watched Breaking Bad in 2014. When Im watching, sometimes I was bored because Walter's changing is goes slowly but good and detailed. This TV series with action, drama, camera and casts deserving 10 point"
10.0,26 May 2019,"This show is just so amazing. People who rate it bad are clearly not getting the depth of this show. I literally binged this show one episode after the other with my boyfriend the past week and it's got me seriously hooked. It's so funny and yet sad at the same time, and those two elements are hard to write well but the writers did a phenomenal job with it. The aspect of character arcs is amazing in the show. Every character changes, goes through hard times and difficult choices.

One of my personal favorite things about this show besides the writing is how funny it is. I die at the parts where Jesse insults Walt (he's this old man getting insulted by a younger dude it's too funny) and where characters have silly interactions. I really felt for Walt in this show.

Also, cast couldn't have been better chosen. Everyone fits their roles so well its uncanny. You have to watch this show!"
10.0,26 October 2020,It's the most perfect season i have ever watched. The small details in different episodes is perfect. I would totally recommend Breaking Bad

10.0,9 November 2019,"One of the best TV shows of all time. Not a single episode was even the slightest bit boring, and they were all very important. First season was very good, the rest was absolutely incredible. The acting is impressive. Standout performance from Aaron Paul. Show is very dark and gritty. Very great performance from Bryan Cranston. His performance really makes you feel for his character. Lots of suspense throughout the series. Keeps you on the edge the entire time. Final episode concludes the show in a very good way. No plot holes, no mistakes made. Ends in a perfect way. Great show, one of the best shows of all time. Watched the whole series in less than a month."
10.0,20 October 2020,"I love it so much! Great story, characters, details, everything!"
10.0,5 August 2019,This is by far my favorite television show ever. Gets you hooked and can't stop watching it. Literally when I finished the last episode I cried and had to start over because I literally missed the cast. Such great acting and storyline is top notch.
9.0,22 May 2019,"I started watching these TV Series very reserved. I don't like generally movies/stories about drugs, drug dealers etc. I just started it because I've heard from friends of mine that it is amazing show. I saw the rating here in IMDB. And oh, well, I decided to give it a try. That was one of my best decisions I've ever made! This show touched me so deeply! This TV Show really changed my mind forever. Some of the lines of the characters were very therapeutic for my emotional problems. This is a cinematic masterpiece I will rewatch many times!"
9.0,9 November 2020,"Honestly, I'm not sure where to start in reviewing this brilliant series. This show has the best chemistry between two main leads. It has the most fleshed out characters and has the most amazing arcs, including supporting roles that never went to waste and villains that aren't silly, but will actually scare you. Top-notch acting by everyone and my god the writing by Vince Gilligan.

Watching this is not chill, it will continuously throw things at your face, which is great because how you're feeling will match how the characters at the moment are feeling, you know just constantly anxious, therefore much relatable. If you're like me who has acrophobia and won't go to places with such great heights, then this show is perfect because it is like a roller coaster.

This show is just a different animal, a different caliber and the best TV series I've ever watched, which is a thriller genre BTW and this is coming from a hardcore horror fan (me) so that's saying something.

I'll fight anyone who says this show is not good. I highly recommend it, watch it and be blown away by ""Science, b***h!"" (you'd get this catchphrase once you start watching it )"
8.0,12 October 2019,"So, for the past 2-3 years a series I've fell in love with and dedicated watching, has been Breaking Bad due to word of mouth recommendations. The whole series was out-gloriously-standing and Vince Gilligan added a great deal of twists and turns within the story over 5 seasons to keep me gripped in the storyline. The ensemble casting has added to the depth of the story combined with amazing effects, videography, photography and in turn amazing characters etc. All of which making this series a master piece to watch and very, very pleasing to watch exploiting an unexplored market which undoubtedly contributed to this success. Lastly, watching the 5x16 finale just there, has meant that I can leap into El Camino and follow the story further, with confident eyes/ a clean mind and just enjoy what happens more."
10.0,23 July 2020,"Walt White (Bryan Cranston) is a high school chemistry teacher working a second job to support his family: his pregnant wife, Skylar (Anna Gunn), and his teenage son, Walt Jr. (R.J. Mitte), who has cerebral palsy. Desperately hard up for money and constantly put down by those around him, Walt reaches the breaking point when he's diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. He connects with former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to start making and selling methamphetamines in order to raise money for his struggling family."

10.0,22 June 2022,"This series presents ideas through the character of Walter White about whether people choose to be strong and be bad or weak and be good. In my opinion most of the people support Walter but some of the supporters would do what Walter did because they wouldn't have the courage to exorcise their inner demon. Every man does selfish acts when he has the courage, and Walter White is the best example of this. These were some of the philosophical areas of study on human beings in the series. In addition, the series has a beautiful story, metaphors, thoughts, cinematography and lines."

My favourites are mr white , especially Gustavo fring ,hank . The plot of series is amazing And it's really good to watch how the charector grows of mr white ,and how his life changes after incident and after he meet his fellow student.

Jesse charector is also amazing and he is kind hearted person and it's also amazing to see how jesse charector evolve .

Gustavo fring charector is amazing, as well as charector of Saul Goodman. And hank Shredder I was binge watching episodes of breking bad.

It has mind-blowing moments . I recommend this to everyone 👍"

10.0,20 October 2019,"A man can be anything seriously,at one moment he can be a school chemistry teacher and at the next moment he can this most wanted man in the town due to multiple crimes including drug business,robbing a train, attempting lots of murders in his interests..I mean there is no limit for the character here to do things in the name of his family.

This simply shows that one person can be this much dark at a time and bright as well at other point.The one thing I liked about this leading character is he is just fearless to do anything,he doesn't have anxiety issues,he is not obviously coward at all,he is a real man,he understands that he is a man he have to do things that is best suited for his family,it doesn't matter for him whether his family love him or wait for his death,it doesn't matter his son is abusing him,he just want to provide the drug money to them.

He has this hard heart that he goes on murdering hell lot of people,but it didn't affect him mentally,while Jesse finds it hard to deal with his ongoing emotions.

Walter white is also very much greedy for money,it doesn't matter for him whatever hell may happen,he doesn't seem to be demotivated, demoralized to start his illegal drug empire again and again

He is right at his cooking after every tragedy,he is playing around and using his brother-in-law all the way,until his brother-in-law actually finds his truth.

I think Walt and her wife had hurted Mike and her wife so much,but they were still very much supportive at times to them,so I felt very bad at Mike's death and about her wife,yes her wife is kind of a thief,which found certainly unexpected at times.

Walter White was certainly luckiest,smartest,selfish,rock hard character shown in this web series,where I think we must face situations in our life like this,I mean we can't kill the people who betrays us,put us down,bullies us,threatens us in real life,just like Mr. white did in this series,but we can at least forget,forgive those people and situations,get out of the city where you live,get away from the people who let you down and always go for a new start at new place somewhere,which may turn out to be fruitful for everybody.

This web series is so much addictive,I binged watched for 1 week to finish it totally."

The script is amazing, down to the actors, and the story of the series is an original one. Walter White is a complex character that can be viewed from several perspectives. I like this character from beginning to end. Jessie starts this series and unlocks a desire for him, which is money and power. In ultimele 2 sezoane devine din ce in ce mai palpitant fiecare personaj isi incheie socotelile sau pentru unii este capatul drumului. It is a superb series and it is worth watching by all fans of movies."

10.0,7 July 2024,"Favourite moments by far are when characters are talking either during down time or big reveals, incredibly well written for the most part

Show just keeps getting better and better season by season as the shenanigans and consequences deepen, leading to great character moments and plot points.

My only downside is Skyler and sometimes when characters act too impulsively, I understand irl this happens but it was too far at some points and made the characters look stupid. Also Skyler is really well done and acted but she's just written to be annoying, at least to, to such a degree that at certain points I wanted to skip scenes she was in, though I entirely get it's her character I just think she was the weakest character.

I loved the pacing, really gave you time with every character and for scenes to set in."
10.0,7 December 2023,"Like someone on meth, watching Breaking Bad provides a mixture of intense despair and exhilaration. One watches with open mouth how Walt fights cancer, how he cooks meth, how he bypasses the traps set, how he builds his fortune, how he loses it, how he rebuilds it, how he defeats his enemies and always comes out victorious. I say this without exaggeration: among the 45 TV series I've watched, there's something like Breaking Bad, where the script and characters are handled down to the smallest detail, where the story and dialogue are in perfect harmony, with a script that will leave your mouth open while watching, and where you can both love and love the characters in such a wonderful way. There is no other series that can make one hate others, develop such a high-quality character infrastructure, have such high-quality dialogue, and have such an impact on a person when it ends. There are so many beautiful details that I watched it 3 times and I notice something new every time I watch it."

10.0,4 February 2021,"This show is the best show to come out on regular cable. Period. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Be careful. This show is designed in a way that makes it very bingey. So, you might see all of it too quickly. Take your time and enjoy the show. Walter is one of the best characters in all of TV.

Each season also gets more intense as the show goes on.

The show is dark, with good acting, if you do not enjoy dark themes, you may not like it.

But overall, it has a good plot, good story, great acting, amazing cinematography, funny dialogue. It is not perfect, but I would give it a 9.5 out of 10."

Exceptional is an understatement. Just watch Better Call Saul and you will understand the details and the thought process that the creators and writers go into."
10.0,15 October 2020,"I have never came across something like this in my entire life time. This isn't just a web-series when you watch it, it becomes a part of you. A part you want to live again with a fresh start.

Talking about the story-line: Considering I have two more episodes left to watch, till now I thank every minute of my time that I have spent seeing this web-series. Fun fact is I didn't knew what I am going to experience when I started seeing it, it was completely random but now It is the finest art work I have ever done. The story holds much more than one can imagine by looking at it. It has enough action, a lot of tensed situations, and lot's of unpredictability. At once you are thinking that this is going to happen now but in the other moment circumstances drastically changes. Vince Gilligan has put every thought that has been in his mind in it and it's really creative and interesting.

Acting: Every actor has given their best of the performances and every character you see in this series is one of the finest in his role. My favorite is Giancarlo Esposito (Gus) who has done tremendous work, he is just professional in it. Notwithstanding only 'Gus' if you see this series you will connect yourself with every character. And in acting it's just 10/10

Darkness: Makers has tried to show the best of what a drug addict, criminal or officer life is like. They have tried to capture what goes really in the streets, the harsh reality of life and criminals. The story goes with how as simple as water like man (Walter White) faces life and how life makes him choose the paths he goes on with. There are some really dark and disturbing scenes and stories in this series but the way all this is presented to us is award-winning.

You many have seen many people saying that this series will change your mindset and that's true in many many ways. After completing this series you will learn that how there is always a way for everything. How life gives you lemons and how you can make lemonade with it.

If you are reading this review and is thinking to watch this series, I bet you won't stop after the very first episode. This review is completely based on what I have experienced. You may see this pieces in a different way but you will never regret a second of your life spent in watching this series."
10.0,15 March 2019,"6 years after the final season I decided to watch Breaking Bad. Wow! This is a near perfect show with phenomenal acting by Bryan Cranston and others portrayed in a well sophisticated and jaw dropping manner. I could go on and on about this show, but like I am telling others that have never watched this show...WATCH BREAKING BAD! You will not be disappointed!"
10.0,5 February 2020,This one is the best. It's start and ending both are awesome. I'm gonna watch it again and again.

10.0,13 December 2019,ONE OF THE FINEST SERIES EVER MADE no other tv show can comoete with it or will compete with it for ages to come. Will be my favourite of all content out there in world
9.0,17 September 2024,"Breaking Bad is arguably one of the greatest TV series ever made. The brilliance lies in the genius of Walter White's character, the intricate plot, and the depth of all the supporting characters. From his transformation from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin, every moment grips you, making it impossible to look away.

However, this show isn't for the faint of heart. There are no happy moments, and certainly no happy ending. The intensity and emotional weight build as the story progresses, leaving you both in awe and emotionally drained by the time it concludes.

If you're looking for a dark, complex, and utterly addictive series, Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch."
10.0,31 May 2024,"""Breaking Bad,"" created by Vince Gilligan, is a groundbreaking television series that aired from 2008 to 2013. Widely regarded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time, it tells the compelling story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking and selling methamphetamine after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. The show explores themes of morality, power, and transformation, with a perfect blend of intense drama, dark humor, and thrilling action.

At the heart of ""Breaking Bad"" is Bryan Cranston's unforgettable portrayal of Walter White. Cranston's performance is a masterclass in acting, capturing Walter's transformation from a meek, desperate teacher into the ruthless drug kingpin known as Heisenberg. This evolution is gradual and meticulously detailed, allowing viewers to understand and, at times, empathize with Walter's increasingly morally ambiguous actions. Cranston's ability to convey the complexities of Walter's character-his pride, desperation, and cold calculation-is nothing short of remarkable.

Aaron Paul co-stars as Jesse Pinkman, Walter's former student and partner in crime. Paul delivers a raw and emotionally charged performance that provides a stark contrast to Walter's calculated ambition. Jesse's character arc is marked by profound personal struggle, as he battles addiction, guilt, and a deep-seated desire for redemption. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is central to the series, evolving from a dysfunctional mentor-student relationship to a toxic, co-dependent partnership fraught with tension and betrayal.

The supporting cast of ""Breaking Bad"" is equally exceptional. Anna Gunn's portrayal of Skyler White, Walter's wife, adds depth and complexity to the narrative. Skyler's journey from a supportive spouse to a conflicted, complicit partner in Walter's crimes is compelling and believable. Dean Norris as Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law and a dedicated DEA agent, brings intensity and determination to his role, adding layers to the show's cat-and-mouse game. Betsy Brandt as Marie Schrader and RJ Mitte as Walter White Jr. Also contribute strong performances that enhance the show's exploration of family dynamics and the impact of Walter's descent into crime.

""Breaking Bad"" is renowned for its exceptional writing and storytelling. Vince Gilligan and his team of writers craft a narrative that is both tightly plotted and richly layered. The series is masterful in its use of foreshadowing, symbolism, and thematic exploration, creating a cohesive and immersive story that rewards attentive viewers. The dialogue is sharp, often laced with dark humor, and adds a distinctive flavor to the show's tone.

Visually, ""Breaking Bad"" is striking and innovative. The cinematography, primarily overseen by Michael Slovis, captures the stark beauty of the New Mexico landscape, using it as a backdrop for the show's intense and often violent narrative. The use of color, particularly the symbolic blue of Walter's high-purity methamphetamine, adds a visual depth that complements the storytelling. The series' visual style is both gritty and cinematic, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

The music in ""Breaking Bad,"" including its memorable opening theme by Dave Porter, plays a significant role in setting the tone and atmosphere. The soundtrack features an eclectic mix of genres that underscore key moments and contribute to the show's unique identity.

""Breaking Bad"" is also notable for its exploration of morality and the consequences of one's choices. Walter's journey is a study in the corrupting influence of power and the human capacity for rationalizing immoral actions. The series does not shy away from depicting the brutal and often tragic outcomes of Walter's decisions, offering a sobering reflection on the cost of ambition and the fragility of human relationships.

In conclusion, ""Breaking Bad"" is a tour de force in television storytelling, distinguished by its stellar performances, masterful writing, and striking visual style. The series' exploration of complex characters and moral dilemmas resonates deeply, creating a narrative that is both compelling and thought-provoking. Vince Gilligan's creation has left an indelible mark on the landscape of television, setting a high standard for dramatic storytelling and character development."
10.0,31 July 2020,It was a lockdown in India because of COVID-19 and this series make my boring lockdown curfew special.. Walter White and Aaron paul I miss them thill this day. I liked the concept too it was simple and the acting was too amazing.. I liked the production too.. From where to where they have taken this series from season 1 to 5 it is my 2nd best tv seres after prison break.. great work Vince Gilligan
10.0,18 July 2020,"Man this one really hit the spot, like it's the BOMB yo. Seriously, this is in a long time something has sprung my emotions so bad. Most of the time you're guessing what's gonna be the person's next move (there are many excellent characters so this applies to most of them) and BAM you're left wondering what the hell you saw. Acting, story-telling and all, they look top notch and realistic. This series may have started a liking towards crime genre for me.

Ps: I didn't even start the final season before writing this."
9.0,12 September 2019,Love this show period. Truly amazing work by amc. I loved the writing and acting. Paced beautifully through and through.
10.0,14 March 2018,"This is the best series if all time. can I say anything else? this is like the Jumanji game, it sucks you inside, the acting and the plot is so natural that you really fell that you are in VR (this actually a great idea, to make this one available on VR devices:)) ) and also perfect dialogues. Breaking Bad shows different aspects of human beings, their darkest spots that they kept well hidden for years until something triggers them out. if you don't watch this, you have just wasted your whole life."
10.0,9 January 2020,"The best tv show ever. Fantastic story, good directing, great actors."
10.0,2 April 2021,"Wow! The Greatest serial i watched it for 4times.

If you havenot seen that you are a crazy man😑"
10.0,19 October 2013,"Unforgettable, an instant classic, Breaking Bad delivers in every department.

It's such a joy to escape and delve into Walter Whites world, escaping your own for a while.

Sublimely written, an amazing plot that unfolds perfectly and leaves you wanting and waiting for more, Cranston brings Walter to life so much so you get pulled in and absorb everything, but hats off to many of the cast especially Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk and Anna Gunn.

Annas character Skyler was also amazing, I found myself hating Skyler which just lends and validates Annas skill set as an actress.

What an incredible show Breaking Bad is, it has raised the bar and left me saddened it's over."
10.0,28 August 2022,"The first half of season 1 is terrible, the second half is great. The second eeason is a grind and then from s3 to 5 it doesn't stop getting better. Ending off with s5 which is just amazing.

There a few plot hes which get on my nerves but its a small detail in comparison wuth how well written the charecters and plot turn out to be. The fireshadowing is amazing but I have one main gripe. The flash forwards, a cheap way to add tension. And they really dpn't need to, the show has enough tension and enough going to keep you invested without bein shown the ending at the beginning. Ut really cheapens the show."
10.0,31 December 2013,"After countless months of everyone talking about breaking bad, and hearing so much about the show, I decided I just had to give in and check it out.

I'm currently almost finished season 3, and to be honest, I don't think I can take much more of it. I mean I'm 3 seasons in and that ""WOW, did that just happen?!"" moment hasn't happened yet, and to be honest I don't think it will.

It's over-hyped for sure - I mean for this to get a 9.5 on IMDb, I think a few people were smoking some of that blue meth, because I just don't see it.

It gets very boring at times, and there's no real character development. Most of the central characters aren't very likable. The whole story just doesn't make sense - and every move the characters make, I can't help but wondering why? because it just doesn't seem like something they'd do.

Don't get me wrong, it's not a horrible programme. Despite the flaws, it's a decent watch, but I just can't get hooked on it. Will I continue to watch it? I don't know. But it's not a 9.5 programme. Metacritc gave it a 70 which is probably about right. I guess it appeals to airheads, and gives meth-heads a voice. 6.8/10"
10.0,5 March 2021,"Its just the best. Acting is perfect, plot is perfect. The characters are perfect l. Everything is perfect. Its just amazing, best series ever made."
10.0,22 June 2020,I honestly wish i could erase my memory to watch this show for the 1st time again.
10.0,11 January 2021,I have not watched a lot of series but despite that I can confidently say this is one of the best ones out there. There isn't much to say that hasn't already been said about this show but it is absolutely flawless and has left me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole time watching it. It has definitely changed me as a person.
10.0,12 August 2012,"""Breaking Bad"" is not just any TV Show and calling it such would trivialize such an unbelievable exercise into it's brilliance which personifies the great heights that can be achieved on the small screen. The reason I consider it being under-rated is because it is proving to be leaps and bounds above every other show in it's time (barring Game of Thrones) and it's progression is not merely surprising but awe-inspiring and has not received the praise warranted till very recently.

Created by Vince Gilligan, it tells the story of Walter White, an under-achieving genius chemist who after being diagnosed with cancer that would lead to his inevitable death decides to cook meth to save money for his family once he passed on. What starts out as a sort of ""valiant"" attempt in taking care of his family, turns into a world which transforms him due to the incidents that befall him during this endeavour. ""Breaking Bad"" was a very good show in it's first three seasons, but since then it has transformed itself into being one of the greatest and boldest achievements in TV History.

Central to it's brilliance is it's amazing cast. Bryan Cranston, who was best known for being the goofy father in ""Malcolm in the Middle"" has against all the odds transformed that image to show us the versatility that is as surprising as it is riveting. He is more than ably supported by Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn (who has been at her best in Seasons 4 and 5)who complement the nature of the duplicity that has become a part of Cranston's life. Even though the writing in the show is brilliant, it is the portrayal of the actors of their characters which really brightens the material as they portray their metamorphosis with a brilliant pace and realism which one would not think would be possible (especially from Gunn). Solid supporting performances are provided by Betsy Brandt, Dean Norris and Bob Odenkirk. The most memorable supporting performances however come from Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito and Mark Margolis, the latter two being awarded deserved Emmy nominations this year.

However, all this would not have been possible had it not been for Vince Gilligan who brings us a world where ordinary people are faced with extraordinary circumstances and their battle to be able to live through them. The show is more of a testament towards survival than anything else and Gilligan's protagonist (White) is central to the vision of his creation.

All that being said, Cranston is it's highlight. His metamorphosis is the testament to what I think is what translates Gilligan's perspective. Season 5 is delving into the aspect even further and his brilliance as a character actor is evolving immensely which carries the show even though he is surrounded by very capable performances around him.

I am saddened by the fact that the show does not have much longer to go, but whatever conclusions do transpire, it was a privilege to see a character who could go toe-to-toe with some of the most memorable TV characters of all time. We are witnessing the rebirth of Bryan Cranston and he is stamping his revival with a show we will never forget. A lot of people are picking up on it recently, if you belong to this crowd at the moment I suggest you join the bandwagon because it is an experience which you will never forget."
10.0,7 October 2013,"It is the best TV show ever. EVERYONE is going to find it awesome. You watch it and your mind goes crazy.

If you watch 4 seasons, you are still not very sure about some things.. whats the real relationship between the two main characters? Do they like each other, or not?Do they care, or is it all about the money?? They play with your mind all the time. And the last season clears everything you have been wondering.

As about the main character, Heisenberg, the words are not enough. During the seasons you see his character changing and you can actually see his face changing.. What an amazing actor!

Every and each one of the characters is amazing. And thats the main reason why the show is so great.. You love love love them all! Even the ones you hate.."
10.0,20 October 2013,"Without a doubt, Breaking Bad is the best show ever created. Right from the pilot episode, this show had me engaged from start to finish. Every episode had meaning, emotion and humor, and there was not one episode that I felt was bad.

What makes breaking bad is the characters and the originality of the plot. The acting is magnificent. Even from the most minor character you can think of. The plot is outstanding and without the style, color and writing from the brilliant mind Vince Gilligan, the plot would not have worked. Vince was made to make this movie as the entire cast and crew were. The style of the show is so unique. Almost like a Tarantino film. The characters and writing are definitely something like a Tarantino film.

Season 1 starts off nice and easy with some slow paced moments, setting up the characters and plots in a smooth and timely manner. Season 2 kicks off straight away with suspense and curiosity. Season 3 is more family and drama based but is used so that the audience can connect to the characters even more and can feel for them. Season 4 is amazing. Every episode had its 'HOLY SH*T' moments. And lastly, season 5 is a masterpiece. The ending was extremely satisfying and left an imprint in your mind for days, weeks and months.

For the people missing out on Breaking Bad. You are missing out on a revolutionary show. From start to finish, this show will get you thinking, will make you sad, laugh and leave you to think that you were in an experience like no other. The Walking Dead is nothing compared to this masterpiece."

9.0,22 August 2009,"Awesome show! what I really like about it is that it really hooks you at the very beginning unlike some other shows that are also good. Like the Sopranos and the Wire for example. I got through the Wire and thought it was very good, but it took a few episodes to get into.

The Sopranos I didn't really get into after 2 episodes and decided not to watch it. This, though, hooked me with the very first few scenes.

The acting is superb and the story is wonderfully written. I also love the way the season 2 ended in that it could basically be an ending for the series if only two episodes were going to be there, but it also acts as a good link to more seasons (I think season 3 has already been announced).

Great Show! Everyone should watch this, except people who can't stand to see the darker sides of life."
10.0,9 February 2014,"The reader's opinions are spot on. But, all viewers need to accept that 'Breaking Bad' is pure entertainment ... not a morality play or the balance of good over evil. Greed, avarice, and moral voids are part of all human life. That, in itself, is what makes this one of the best (if not the best) of American crime series in the 21st Century. Just as Forbrydelsen (Danish) and The Killing plowed new fields, so is 'Breaking Bad'. Breaking bad - Especially our ongoing 'war on drugs' adds a special cachet to the stories. All future US crime / drug / action / justice - including crime and punishment genres will be judged by this marvelous series. Wonderful ... we will not miss one episode ... and we live in Asia. We love it. Better than 'The Wire,' 'The Shield,' or The Sopranos. We can only hope that they find a way to to approach the production values of Breaking Bad in future efforts. Not to be missed - excellente!"
10.0,19 December 2013,"This show is the greatest show I have ever seen. I'm not much of a TV- series fan but this one's mind-blowing. The plot is great. You'll never know what happens next. Acting is superb. There's isn't even one person in this series with poor acting.

The thrill is always nearby. I couldn't stop watching this TV-series. It was the most addictive thing I've ever seen on television.

Recommend this to EVERYONE!!!

This pitch-black comedy drama series is fantastic. The relations between the different characters are stunning. The creators of Breaking Bad have done a extraordinary job creating something that reaches all the way to the audience."
10.0,5 October 2013,"Breaking Bad represents an absolute example of putting the best ingredients (actors, directing, script, ...) in the filming recipe, which is really what makes the difference, i.e. you cannot say which part of the series is the strongest one. Another innovative characteristic of the show is the fact that it lacks irrelevant scenes put there just to fill the episode (e.g. see Vince Masuka role in Dexter, especially season 8). Thus, the script and the plot is very solid focusing around the characters created with an amazing and extraordinary way. Walter White (Bryan Cranston) is the most evolving character in TV history, starting from the ""good"" side and gradually going to the ""bad"" one, which justifies absolutely the show's title. The last season of Breaking Bad reaches the highest peak as far as acting is concerned with powerful dialogs and could easily represent an original Greek drama. Thanks everyone in Breaking Bad for the best moment in TV history which I definitely recommend."
10.0,16 January 2021,Brilliant writing and acting. A true masterpiece! I highly recommend it
10.0,15 October 2013,"I have got to admit I am not much of a TV show fan, but BrBA made me one.

I finished watching seasons 1 through 5 in less than a month. I guess you can understand how addictive BrBa is from that.

I tried watching several other TV shows but nothing came close. The most exciting feature of the show that I found is Mr. Walter White and his brilliance. Walter White is easily one of my favorite fictitious characters of all time.

The five seasons deal with different issues and all are equally incredible.

I have never felt so sad when a movie or TV show ended. It was truly heartbreaking, I thank the Breaking Bad team for making such an awesome show.

Miss you Mr. White!"

10.0,30 January 2021,If you've never seen Breaking Bad then you must see it. The best thing I've ever seen on a tv screen that wasn't a movie! In fact it probably beats almost all the movies I've ever seen too. And that's a lot. Every actor in it is 10/10. Pretty much faultless

10.0,1 April 2021,"This show is the best show I have ever seen in my life, and I'm 14! Despite this show being rated TV-MA, this show can be appropriate for teens as well. If you ever have a chance to watch it, WATCH IT!!! It's very dark, especially the last few episodes, but its a good type of dark that you'll love!"
10.0,8 January 2014,Every time I think about Breaking Bad or watch any of the last 3 episodes I feel like my hypothetical wife of ten years was R***d and K****d in front of me. im exaggerating a tad so plz don't be hateful. but my point is I get emotional and cry about every time. i had a 6 year relationship with this show. i watched the Pilot episode the day it aired and the never missed one episode NO JOKE! no show in the past or present is like they never existed so to speak. i mean they don't compare and i cant see how any shows in the future could trump the power this one had to captivate an audience. i hate to speak ill of this show but what im about to say is more of a pro than a con but the only episode that i disliked mostly was the fly episode where walt and jessi done nothing but try to catch that stupid fly. it was sort of a funny episode and a secret was almost revealed but that was it. so out of the 60+ episodes only one was kind of boring. 10/10 still. love it will always love it and plan to watch the entire series annually i done every season leading up to the next just before the new season would begin I'd watch the ones before to catch up. i done this for 5 years so needless to say i know this show very well.

10.0,6 February 2014,"We watched the entire 5 seasons over about 2 months.

I enjoyed it immensely.

Some parts are hard to watch - it's not for everyone, but it's funny, sad, disturbing, believable and really original.

The acting is incredible and Bryan Cranston thoroughly deserves every award he has won for Breaking Bad.

I've never watched a series where I've changed my feelings so much against main characters before, the character development is brilliant.

I don't think they'll ever make a series as good as this! I strongly recommend you give it a go!"
10.0,1 November 2020,"Perhaps one of the greatest shows ever made. Its gritty, humorous, insane and downright entertaining. Acting from every character is top shelf and writing cant be beat. Shows like this just dont happen very often so sit back and enjoy. Show is not for everyone but once you get into it, you wont be able to stop. This show set the bar for perfection! Give it 3 episodes and then bang! You are hooked till the end. Such a great show"

10.0,31 May 2010,"I just saw episode 3x10 and have only one thing to say: Whuawahua! It's just the best fiction I've seen for years. In France we call cinema the 7th art, in the US it's the industry of entertainment. In most cases, I prefer the American way of saying it. But for this episode, I'm on the French side Imagine the pitch: let's put two guys and a fly in a cave for 50 minutes. Who's crazy enough to accept such a scenario? The actors are so real, so sensitive, so violent and so fragile; I just fell in love with both. I leave next door to Godard, in Switzerland and I'm sure he'd like this challenge: no sex, no violence, no incredible camera effect, no make-up and no tricky scenario: just two guys in a cave with a fly. Only those incredible actors could have made it so tense and beautiful. Please go on!"
10.0,31 May 2021,"Yeah, but it is! So well written and acted. Almost everything in the show has some sort of symbolic meaning. And best of all, they ended the show and didn't milk it for another five years like they could have. Follow-up movie was just okay."

10.0,1 June 2021,Nothing to say here other than that this show is the best to ever be witnessed by humanity.
10.0,20 April 2012,"To all you independent filmmakers out there:

Take a look how this show is filmed. It is so simple yet gripping. There are no moving camera shots for the most part and the camera is always on a steady cam. No dollies involved and they use simple angles and very few close ups.

Shows like this inspire me to thinking that I can actually make something similar. As far as the writing, it is top notch and very layered. The writers pay off all their plot devices and set up them equally as good. I also like how they dwell on certain scenes for 4-5 minutes at a time. It creates a certain realism that emulates real life. As far as the content, it is captivating in a sick way, similar to Pulp Fiction and other black crime comedies.

My favorite part about this show is Aaron Paul and his madness. The show truly captures the up and down spiral of dealing drugs or doing them. There will always be downfalls and people going to jail or dying around you. One minute you have thousands, then the next you're left broke and have nothing. Some of the best moments are when Walter and AP are frantically disposing or moving drug money/paraphernalia. I love how they always hide sixty grand under the kitchen sink or in their vents.

A must see and definitely one of the best shows of the last decade."
10.0,28 January 2021,"The acting, story arc, and plot twists make this tv show one of the best to grace our planet."
10.0,18 September 2014,"I know my review will get lost in the shuffle of the hundreds that have already been posted, but I had to wade in and give my two thumbs up for this epic show. It's fabulously written, directed, produced, and acted. The character development is simply stunning, seizing you by the heart and pulling you right in, leaving you wanting to binge watch episode after episode. The tense action, real-life drama of family, and quirky humor all mesh together so well that you will feel that you know the characters as true as the real world. The show truly is the best one ever made.

Therefore, if you are one of the few who haven't seen Breaking Bad, let me just say that every other show that you choose to watch besides this one (i.e. you keep putting it off) is a lesser show by every measure, for the production quality, acting, and plots are second to none. I highly suggest with no reservation that if you have not seen this, then shame on you. Go seek immediate redemption by starting Breaking Bad now! You will not be disappointed."
10.0,16 June 2021,Just watch it. Impeccable acting and great storyline.
10.0,29 July 2020,"I really enjoyed this series because it is a complete show and without contradictions, but I felt that it is something simple and with a basic plot."
10.0,3 October 2020,I'm on my 5th rewatch and it never gets old! A modern masterpiece of television history. Beyond brilliant and absolutely incomparable. Utter perfection in every way.
10.0,12 August 2012,"The one TV show that will make you say ""Oh my God, that's amazing!"" So off-the-hook awesome! I was addicted the first episode. 10 OUT OF 10! It makes you fascinated in criminology and makes you want to scream when something horrible happens. You'll be pleased and be paying attention the whole time.

It makes you think though... the fact that there are actual people out there like that. It makes your blood curdle in a good way. That way where you just want to watch and read everything interesting there is to watch and read. I don't recommend for children though for many reasons...

..To many adult references.

But other that that, ha, WOW. So good. Watch it! Watch it now! :D"
10.0,20 August 2020,Let's just say it did what game of thrones couldn't do. Perfect beginning to perfect ending.
10.0,18 December 2011,"I was late to the game... kept hearing good things but never saw it. Finally I decided to dedicate some time, but I'm not one to jump into a story mid-stream.

Therefore I sought out Season One, Episode One, so I could begin at the beginning. You have to do the same if in a similar situation. The genius of the series is character progression, so you can't be random in when you start watching. The evolution of the people and their interwoven stories is the core of the series.

After the first few episodes, I was consumed in watching every show in order, as quickly as I could. It's simply brilliant.

Rather than re-hash the details, all I can say is it's worth the journey. The concept is wild, some of the characters can be annoying, and a lot of people will find holes in the storyline. Here's my reply: It's smarter than everyone watching. The writers are 10 steps ahead of you. You will be challenged, shocked, confused and irritated on a number of levels.

And that's why it is genius."
10.0,13 August 2014,"yes, it's time to judge my book from it's cover as i've said, there is no show can be better than BREAKING BAD it's the BEST OF THE BEST and i loved it a lot Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul presents a very beautiful characters and shows us the variety of all personalities from being happy, anger, High, and much more the story is very attractive people, charisma, everything in the show is so adorable and must be loved, scenes, crimes and the music inside are very mysterious and positive to grab your attention to get in the mood and watch all the series in a week without any interruption from anybody even if it's from your work, can't write about the show because if i want to do it then i must have at least a million lines to express the show"
10.0,26 August 2020,"Before breaking bad, I've watched many shows like GOT, Prison break, Money heist, Dark, many korean dramas and other top notch shows too.

But still everybody says that Breaking bad is the best show ever then this above mentioned show. I always wonder why and how can be this show is better then all my favorite shows...

I have watched this show recently and this show is really great but those who are saying that this show is better then every shows.. I don't think its true..

Every show has its own quality and genre and all the other shows can not be compared with this one only...

Overall I really like this show but still feel disappointed as people around me believes that this show is better than any show in this world...."
9.0,14 June 2021,"Acting is so good and realistic that i almost feel the same as the charecter , name anyone!!, everyone did his best job . When it comes to the story like it happens to the other movies or series, I cannot predict what going to happen next, I never feel like it's getting off the track . At last I would say a perfect start a perfect conclusion and brilliant story."
10.0,23 September 2013,"I can say this with utmost faith that there will never be another show like Breaking Bad. It is an incredible piece of art work that shows complex human relationships, how far a man's love for his family take him? How does an under-achiever handle his brilliance? Money, greed , power, addiction and crystal meth !! Breaking bad has it all!!!

And it gives us one of the greatest and complex characters of all time ( same at the level of the Joker of the Dark knight) . Heisenberg.

Yeah, remember this name, because once you start watching breaking bad, you will not forget it!

Bryan Cranston as Walter white is brilliant, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pink Man is stunning as well as hilarious.

So , those who have still not watched this greatest series of all time. Please do yourself a favor. And remember "" Its all in the Chemistry""!!"

10.0,14 November 2012,"Breaking Bad is the best show I've seen since The Wire.

The plot, characters and situations are fantastic.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of a man's descent into chaos and insanity is something I have never seen in a modern TV show.

The plots are carefully constructed and filled with action and tension.

The characters are lovingly realised and you care about every one, even the bad guys (of whom there are many).

The only fault with the show is that it doesn't focus on the downside of crystal meth i.e. the people who actually use the stuff. Despite this Breaking Bad is still the most watchable thing on TV at the moment.

Watch it!"
10.0,9 January 2021,"A few years ago I remember hearing about the hype, I stopped at episode 2. 2020 hits and I decided due to lockdown to give it another aho and I don't think I'll ever look at another Tv show again!!!! THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER AND WILL EVER WATCH. Everything about this is incredible and it hit every kind of emotion I didn't realise I could feel. Now it's over i feel like I'm in mourning lol you must watch this show in your life time."
10.0,31 January 2021,"Rewatching Breaking Bad during lockdown. Quite possibly the best tv show ever made. The writing, the acting, the cinematography- everything about this show is exceptional.

If you haven't seen it already then where have you been for the last 10 years?"
10.0,24 May 2020,"Where to start....perhaps this is the only tv show which has a repeat value and every time you repeat it grows on you. This has become a benchmark of all tv shows so far. 7 years have gone by after 'Felina' the final episode of season 5, and as on date there is not a single series which has been made which has been loved so much by so many people all over the world. Well GOT came close but they spoiled it all in their last season....

There is however a word of caution, if you plan to watch BB, because once you finish watching, you are not going to like any other series....its so damn perfectly loaded with entertainment value....

And same is the case with Better Call Saul which starts timid but as you start watching season after seasons and reach season 5, you will realise how it is taking you towards BB universe....both the series in Breaking Bad universe are best ever made tv series.....

To me Rating tv series like Breaking Bad on a 5 point scale or 10 point scale, is not possible or shall I say, perhaps we dont have a scale to rate series like Breaking Bad....it is much more beyond our film/tv rating system...."
10.0,21 April 2021,"As one of the best tv series I have ever watched, I took time to re watch the whole thing 5 times over. Each time as good as the first!

Gripping! An absolute rollercoaster of a journey to witness one man's change in perception to do what he needs to for his family; finding his excellence in meth cooking."

10.0,30 November 2020,I cannot describe how good this show is... from a chemistry teacher to a full on badass drug lord. This is one of the shows you can watch over and over again and still get the excitement out of each episode
10.0,1 June 2021,"I could watch this a thousand times. There's so much dark humor, conflict, and mayhem that there's no lag anywhere in the series. Can't find any plot holes either. Loved it."
10.0,3 September 2012,"It's not very often that I stump up a maximum for a TV Show or Movie on this site, yet every once in a while, sometimes unexpectedly you can come across something that is engrossing from start to finish.

It's strange to think that a programme as dark and unpredictable as Breaking Bad can bring such joy over the course of an hour, but with the truly excellent storyline and script handed to Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul ET AL by Vince Gilligan has really set the standard as to how shows like this should be done.

Everyone probably knows about the situation from the start of season 01, so i won't bore you with another break down of the goings on. What I personally loved right from the off was the fact that there seemed to be a finality to the series where it sets out a 'POSSIBLE' ending for the lead character; and because of this situation, the metamorphosis of Walter White from genius chemist and family man, to morally ambiguous, and threatening demeanour that he develops throughout the course of the series utterly encapsulates you when watching.

With that said, everyone's eyes should be following Walter's side-kick in Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), in some ways, when Walter does a nasty action, Jesse is always there to question the decisions made and acts as a sort of conscience. The development of their relationship defines the success of this programme and it is amazing to think that Aaron Paul's character was only initially slated for one series. By far and away the best decision the series made was keeping the two of them together.

With that, it must be said that together, Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston are the two most talented individuals on TV today, and people should really learn from them when dealing with a dark and twisted series such as this.

I for one cannot begin to recommend this programme more highly to anyone looking for a consistently witty, disturbing, tear jerking and visually stunning and relentless series that has maintained the highest possible standards to delight myself and fans over the last 5 seasons. I just hope I get the chance to buy this on Blu-Ray (in the UK - none so far and it's 2012!) so that i can further appreciate the vast array of visual artistry, isolation and spot on settings to enjoy for many years to come! - Thank you Vince Gilligan for making a truly brilliant show, and I for one will be very sad when the show finally comes to an end in 2013!"
10.0,1 April 2014,"""We're done when I say we're done!""

I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I have to Breaking Bad before. I personally admire the fact that the show pulls no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets.

Breaking Bad serves as a revelation, it's like watching a butterfly emerge from a chrysalis, Bryan Cranston delivers a heart-breaking performance as Walter White, an over-qualified chemistry teacher who discovers that he has cancer. This discovery completely changes his perspective on life, the realization that his mediocre life could soon be over and he has little to show for it triggers a change in life that simply leads from one amazing drama to the next.

Crystal meth is not something taken lightly in any drama, the show tackles these issues admirably by showing the ups and downs of dealing, the unsavory characters who Walter meets along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorize drugs; it does show what a human being is capable of put into various characters who Walt meets along his journey. What makes this show different is that it doesn't glamorize drugs, it does show what a human being is capable of put into various circumstances.

The atmosphere of the show is intense, epitomized by the brutal heat of Albequerque in which the characters often find themselves. The suspense and tension throughout is nerve wrecking. And then there are the shocks. The scream out loud moments.

The acting is what is really glorifying from every character. That being said Aaron Paul is magnificent, in fact it was decided not to kill off the character on the strength of his performance. He's a no-nonsense guy who does drugs and then tries to go clean; he falls in love; he cares about children - he must run the gamut of emotions in the series' five years. His relationship with Walt is sometimes compatible, sometimes antagonist, sometimes dangerous, and often frightening. Aaron is the good guy who does illegal things, but doesn't have Walt's mean streak.

The direction and writing in the show are top-notch and one is really surprised by how much you care and are involved by the characters. The cinematography is of the quality of an Oscar- winning film, as is the editing and the other technical aspects of the show.

Bryan Cranston's transformation is one riveting and absorbing performance as he moves towards the dark side, believable on both ends. As his drug whacked assistant follows suit while creator Vince Gilligan over the first four and a half seasons keeps a tight grip on storyline by introducing a series of intriguing and comic characters pertinent to the telling, keeping it buoyant and suspenseful with some powerful twists.

The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something of everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.

This is without a doubt one of the best shows out on television, it's great for any thrill-seekers that envy a good suspense and a terrific show. Some people are put off by the subject matter of this show but that should not put you off if you don't watch the show, you are missing out greatly. For these reasons Breaking Bad gets a 10/10."
10.0,29 January 2021,"One of the best series in history, if not the best It contains 62 episodes, but does not feel bored at any moment. A wonderful story and a wonderful sequence of events, a great scenario, a great production, a great production, the greatest representation and the greatest transformation in the characters in a wonderful way. Brian Cranston has done more than amazing. An unforgettable and unforgettable performance And Aaron Paul makes you as if you were watching the series on the ground It really is the best"
10.0,26 August 2014,"Let the words of Sir Anthony Hopkins speak for this TV show. He sent this letter to Bryan Cranston after he finished watching the entire series.

""Dear Mister Cranston.

I wanted to write you this email - so I am contacting you through Jeremy Barber - I take it we are both represented by UTA. Great agency.

I've just finished a marathon of watching ""BREAKING BAD"" - from episode one of the First Season - to the last eight episodes of the Sixth Season. (Ed note: There are in fact five seasons of Breaking Bad; this might have been wishful thinking.) (I downloaded the last season on AMAZON) A total of two weeks (addictive) viewing.

I have never watched anything like it. Brilliant!

Your performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen - ever.

I know there is so much smoke blowing and sickening bullshit in this business, and I've sort of lost belief in anything really.

But this work of yours is spectacular - absolutely stunning. What is extraordinary, is the sheer power of everyone in the entire production. What was it? Five or six years in the making? How the producers (yourself being one of them), the writers, directors, cinematographers.... every department - casting etc. managed to keep the discipline and control from beginning to the end is (that over used word) awesome.

From what started as a black comedy, descended into a labyrinth of blood, destruction and hell. It was like a great Jacobean, Shakespearian or Greek Tragedy.

If you ever get a chance to - would you pass on my admiration to everyone - Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Aaron Paul, Betsy Brandt, R.J. Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks, Steven Michael Quezada - everyone - everyone gave master classes of performance ... The list is endless.

Thank you. That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence.

You and all the cast are the best actors I've ever seen.

That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It's almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.

Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor.

Best regards

Tony Hopkins. """

10.0,19 April 2011,"I've seen many television shows, and almost of every worth while movie ever produced. In my opinion this is on of my top five favorite in either category. The story is captivating and will grip your attention throughout every minute(you won't be getting up for a drink). My favorite aspect of the series would have to be the acting witch is incredible. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal, and portrays his character to the letter. With the perfect combination of action, drama, and material thats makes you think this is by far one of the best television series to ever hit the air waves joining the likes of ""The Sopranos"" ""OZ"" ""The Wire"" and in my opinion ""Dexter"" witch is another superb series. What I find most incredible about it is they are able to create such a fantastic experience on cable T.V. without the freedoms of HBO and SHOWTIME. GREATTTTTT SHOW. WATCH IT!!!!!!"
10.0,2 August 2020,"Character driven story with a lot of layers!

The main story follows the unlikely character of chemistry teacher, Walter White.

THIS REMINDED ME OF: Funnily enough this plot made me think of a game project I was working on, during uni. What with the chicken factory, and chemistry lab in the back! We used an old granny instead, but I agree that an old man was better fit. I was always embarrassed about this silly story, but I never knew that it had this much potential! It just shows. If you know how to execute something properly, you're on to a winner!

OVERALL: A true masterpiece from start to finish! If you have finished this, continue with the film, ""El Camino"", then, ""Better Call Saul"". Watch how there is more to the story than just Mr. White and his problems. Although we know this, we haven't made the connection with the other characters, as much as we have with the main characters, which is normal.

Throughout the show, I started to feel annoyed at Mr.White, then with Mrs.White, as well as being annoyed with Jesse. Yet, you don't want them to suffer in any way, and you hope that they can keep striking lucky and slip through the cracks.

Afterwards, you wonder if the decisions by Fring and Mr.White were necessary? But you can't help feeling emotionally attached to Jesse, Mr.White, and even Mr.Fring and Mike!

As the story unravels like an onion, you begin to feel curious about the back story to the many characters we encounter. It was interesting to open up the back story of our trusted lawyer friend, Saul Goodman. Then you find that his name was really Jimmy McGill, and the plot thickens!

I was at the edge of my seat, wanting to watch a little bit more every night!

Just as Robert Downey Jnr was made for the character of Marvel's Iron Man, Bryan Cranston was made to be Mr.White. Writer & director, Vince Gilligan created a true masterpiece here! Wow! Respect yo!"
10.0,27 July 2020,The best show ever made end of nothing comes close
10.0,9 July 2015,"This is not a serial. It is actually a 45+ hours long movie!!!! Well, I haven't exactly counted the hours and minutes, but 62 episodes, each approx. 45 minutes, so give or take...

Very intriguing and unique plot, superb direction, perfect castings and superior performance of all casts. But the three actors are by far the most outstanding of all. They are 1) Arron Paul playing Jessie Pinkman, 2) Dean Morris playing DEA Agent Hank Schrader and 3) Bob Odenkirk as Lawyer Saul Goodman. When these actors are on the screen, you couldn't take your eyes off them. If Breaking Bad was actually a movie, these three would be De facto owners of Oscar nominations. They are razor sharp in their respective characters. Bob Odenkirk has striking resemblance of Adam Sandler and he is superbly funny.

Every episode keeps full grip on you. Barring a few short fillers, all episodes are non-stop intense and grasp your full attention.

This is the ""Shawshank Redemption"" of TV serials! Every one must watch."
10.0,5 August 2020,This is the best show ever Brayan cranston and arron paul are great I hate skyler Walter white is darkest character in world Season 5 is perfect
10.0,14 July 2020,"It is one of the best shows I have ever seen, solid ending. Good acting and well directed"
10.0,18 October 2014,"First of all I am not a fan of TV series , specially if it is like 5 seasons or more. But from the very fist episode of Breaking Bad I knew there is something different in here. The story and dialogue will grip you from the first episode till the end...The Idea is very new , you will be confused with the Walter's personality through the episode.. you don't know whether to agree or disagree with him. the dialogue is brilliant as when you listen you will agree with the ideas in it but it will leave you uncertain about the main concept. I give Walter, Jesse, Hank 10/10, Skyler and Marie 6/10. their performance is not convincing or they set up them like that, I don't know but at least Skyler is better than Marie. The season 5 is best of the best , each move, each word should be studied well."
10.0,15 August 2020,This show is the best omg. It's a masterpiece. The acting is so so good.
10.0,28 November 2021,The whole TV Show is about the lie of a man. And when one lie is told others will come and we see how trough all the season how Walter White will save himself from others with the lie that he told to them and how he will survive in this difficult world of drug business. Its very interesting and have some great moments and big revelations. And i think the most incredible moments are when Walter white will face the impact of his lies and how he will deal with this.
10.0,23 May 2020,"A series much recommended to watch. Found s bit slow at start (personal opinion), but took a lot of my interest till the end. Worth watching!"
10.0,2 July 2021,"Breaking Bad is the ultimate representation of the beauty of TV. It's use of theme, color, and symbolism makes it one of the most thought-provoking and addicting shows of the 21st century and of all time."
10.0,29 May 2021,This movies is a masterpiece.... Walter white and Jesse pink man were incredible...please we want more seasons or stories like that...
10.0,7 June 2020,"Breaking bad is the best serie you can see ever ,It's actions , The drama , the family dramatic moments , how he transformed from a classic chemistry teacher to the best meth maker in the world"
10.0,21 April 2019,"Awesome, Amazing. I kept learning how good it was and I kept saying: No thankyou."
10.0,1 June 2021,"This is the one and only show with everything to perfection. It definitely deserves 10/10 rating.

There are other shows comparable to BB but they fail cause of their ending.

BB is the best show ever :)"
10.0,9 February 2017,"I first watched Breaking Bad when it ran on TV and eagerly awaited each season and episode. It was an amazing piece of work as Vince Gilligan crafted a wonderfully interesting and creative story with well defined characters who were allowed to develop over the course of the series and tell their story. I just recently watched Breaking Bad again on Netflix and fell in love with it all over again. I applaud Vince for having a start to the story, a middle and a definite end that he held to over the 5 seasons. He knew where he was going with it and helped it get there and then let it end. He did not allow the networks talk him into extending the story to squeeze another season out of it as they do with many other show. This should be required viewing for every budding producer or screenwriter as too how it can be done."
10.0,3 September 2022,"Like the title says, it's not bad. Only watched it three times. Saw El Camino three times too, and Better Call Saul only once. I've been to ABQ already and visited some filming locations, kind of boring. Planning to bring my dad from Ukraine in the future and visit some BB locations with him as well, he also thinks that the show is not bad, kind of below average. I am planning to rewatch the whole thing again with my wife (BB, BCS, EC) at some point. Maybe will give it a better score and revise this review. There isn't much more to say about this show anymore, just filling in the characters to submit this review. Really can't add anything else to a mediocre TV show."
10.0,26 May 2020,"If any TV show has to be given 10/10, it has to be Breaking Bad! Just perfect! Brilliant direction, superb acting and amazing storyline.."
10.0,30 July 2021,"Before I watched breaking bad I had heard a lot about the show : ""overated"" ""boring"" ""dragged out"".

I have to say I was quite shocked when I did not find it boring at all. I can understand why people call it slow but you have to stick with it to enjoy it. At the start, the plot seems interesting but I found it quite predictable. However the plot quickly improves and becomes more thrilling and unpredictable. There are amazing moments especially at the end of seasons but what the show does best is dealing with characters. There is a great development of characters and how psychological problems affect how you act. It also positions you in a position where you side with walt the main character even when he is wrong. It is a great ride through how walt and jesse deal with problems and physiological issues that are difficult to escape from. The biggest question I was asking after the series is is Walt a good person? He does a lot of questionable things in the series but has a moral priority. Overall you should definately watch this series even if you find it boring . It may not be your cup of tea but most people will turn out to enjoy it. I believe that game of thrones is better until the ending but this is definately close behind it."
10.0,13 May 2020,It is really good. All the characters are interesting. Watch it.
10.0,23 May 2020,"This is the best show that has ever existed nothing can compare to this. Perfect story, perfect cinematography, perfect acting, perfect ending. Once you will finish it you will never be able to find something as good as this. Neither Game of thrones can not compare to it ( and I am a huge fun of Game of thrones too)."
10.0,21 September 2020,"Let me just say it takes a lot for me to say, ""HEY THERES THIS SHOW I REALLY LOVE ...,"" Breaking Bad definitely got me to say this . I freaking love the acting, the plot , and just plain Walter White!!! You must watch this , I guarantee you , you'll be the same as me at the end!! Heisenberg is my man!!"
10.0,28 July 2021,"I've watched so many series's but no Series can give me the Thrill, Joy and Fun like Breaking Bad.

The character development of Walter H White, being a High School Chemistry teacher to the Drug lord Heisenberg, and a careless student JESSÉ PÌNKMÅN transforms from a low level street drug dealer to claiming strength almost as Heisenberg. It develops the characters in a terrific way.

And maintains a steady level of consistency throughout its 62 episodes is not a joke...

And the dedication of Bryan Cranston Having french beard style and Shaved head most of the time and also Jesse transformation is can't described in words.

MASTERPIECE!"
10.0,24 May 2020,"This show grips you till it's very end. One of the only show which keeps getting better with every season. Every individual growth is showed beautifully. Great Writing, And great performance."
10.0,28 January 2021,This is just a perfect series. From beginning to end. With a prequel series and a sequel movie. The actors are well chosen and the acting is on another level. Story is incomparable
10.0,4 October 2014,"This is an amazing TV series as it is a package : crime,drama,emotions,brains, in short WOW. Walter White is a super intelligent chem teacher who has lived a simple life and has done nothing wrong EVER.Then one day he is diagnosed of lung cancer and he breaks bad.He wants to leave money for his family so he partner up with a former student of his i.e. Jesse Pinkman n cooks meth, which is like the purest anybody have ever seen. In their journey of cooking and selling, they come across extreme situations but always finds a way to snap out of it. Walt's split personality is the X-factor as we never expect a normal guy turn into a high class criminal. It's definitely not for everybody, people who like crime based shows and admire some serious acting will love it. I haven't finished it but the suspense is awesome, the best part is the first scene of every episode, it just makes you wanna not miss any minute of the rest of the episode. You feel attached to the characters not because you are sympathetic but they are actually lovable. Superb acting by Bryan Cranston and that is not at all doubtful but Aoron Paul as Jesse Pinkman is so cute and totally fits in this role. Even if you are not a TV series kinda person, trust me you'll complete this one.It's as addictive as the blue meth of heisenberg ;)."
10.0,30 January 2021,"I love Breaking Bad. Every episode is filled with nothing but excellent story telling and world building about a normal man who broke bad and came to the drug world. They ended at the right time, and set up ""Better Call Saul"" perfectly. It's Great show and if your an adult and you haven't seen this show, you should see it as soon at you can. It is still the greatest series to ever hit Television."
10.0,9 June 2021,This series is dope. Must watch. Work of actors is oscar winning.
10.0,26 May 2020,The best tv series I have ever watched. Could watch it over and over again! No series has matched up to this!!!
10.0,30 August 2011,"Some of the idiots who are rating Breaking Bad poorly and knocking it for stereotyping and poorly developed characters are just that..idiots. It is TV!!!! Of course most of it would probably NOT happen as it does on the show but when you are condensing LIFE into a 1 hour segment for television, it often WILL seem stereotypical! Yes, the lead character and his partner escape death too many times to believe and yes, some of the BAD guys seem to far-fetched(the 2 Mexican Hit-man) to believe but the show WORKS on so many levels if you approach it with a open mind and are WILLING to suspend some truths. I love the show and think that other than a couple of ""writer's liberties"" the show is dead on and very very entertaining! If you need absolute truth(all you who knock the show) go read some Dali lama books!!"
10.0,26 January 2022,"The first season is good, its sort of like the foundation of your house. Then it starts to build up. Brick by brick the house build, the stories build, the tension builds. Then all of a sudden, the rug is pulled out from behind you. Its an amazing rollercoaster ride that makes you laugh, cry, and sweat. Bravo to everyone who worked on this show."
10.0,21 April 2021,"What do I even say? This show is perfect. The characters, the acting, the cinematography, the symbolism, the EVERYTHING. Wish I could wipe my brain to watch it over and over again."
10.0,28 May 2020,"Well this is the most detailed show and rewatch is always rewardable.Performances well,Bryan Cranston as Walter White is the best performance on tv ever.personal favourite season is season 5.Just in love with walter's character and the finale was the best finale ever created."

10.0,6 August 2020,"Breaking Bad (Personal Fav): It is the series that made me think of what really emotions and feelings are. Breaking bad was just phenomenal .The direction and the plot was at the next level that no one other than Mr. Vince Gilligan can think of . Ever since i was born ,I have never seen a series which is binded with everything in one i e., the plot , the cast, the direction , even the bgm was soothing to the whole background of the plot.The foreshadowing parts was perfectly executed by the director . The whole crew is responsible for the huge success of this series and they certainly earned it. Till now there is no other series that exceeds 9.5 rating in IMDB. Now about this character walter white aka heisenberg is a selfish, cold blooded criminal . His villain ism and attitude was off the limits. At some extend of this play he even tried to kill a 7 year old for his own benefits and made other think that they were responsible for all these crap.His unconditional love towards meth business started to grow vigorously and turned him into a devil.Jesse Pinkman was the person who walter used like nothing and moreover he was the most affected for all the deadly deeds done by the selfish and cunning heisenberg. Each and everyone in this series acted as if it is real i e., Skyler White, Mike Ehrmantraut, Gustavo Fring, Walter White jr, Hank, Jane, Tuco,Marie,Saul, Skinny ,Badger,Steeve Gomez,Lydia,Hector Salamanca,Gale Boetticher etc and even those who played a teeny tiny role made the whole series mind blowing . If at all we miss this series, then it will be a huge loss for us. As a breaking bad fan , It is a Must Watch series."
10.0,14 August 2021,Best TV Show IMO. It Gets Better Every Season. The Characters Are Very Realistic.
10.0,27 May 2020,Its so toucing and the way the parts have acted its like they are part our our lives .. its brillant .. cant have a gr8 seriss than this one. Its tremandous

10.0,3 October 2020,"I cannot think of any way this could have been better. The title, character development, camera work, storyline, directing, everything was just right."
10.0,29 January 2021,No series will match breaking bad Walter shows his love for Jessie is a beautiful thing
10.0,13 September 2014,"Breaking Bad is the only piece of watchable media to truly change my opinion on how to critique film and television. it is not only the best written, edited, and directed show, but takes those components to a level of excellence which I thought impossible by the television industry. The acting lead Bryan Cranston is not only worthy of any Emmy or Golden Globe, But of Oscar winning standard. The shows brilliance is also made visually, with beautiful cinematography, colour palette and camera angles. But where Breaking Bad really excels is its characters. How they react, change and deal with problems. this is done in a way only dreamed, let alone performed by any other show-runner and TV writer.

But when i try to recommend Breaking Bad to someone in a way that it is a critical masterpiece, people become hesitant. That is where Breaking Bad is special, it works for both a critics and viewers.

How the almost Comedic sounding ""the story of Walter White a high school Chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin"" turned into this; i do not know. all i know is that this seemingly innocent 5 season crime drama, has raised the bar for television and has changed the game on every level..."
9.0,28 May 2020,Once you start you can't stop. You can never go wrong with this show!
8.0,2 November 2021,"Nice I loved it but It's kind of old so you have to wait for one and two season and after second season the real thrriller starts ..... So tell me is these review useful?

I know it is."

9.0,19 August 2020,"I almost didn't watch this show. For awhile I didn't think I'd be interested in a show about meth. I don't think there's a bad episode of this show. There is so much character development. So many emotional moments. I have loved and hated everyone at different points in the story. The best part of this show is how it takes you on a journey to show how easy it is to justify doing questionable things, bit by bit, until you are so far away from who you were before. What an incredible show."
10.0,18 May 2021,"The best TV series in history.you definitely should watch it.

And if you haven't watched it yet. Why are you breathing?"
10.0,22 September 2020,I'm out of words. That should be enough for a Review
8.0,6 October 2022,"This is the series I ever wanted to watch.

It's well known for detailing in the story and direction skills and performance of actors.

Very good script executed efficiently and those scenes which give goosebumps are on different dimension.

Starting from the High-school teacher, Walter white to the drug kingpin Heisenberg,the transformation was scripted very well and the things and plans he does are simply amazing.

Even though Chemistry is a key element in this masterpiece, the mind game of walter plays very well.

Newness in filmmaking and scripting, New unseen scenes are key elements for the success of this story.

All actors are superb and more than one characters are given importancea and have separate fan base.

Negative thing about this is, It doesn't attract all type of audience suddenly into the screen and sometime it feels slow."
10.0,28 July 2020,"""No TV series can have a perfect ending"" Vince Gillian: ""Hold my beer"" this is really the most well thought, magnificent masterpiece's of TV history and no one can argue with me there, a series that just gets better and better throughout each series which really isn't that common... This is a definite 10/10 and the ratings really speak for itself and that last season is a work of art. 100% Watch this series it will not disappoint."
10.0,1 December 2020,"It's a damn good series , it's the best series it's have ever seen. Everyone must watch this ."
10.0,23 May 2020,I was about a decade late to the party when I finally got around to watching this. Daaaamn this show may be the best out there. The wife drove me nuts but you'll have that. The character development and build up of the storyline is amazing and heartbreaking. This is an awesome show and I love every single person involved in it. Worth the time investment
9.0,14 July 2015,
10.0,4 July 2020,"No matter how good a show I have come across, there's always this one moment of epiphany, when somehow everything just clicks into place. It is usually fabulous and makes you gaze in awe just as the ""directed by .."" floats up on your screen. But months later when you recall it, it tends to seem a bit too much - maybe even otherworldly. Breaking Bad circumvents this pit.

Of course, the highlight of this show is character development - all of them take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, which should be relatable to a large number of middle class families. And it is executed to perfection. There's not this one morning that the protagonist wakes up and decides to do something that will take the world around him by storm. So try to be patient, and it will pay dividends.

Great storytelling and direction still require a stellar cast, and boy did they act their selves out. It's hard to single out a name, to mention only Bryan Cranston would be a huge disrespect to all the others.

I'll remember this one for a long time - it's a gem."
10.0,1 December 2020,"Breaking Bad is that once-in-a-millennium show where everything is elite, acting, the storyline, the music, the cinematography all fire on all four cylinders.

Excellent character development with interspersed jawdropping moments throughout that feel completely earned, and an ending that ties up everything.

From start to end, Breaking Bad is focused and knows what it wants to do and does it to perfection.

The greatest show of all time me, even surpassing The Sopranos."
10.0,24 May 2020,"I guess by watching breaking bad I'm that much more different person. Storyline, directions and actors together made this series uncountable with others ..."
9.0,1 December 2020,"The answer is no. Breaking bad is one of the only shows that has no bad season , no bad plot line , and it is the most rewatchable tv show out there. I have rewatched it 3 times and counting."
10.0,4 October 2012,"You are lucky if you haven't seen Breaking Bad because what a treat you have in store!!! The acting is exceptional, the characters are intriguing to say the least, the story line is believable, and every single episode will leave you wanting to see more and more! I am a very picky viewer when it comes to movies and television shows and I hardly ever find myself addicted to a television show so I feel like if I love it then chances are pretty high that you will love it too! So go to Netflix or ITunes or Amazon, or wherever you go to watch television and sit back and enjoy one of the best shows you'll ever ever see! I really am envious of people who have yet to see Breaking Bad as silly as that sounds! But even though I have seen every episode I still am able to very much enjoy re-watching all six seasons. Enjoy!!!"
10.0,21 October 2012,"I wasn't sure it was ever gonna happen (and especially not so quickly)but i think i've found a show that challenges Dexter.

Breaking Bad is pure and simply engrossing television, that actually improves as the story evolves and the seasons pile up.What really does it for me is the emotions which this show evokes in me. One minute i'm rooting for someone, the next minute i want them dead!! It feels like a sporting event at times. Never have i had this sustained response to a show.I do actually prefer watching the aforementioned Dexter, but for uniqueness this is just pure head and shoulders..Maybe tonight is the night? Maybe it would be easier if we just, cook.."
10.0,23 May 2020,"I guess I'm the latest fan of this series watched 4 season's so far. Amazing casting, screen play and direction. I guess this has been a guiding scale for most of the web Series. Opening and closing of each character was so well defined like old movies nothing was left middle way and I can notice a gradual improvement in quality of the camera skills."
10.0,16 August 2013,"Near the very end of this TV show, it is not hard to conclude that this is for sure the best crime drama series ever made for TV. There is however few more, but as a real life drama it is the best. Other memorable and legendary TV shows is for sure ""The Sopranos"", but it is more oriented on fictional mafia style. The storyline of Breaking Bad which is very unpredictable, yet follows very clear path of ordinary man entering dark side of the crime, and the consequences that comes with it feels real and unusual for TV show. The photography of the sceneries, the time lapse in scenes are unique, as well is more than few times camera work in unusual way. The score tempo and sound of it brings tense and is in the great rhythm with the plot, all the way through series (especially season 4). Soundtrack here is less important, but the rhythm of the scores, which is unbeatable is creepy and unique. Everything looks more like high quality movie than TV show. Actors brings excellent acting, and are very involving. So much can be said, so much more, but in short, this is the one great TV show that is worth to have in own collection. What is interesting, the series did not fall down going through seasons, but becomes better. Fort me personally seasons 3, 4 & 5 looks the best. Making reruns is not boring but something very interesting to discover what we might miss in vast of details this series brings, and it is fun to re watch how this shy ordinary man becomes dangerous villain."
10.0,29 January 2021,Don't mess with a family man he may be the best Don you never imagined.
10.0,2 August 2020,Awesomeness level infinity. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul looks are fucking amazing . Bestest series in the World

10.0,15 May 2021,"DON'T watch this show...because if you will, you won't like any other show ever again! Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever made! Period."
10.0,3 June 2021,"Slow Start but ends like masterpiece! Superb acting and story. Including the Direction and the way this show is written, everything is just perfect. One of the best shows in television history!"
10.0,26 February 2022,"Very very few TV dramas come close. This is the best. It's a story about something I have no interest in, set in a country i've no desire to visit, amongst people I don't partricularly don't want to know, in a culture that I've not experienced. Yet it demands attention for every second, from the pants flying through the air and breathless RV desert mayhem, all the way to the bitter end. The extraordinary writing and wonderful performances make this something extra special. Human frailty. Human values. It's breathtaking television. I've watched the whole thing many, many times. If you've not seen it, you need to."
10.0,1 January 2014,
10.0,29 May 2020,"I compare other series by considering Breaking Bad as benchmarking. If they get close to it, they're good (so far, none was that incredible)."
10.0,5 July 2020,Make sure that this show will be the last you watch. Because this make every other show look decent at best.
10.0,28 May 2020,"I watched this series two times and also the El Camino movie. If the first episodes will make you fall asleep, just give it a chance. In the end, you'll get super addicted to Breaking Bad. A good story with very good actors!"
10.0,23 October 2015,"Breaking Bad The TV series ""Breaking Bad"", created by Vince Gilligan, is about the chemistry teacher Walter White (Bryan Cranston) who contracted cancer. Knowing that he would leave his wife and his children behind with a huge mountain of debts, he decided to get on the business of meth cooking. Together with his partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), they get into lots of trouble that come to a head when Walter's brother-in-law, the DEA-agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), finds out their second identity. I usually prefer other types of series like HIMYM and others. But when I started with the first episode, it immediately attracted me in a way that I always had to watch the following episode. It might seems that there are some repetitive moments, but it's still great to see how they solve all these problems and how much expression the actors can bring into all the different scenes."
10.0,14 January 2021,"It's the best series I've seen in my life, the story of this series is a very good one,and the action is wide and full of suspense, maybe some people don't like the ending, but i liked it. I recommend the series!"
10.0,30 November 2020,"The premise of ""Breaking Bad"" is about a man determined to make meth to protect his family before he dies of a terminal illness. This premise seems utterly insane for most people to contemplate when they start watching this series, but when you've reached it's inevitable dark conclusion, it will completely make sense.

Breaking Bad liberally borrows themes from other crime movies, like ""The Godfather"". The importance of protecting family features prominently, but ""Breaking Bad"" has it's own twist of ""Scarface"" mixed up in it's philosophy (even referencing it directly in a scene). Yet ""Breaking Bad"" reaches it's own conclusion, and it is it's own animal - never aping it's own inspirations.

Breaking Bad also acts as an indictment of modern America. When health insurance is so expensive how could this not force people into desperate situations? And laid against the historical backdrop of New Mexico, why does America glamorize it's criminals? Additionally, how does one deal with moral, spiritual, and ethical decisions when it's really only the objective rule of law that matters?

""Breaking Bad"" is not only thematically deep, but it's acting and characterizations are fantastic. There are many dark, shocking plot twists and edge-of-your-seat scenes which land impactful and unforgettable blows on the viewer. Without doubt this is great stuff and incredibly well written. Like the addictive pure meth produced by Walter White, you will be gripped to your chair until you have reached it's conclusion."

10.0,31 May 2020,"What can i say about Breaking Bad? Pure perfection. Just like Heisenberg's meth. Breaking Bad is unmatchable. Vince Gilligan and the writers are geniuses. All seasons are untouchable and gold. But my personal favourite would be Season 5.

Characters can't get any better. The acting is magnificent. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are the perfect duo. Finished BrBa about 2 months ago and i miss it.

The greatest TV Show of all time. For me it's the greatest thing to come out of the film industry."
8.0,31 May 2014,"If I could I would have given 11 out of 10 since this TV series is so well made that few others series could have been as much entertaining as this one. As a matter of fact Breaking Bad has everything: irony, especially in the first two series the relationship and the situations between Jessie and Walter are amusing, besides some particular characters as Hank and Saul Goodman; the plot is very well developed and compelling since the beginning and in the 4th and 5th series there's a continuous climax and the story line takes an unexpected turn; the characters are psychologically studied in depth through their change from the 1st to the last season; the actors are all great, but Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul deserve a special mention."
10.0,18 May 2020,Damn I love this series. One of the best show ever watched
10.0,10 June 2021,"It has been some years since I watched Breaking Bad. For no particular reason I started rewatching some clips on Youtube.

Just wow, rewatching some of the notable scenes comes off so iconic and just perfectly done. Besides of giving you that sweet nostalgia, you realize every single detail and purpose that Vince Gilligan put into the various scenes and you can thoroughly relate that to the entire show meaningfully. Truly a mastermind."
10.0,9 July 2020,"I didn't knew about this show until my friend told me to watch it. I watched GOT and when I saw its last season i wasn't satisfied. Anyway, i looked on internet and was shocked to see this shows rating higher than the GOT.

I downloaded it and watched all of the episodes and now I am a fan of this show and GOT now comes on the second position in my TV series favourite lists.

Breaking Bad has everything you need a good protagonist , antagonist and the excellent supporting cast followed by the brilliant background music and a fantastic ending. This show is just a complete package and was able to hold me till its last episode.

A must watch show for everyone."
10.0,21 June 2020,"You can't find a better series. Just see it, now. It's like a whole life, the whole package is 10/10"
10.0,10 January 2016,To be honest i was not so fond of this show when i started it. I watched the last episode before i finished the first. Everyone was telling me that it was such a good show and that i should keep watching it. So i continued and i fell in love with the show. I watched it a year ago completely and now i am watching it again. The characters are so good and the plot is amazing. This is the best show i have ever seen and i don't think there will ever be a show that will be as good as this one. The first two seasons were not the best but it starts to get really good at the end of the second season. I watched 17 hours of this show in 2 days thats how good it is. If you have not seen this show i suggest you watch it immediately.
10.0,30 May 2021,Everything has ended with this TV show. Unrepeatable work!
10.0,12 November 2013,"I took me a long time to jump on the Breaking Bad hype; I had tried it about a year ago and did not get past episode one. I thought it was slow and boring. However, after all the talk on the internet (imgur, reddit etc) I gave it another try. It is very hard for me to put into words how I feel about this show. Yes, the first series is slow and the action is sparse; but that is life I guess. The writers are trying to tell a real life story about an ordinary person turning to crime.

As the series go by, The action picks up speed and more and more you find yourself on the edge of your seat. I am not one to shout at my TV, but I found myself so often screaming at the TV in sheer amazement. This show draws you in; it emotionally hooks you up to the characters and you are on this ride with them.

Now that it has finished (And just to mention, BB, unlike *many* other TV shows, triumphs with it's ending) I am in two minds. I would absolutely love it to carry on, but I am also glad it finished. There are some shows that just have to finish, and others that just carry on for the sake of making money. BB had it's time and knew when it was done. It was not drug out, it wrapped itself up neatly and put itself on the shelf."
10.0,12 September 2014,"Definitely my all time favorite TV-series. It's all you want composed in to one show, it's tragic, extremely full of suspense, has a great plot and is full of dark humor. The characters are spot on, everyone really suits their character and I feel like the show in general is just really raw. If a character feels like crap they look like crap, so there's no excessive make-up and expensive houses, it's just realistic and that makes it so much better as it's easier for the viewer to relate even if the story isn't something anyone relates to at all unless you're Walter White. It's just these small things that you see yourself or someone you know in, because most of what's in this show is things that could happen in real life, which you don't see very often in TV-series.

I've probably recommended Breaking Bad to everyone I know, and I will continue to do so. Everyone who hasn't watched it has missed something exceptionally great. It kind of ruins your hope of ever finding one of those flawless shows that you just can't stop watching, because nothing is as good as Breaking Bad. You need it in your life.

Watch it, you will not regret it."
10.0,1 January 2016,"Breaking Bad displays perfection in every way possible. From the memorable multi- dimensional characters portrayed with excellent acting to the brilliant plot that is thoughtfully constructed so that every season, episode and second fits together perfectly. It's for any audience, from the analytical minded who consider all of the underlying messages, to the people who just want to watch a good story. While watching, it's impossible for anyone to not acknowledge the genius that comes from the makers of this show. To this day I haven't seen a better TV show and I really don't believe I'll ever see one better than this Breaking Bad"

9.0,21 September 2020,"I have never seen such a TV series in my life, it remains the best series among which I have watched, I have never forwarded even single second in 62 episodes, I have even watched few episodes again randomly as a recap to recall some memories how it went through these 62 episodes. I liked the Walt's character, and Hank was humorous most of the time, Saul also acted very well, almost all the characters in this series were best at their acting. It gave me a feeling that I was involved in it and made me emotional at times, and thrilled and lot more, one can never be upset or disappointed by watching this series. It creates a nostalgic about it, every day you wonder how did you end up watching it, and even expect more to watch from that series, you'll never believe that it just concluded this way, if you watched it late then you'll have a feeling why didn't I watched it earlier. May be no one could ever make another such series of quality acting and script. Hats off to the entire team who have worked on this. I just can't finish of writing this review by writing few words those are not enough always my mind doesn't satisfy how much I can tell you about it. Who didn't have watched it yet, you are never late and this series never gets old and one can watch at any stage of their life."

I challenge you to find a better, all-round series that exists to-date. Simply Brilliant. Not sure many people will get round to seeing my brief review, there's only one thing to say, go watch this if you haven't already.

Everything about it is near perfection and that's the highest praise I can give, as nothing nor nobody is perfect."
8.0,24 May 2020,The best that I have ever watched in my entire life. Words cannot describe the series. Watch it and won't regret it that's my promise.
10.0,14 June 2020,"A few weeks ago, if you had told me that BB is better than GOT, I would have probably laughed. Or even thought you are mad. It is funny how perspectives change with time. My long pending desire to watch the show came to an end a month ago. And just yesterday, I completed the entire series.

What a terrific acting performance from the cast. Be it Bryan Cranston or Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, or Dean Norris. As I am not an expert on acting, I am not going to delve deeper into it.

My favorite part of the series is the storytelling part. Vince Gilligan is a master. he has proven it with this series. from the very beginning to the end of the series, there was not an instance of boredom. For a guy who gets easily bored like me, this was surprising. If you want to know how to write stories for a movie, this show is the academy of it. You can learn flashforward tricks, foreshadowing, and many more such things.

I wouldn't be surprised if 20 years from now, teenagers speak highly about this show. so addictive it is that I feel like I lost something when the show ended. I didn't feel this way even when my favorite show game of thrones ended. Now it is time for me to cope up with the BB hangover."
10.0,13 August 2021,"Breaking Bad is the greatest piece of art I've ever seen! If you love cinema and film, this show will bring you on a journey that no other show will give you. You see amazing characters grow into even more sophisticated characters. You find yourself not knowing who to cheer for. You'll be on the edge of your the throughout the entire show and the ending will not be a disappointment. Every thing that you want to happed will! I'll go out saying this about the show....it's outstanding!!"
10.0,25 November 2013,"This is the best show i ever saw! It is the most intense thing i have ever seen. I am always excited for the next episode. I am involved in the show in entirely. It is also completely original. Brian Cranston does a great job as Walter White and couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. The same goes for Aaron Paul ( as Jesse Pinkman). All of the Acting choices are perfect. The writing is just phenomenal! As I said, it is very intense, and it will leave you white-knuckled the entire series. I was very disappointing when the series ended because it has come such a long way since the first episode. I've had an awesome journey , and I am very thankful for Vince Gilligan for being so creative."
10.0,1 December 2020,"This show is just incredible in SO many ways, and If I even say one good thing about this show out of a million others, I would be ranting about it for days, it's just so good and I'ts one of those shows that you cant believe how good it is unless you see it for yourself.

10.0,31 December 2021,"The slow pace of the show might intimidate the average watcher but it slowly progresses to arguably the best show of all time. Literally everything is near perfection; the villains, the acting, the character progression, the camera work, etc. Etc. Etc. Vince Gilligan made a program that would never fail the test of time and will keep being iconic forever. I have nothing else to add, amazing.

10.0,29 October 2010,"AMC has proved over the last three or four years that they have the most provocative shows on television. They have controlled the Emmy wins in the drama category, letting the Big Four know that they can hold their own on the battlefield too. This is all due to their two big shows, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the latter of which is currently my favorite show on television. Breaking Bad stars Bryan Cranston of Malcolm in the Middle fame and Aaron Paul, as Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, respectively. Bryan Cranston has won three straight Emmys (all three years the show has aired) for Best Actor in a Drama, while Aaron Paul finally won the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Emmy this past year.

The series follows Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, who in the first episode of the show is diagnosed with lung cancer. Once his initial shock has passed, Walter realizes that he needs to provide for his family when he is gone. While at his 50th birthday party, Walter's DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank (played by the wonderful Dean Norris), turns on the news in time for everyone to witness him bust a methamphetamines lab. Walt sees the amount of money involved and proceeds to go on a ride along with Hank. While Hank is busting another meth lab, Walt waits in the car and witnesses one of the drug dealers escaping. They make eye contact and Walt recognizes Jesse Pinkman, a former student, as the escaping dealer. He later goes to Jesse's house, where they begin a partnership which becomes the focus of the series.

There is not a weak link to be found in any part of this series. Never have I been so stunned by a television series as when I first watched Breaking Bad. The writing, directing, editing, music, acting I could go on and on. Vince Gilligan, the creator and frequent writer and director, had such a unique vision for this series, and it is exemplified throughout the show. The writing creates a sense of tension which is escalated by the superb acting that each cast member brings to the table. Bryan Cranston does not just portray Walter White; he is Walter White. It's stunning to see such performances from Malcolm's father. At its core, this is truly a story about a man's battle with cancer, and you see Bryan portray a sad indifference about his situation. He makes such a turn as a character that you almost wouldn't recognize Walter in the first episode as the same Walter in later seasons. He becomes so complacent with his condition that he takes risks he normally wouldn't and constantly shows us at every turn, that he is truly at peace and ready to die.

The supporting characters have just as much acting chops as Bryan Cranston, too. Aaron Paul gives an incredible presentation as a meth dealing drug addict. He makes you think he has nothing to live for and nothing to care about and then at times will show you that he really still is a little boy at heart. Anna Gunn plays Walt's pregnant wife, Skyler, showing us a concerned spouse, already mourning her husband before he is gone. As her suspicion builds as to what Walt could be up to during the endless amount of hours he spends away from his family, she begins to care less about her husband's condition and more about why he isn't spending his last days with his family. Dean Norris plays Hank, the DEA agent brother-in-law, who Walt spends a lot of time avoiding due to his newfound drug selling. Hank plays a great supporting character, hunting down a drug lord, who unbeknownst to him is in fact his brother-in-law, Walt. He becomes an even better character in the second season when he gets a real story arc of his own. RJ Mitte plays Walt's son, Walter Jr., a teenager who is afflicted with cerebral palsy. He is the most distraught about his father's condition and has some great emotional scenes, especially during the arc where Walt is deciding whether or not he wants to go through treatment. Last but not least is Marie, Hank's wife and Skyler's sister, played by Betsy Brandt. She is easily the most transparent of all the characters, mostly merely playing supportive wife and/or sister.

In conclusion, watch this show. If you have ever watched anything on television, you will like it. Hell, if you have never seen a television in your life, you will still fall in love with this show. The character development that results from Walt's cancer diagnosis is equally matched by the plot twists thrown at you each episode. This is a show to best all other shows and it is truly the greatest television show I have ever watched."
10.0,23 November 2020,"Just finished watching the entirety of Breaking Bad for the fourth time, having never watched any series more than twice before. The brilliance of this show is the rollercoaster relationship between Walter and Jesse, which ranges from a proud fatherly/son bond to pure hatred, and also of the downtrodden man/husband becoming someone that others look up to or are afraid of. Every time I've watched it I've spotted something new. I'd suggest if anyone has watched it before and is thinking of watching it again then to look up online the many 'Easter Eggs' that Vince Gilligan put into the show. These demonstrate the level of intelligence that went onto the show."
10.0,28 May 2021,THE best show ever made. I remember episode 1 like it was yesterday... The emotional roller-coaster this show takes you through is like a high you'll NEVER reach again. Every episode kept you on the edge of your seat. Bravo to all the actors!

Aaron Paul is really a great actor,wow what a piece of art Breaking Bad is!!!"
10.0,23 May 2020,"I just finished the show, i feel like i miss it already, i mean I've been so obsessed with Mr. White, and Jessi 💔 i can see them in my dream. And now i finshed the show and m shocked so shocked like i miss someone who i really love, i can't help it i feel so bad."
10.0,29 July 2020,"What can i say? an iconic how with tons of great characters, cinematography, music, and great consistency. i think people are quick to judge the show based on the summary-i know i did. i thought the show would be overly edgy and romanticize substance abuse and violence, but this show handles these sensitive topics with much grace. seriously, i though this show would be way grosser and i guess dude bro-y, but it really wasn't-however if you're into the super gritty stuff there definitely is a lot of that so it's great for fans of that kind of stuff. it's just the way the show handles these topics that's pretty admirable. without spoilers, this is overall a fantastic show with one of the most perfect and most satisfying endings ever. could not recommend it enough, unless you're like twelve, in which case wait a couple years, but still definitely give it a watch once you're older."
10.0,23 August 2020,"I just loved this entire series. Nit was very well casted, directed, written and filmed, and on top of that it had ZERO liberal bias or agenda. Truly refreshing, wish there were lots more like this gem, but there are not in the day and age. Check it out, amazing crime drama that just shines. What the sequel short as well, I believe it's called El Camino."

10.0,20 June 2024,"I guess everybody knows the premise, a school teacher whom discovered his got cancer need to make and sell drugs to pay his treatment.

As chemist, he cooks the best metanfetamina in the market, the blue crystal.

That's very nice, but, like ALWAYS, it should finish early, should never go more than 4 seasons and they did.

Some characters are dull, it's impossible what kind of relationship with the wife ( she is the most annoying person), and the brother in law, how come he didn't get what's happening?

Yeah, the show is fine, well acted, nice edit but is overrated, not the best show ever, even not top 10.

But I still recommend it."

9.0,9 March 2021,"I think Breaking Bad is the best TV show with good characters and an amazing and thrilling plot. Breaking Bad was released in 2008 with 5 seasons and 62 episodes. The series was created by Vince Gilligan and directed by Mark Johnson in the USA. The series actors are Bryan Cranston as Walter White, Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman and Anna Gunn as Skyler White. The story is set in New Mexico to Albuquerque about a ex chemestry teacher with a former student produces a drug, the crystal meth to try to live longer.

10.0,26 April 2010,"After Deadwood came to a close I pretty much decided there was no need to keep my television. Only the Dynamic Duo of Stewart and Colbert saved it. Then came Breaking Bad; or what I call 'life after Deadwood'. There is no need for me to wax on about this series. All the fans already know, and anyone with even reasonable taste who happens to stumble across an episode will immediately recognize the quality of the writing, performing, directing, lighting and whatever else it takes to create such a classic series. When I saw first Brian Cranston playing the father I thought the series was doomed. I only knew the guy from Malcolm, where he was entertaining and displayed excellent comic chops but, hey what did I know? I have never been so happy to be revealed as clueless. Cranston is amazing. His metamorphosis from passive aggressive husband/father to hardcore meth God is the meat of the series. But everyone is excellent. My only complaint has been in the last season. The cartel assassins are a little bigger than life, IMO, and it sort of changes the tone of the show. But that's a minor complaint. Others have already written plenty about this show, and much better than I could. So I'll leave the in depth analysis to the pros and close by simply saying 'watch it!'. ""Best show on television"" is not hyperbole."

But other than that, the characters and the brilliant acting not to mention the REALISM, everything is so detailed and right to the touch!"

10.0,11 March 2021,". . . see if you can bypass the now sped-up load time to ""next episode"" on this one. (It used to be queued pretty well, but that's no longer the case atm.) Let the credits play awhile. I'm not one to notice music scoring, but this show has upped my viewing game. The pause from episode to episode is very necessary. (2 cents)

What's left to be said? Best show ever? Check. Sleeper hit still storming the barn after thirteen years? Double check.

For any of you ambivalent about watching (I know a few of you are still out there), forget the premise, forget the material, give it to the end of the first episode.

(FTR, I don't think ""storming the barn"" is an actual thing, but I'm going to plead ""Pinkman"".)"
10.0,11 March 2021,Best show i've ever seen. Best piece of cinema i've ever seen. You should watch it.
10.0,30 June 2013,"My brother, a year or two back, started watching Breaking Bad. Having heard a lot about it, and wanting to know what was keeping him glued to his computer screen, I watched the Pilot one day. And I was blown away.

Before Breaking Bad, I hadn't seen very much television. When I heard of the premise, I immediately thought that it would be about the character becoming a drug dealer, and his many different drug deals. Kind of like a procedural. But, when I was watching the first season, I was confused. Each episode flowed into the next, telling a story. It wasn't like other shows that had a case of the week. It was special.

I proceeded to watch the first two and a half seasons, and then it was summer. I went to camp that summer, as the first half of season 5 was being released on TV. All the time, I was anxiously awaiting when I could go home and finish watching Breaking Bad. So, when I got home, I finished all that exists thus far of Breaking Bad.

This was my first foray into truly excellent, serialized television. What I loved the most was that it was a gripping series, full of subtle nuances that made it above average. For example, the teases during the second season that foreshadow the climactic ending of Season Two, or the excellent opening of Season Three. I could go on. It was surreal to see these images that translated into poetry, even through the darkness of Walter White.

Speaking about Walter White, I still think that he is the greatest television character of all time. Some say that Tony Soprano is the greatest, or Don Draper, or whomever else; but Walter White stands above the rest. His descent into Heisenberg is eerily perfect, played to the finest detail by Bryan Cranston. It's the best part of the show.

Really, to understand Breaking Bad, you have to watch it. It's the only way to understand the genius behind it. I will be honest, I haven't YET seen The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, or Dexter (other supposedly excellent shows), but I feel that they won't ever aspire to the greatness of Breaking Bad, yo."
10.0,7 January 2014,"The perfect series! I just discovered this whole mind blowing thing one year ago, but it hooked me in right after the pilot already. So I watched it 24/7 because I wanted to finish with it until the date of the series finale. I was even faster and I had the opportunity to watch the very last five episodes in time... Amazing story, magnificent acting, tremendous music. Everything in its right place. If you want to see only one series, I recommend to start with this. But you will be in danger, because you won't find another series until you finished watching Breaking Bad... Before I discovered BB, Dexter was my favorite, but they totally screwed up with the last season so I went awfully disappointed about it."
10.0,24 February 2021,"I just finished breaking bad yesterday and I feel myself feeling sad it's over. The show had everything. Comedy, action, drama, great characters and so on. Everything was just perfect. So many people recommended this show to me for awhile, but I usually am not a big TV show guy especially when it came out years ago. I got hooked on this show and couldn't get enough. Every episode is good and builds something for the future. I could go on for hours saying how good everything was, but I won't. Please watch this show. It's just perfection."
10.0,19 May 2021,It's just awesome to see the the transformation of Walter White to Heisenberg. Later his death was painfull because it was the ending of the series.
10.0,15 October 2013,"It is funny when you think back on 'Breaking Bad's early days and how they contrast with the way it is now. For its first two seasons, it was largely a cult show outside the U.S., featuring a fanbase that was passionate but not exactly huge. It was even dropped from UK TV due to poor ratings, never to be picked up again. However, around the time the third season premiered, its popularity began to rise, increasing with each subsequent season, thanks to word-of-mouth, reaching a pinnacle with the fifth season becoming the most-talked-about television series of 2013, as large numbers of people starting catching up with the show. This is undoubtedly due to the quality of the series – it is absolutely brilliant. The current success of it can be seen through three recent achievements – it entered The Guinness World Book of Records for being the best-reviewed TV show ever, the Writers Guild of America listed it as one of the great TV series ever written and it also walked away with the top prize at this year's Emmys (and chances are, may do next year as well).

One aspect of the series that no one can dispute is the brilliance of its cast. Thanks to Walter White, Bryan Cranston is no longer ""that guy who played the dad in Malcolm in the Middle"" and has deservedly won three Emmys for his role as Walt because like the show, he is fantastic, especially as he conveys his character's development from being ""Mr. Chips"" to ""Scarface"", as creator Vince Gilligan once remarked in his pitch for the series. Meanwhile, Aaron Paul is superb as Jesse, perfectly capturing a range of sides to his character, from being naive to mature to stubborn to introspective. Aside from the concept of how an ordinary man change transform into an entirely different person, at the very heart of 'Breaking Bad' is the tumultuous relationship between Walt and Jesse. It goes up and down like a roller-coaster, yet it gives the show heart even as the pair do desperate things and we, as viewers, can't helped but be deeply engaged with them, as they argue, confide, fight and of course, cook.

However, the other cast members are just as good as the two leads. As crime scene cleaner Mike Ehrmantraut, Jonathan Banks is outstanding (he should've won that Emmy) and Dean Norris is terrific with strong screen presence as Walt's DEA brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. While Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte are both great as Walt's wife and son, as they form a family relationship with Cranston that is never anything but realistic considering the situations he places them in, even if Gunn's character is not the most likable. Bob Odenkirk is a pleasure to watch as Walt and Jesse's metaphor-loving lawyer Saul Goodman, providing some comic relief, especially whenever his bodyguard Huell Babineaux (Lavell Crawford) is around. Special mention should be given to Giancarlo Esposito, who is mesmerising as Gus Fring, the owner of fast food chain, Los Pollos Hermanos.

'Breaking Bad' is one of those series where every episode leaves wanting you more, especially with a number of incredible cliffhangers that Gilligan has left viewers dangling on – without spoiling anything, the season five mid-way cliffhanger left me (and many others) desperate to find out what would happen next. It has grown progressively darker over the course of its five seasons, starting out as a black comedy before slowly (and understandably) morphing into something deeper and more serious, while still retaining moments of humour. Similarly, it has also grown increasingly good over its five seasons, being excellent at first before becoming incredible; with the recently-aired fifth season the best of the lot (some of the greatest episodes in the entire series are a few near the end). The key to this show's success is Gilligan, the very man who created it, who has written and directed a multitude of episodes and always manages to brilliantly place the characters in disastrous situations. The quality of the writing, acting and directing (with a special mention to Rian Johnson) on display here is exemplary and on a level that is rarely equalled. If you haven't seen this truly masterful series yet, then you know what you need to do and if you have seen it all, I can't imagine any reason why you wouldn't want to go back and watch it all over again. I know I will."
10.0,19 May 2021,"I have watched a lot of series and enjoyed many of them .However, When I finished watched Breaking Bad, I felt like I am a new person. It is literally a masterpiece. I wish I could erase it from my memory just to watch and enjoy it again !"
10.0,21 December 2013,"There are very few TV shows that I get so engrossed in that I can't stop watching it. Breaking Bad is one of them

Never before have I watched a series that is done as well as this one. It has unexpected plot twists and unforeseen events that you could never guess. Very rarely is a TV show so brilliant and done so well. I would strongly recommend watching Breaking Bad!! It is a perfect, and I mean perfect blend of action and drama that will make you get addicted to it like nothing else. It has clif hangers that will leave you so speechless the only thing you will be able to do is watch the next episode. If you haven't started watching Breaking Bad yet, you should, you have no idea what you're missing."
9.0,29 May 2020,"After rewatching this series with a friend, the first season comes across as very dull with a low budget. It's slow and meandering and my friend had a hard time maintaining interest. The second season gets better and by season 3 and 4 it's become bingeable with us watching several shows back to back. The ending could have been written a few different ways and it has a nice finish as shown. El Camino is the follow up movie and mostly just extends the show with attempts to wrap a few things up."
10.0,24 May 2020,"We see many series now which starts off well then dies in following season, but with Breaking Bad, it just gets better with following season. Bryan Cranston and Aaraon Paul were just brilliant in this.

Thrilling story line, keeping you glued till season 5 without loosing momentum is really commendable. Very well done, Breaking Bad."

10.0,20 January 2014,"What to say about this series...every single word is truly less to describe how good is Breaking Bad. Hats off to Vince Gilligan for creating such a masterpiece series.The actors were extremely superb. Bryan Cranston was awesome as Mr. White. Aaron Paul was quite a big surprise.His role keeps growing more and more intense,funnier,loving and he really done a fantastic work.Now talking about all the seasons... It started great in the first and a bit slow in the second may be its the story demands...but it keeps surprising us all.The Ending Was Fantastic.Actually You will never get bored except some moments. One cannot predict whats going to happen next. All the characters starting Mr. and Mrs white,Flynn,Hank,Marie,Drug Cartel,Gus,Mike and all played excellent and Honestly made their characters real and outstanding. Actually i am falling out of Adjectives here to show my deep regards and respect to this show and its whole cast and crew. Its A benchmark to the TV Serials. A must watch for all... Its really Good to see Breaking Bad"

10.0,8 January 2015,"This was one series that continued to get better each season. Bryan Cranston was great in the lead role. Fantastic show, great writers. The story follows in a logical way that would be believable if it were to actually happen. The supporting cast around Cranston was very good, and the list of actors brought in throughout the seasons added to the show, without many distractions. Sal the lawyer was always a pleasure to watch, and he added some humor while still retaining a character that seemed to fit in with the drama going on around him. Aaron Paul played the perfect accomplice. Everyone actually performed very well throughout the entire series. Jonathon Banks, Dean Morris, and Giancarlo Esposito really stood out also."

10.0,14 August 2012,"The reader's opinions are spot on. But, all viewers need to accept that 'Breaking Bad' is pure entertainment ... not a morality play or the balance of good over evil. Greed, avarice, and moral voids are part of all human life. That, in itself, is what makes this one of the best (if not the best) of American crime series in the 21st Century. Just as Forbrydelsen (Danish) and The Killing plowed new fields, so is 'Breaking Bad'. Breaking bad - Especially our ongoing 'war on drugs' adds a special cachet to the stories. All future US crime / drug / action / justice - including crime and punishment genres will be judged by this marvelous series. Wonderful ... we will not miss one episode ... and we live in Asia. We love it. Better than 'The Wire,' 'The Shield,' or The Sopranos. We can only hope that they find a way to extend the show for another season. Excellente!"

10.0,1 February 2021,"Best show ever written, no contest. No other show even comes close. I've never seen a show as many times as I've seen Breaking Bad. I've even watched the series 3 times in a row consecutively before"
10.0,11 September 2014,"If there is one show which has absolutely no flaws throughout the series, it has to be Breaking Bad. The show just kept on improving from earlier seasons. 2nd was better than 1st, 3rd than 2nd, 4th than 3rd and 5th was the ultimatum. Nevertheless, all the seasons were just mind blowing. I loved the transformation of Walter White in to Heisenberg. The same guy who thought $737,000 was what enough to support his family after he is gone, even millions couldn't cater his thirst. The scene in which he says ""Just, say my Name"" in S5 just gave me goose bumps even for a second viewing. Each and every character in the series was there for a reason and each of them had their presence felt. That's what is magnificent about the series. Casting is brilliant and acting is top notch. I don't think there is any other actor who could portray Walter White as Bryan Cranston did. Hands down!!

I strongly recommend it."
10.0,27 February 2015,"I could write a ridiculously long review explaining the ins and outs of this series. Telling you all what makes it so good and evaluating each character and each episode with incredible detail, but I'm not going to do that.

What I'm going to do instead, is tell you that I love TV and film. I've watched thousands of different films and I have watched many, many TV series too. So when I say that Breaking Bad is, by an absolute mile, the greatest thing I have ever watched, I want you to take that very seriously. I have spent the past hour or so trying to think of one single flaw, one single bad thing about Breaking Bad and I cannot think of anything. I cannot explain to you how fantastic this series is, in every way imaginable. The acting, the camera-work, the soundtracks, the scripting, the makeup, everything.

I am a hard guy to please in terms of TV and film, and I'm not just saying that, I truly am. I always manage to find at least one negative point in everything, at least one thing where a film or series can improve, but Breaking Bad is as close to perfection as you are ever going to see. If you haven't watched it for whatever reason, I beg you, please watch this series. Ignore all the people who say it is ""overrated"" or ""boring"", because they really are clueless, or just looking to cause an argument.

Please, please, please watch Breaking Bad. I cannot put into words how amazing it is. There aren't enough adjectives in the English language to describe it. It is simply, perfect."
10.0,8 May 2020,"To be frank, I felt the show was not more than average after the first 3 seasons. But just after watching the last 3-4 episodes of season 4, I found it interesting. And season 5 was much better and didn't disappoint me and i hope it doesn't disappoint you either. The fact that I didn't find the first 3 seasons interesting was the story was kinda running slow and there wasn't much progress in the story and it was just beating around the bush too much. But after season 4 ,I realized that the first 3 were also ,in fact good which I didn't realize at that time. This was really very much closer to reality as it showed that a man would go any far for his family. The ending was satisfying unlike other popular TV shows. This show has most of the elements covered like crime,action,somewhat-intermediate-comedy,emotions,most of which reality was important and preserved."
10.0,19 May 2021,"Without a doubt. My only wish is that they kept going, I understand why they ended when they did, but that team could have pulled over another few seasons. The ending just felt a tad rushed."
9.0,4 January 2014,"What can I say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said? It's easily one of the most addictive shows ever to come on air, and that's mainly down to the actors. The dialogue written for them and then spoken is flawless, there isn't a line too many in the whole thing. When there's just silence, the reactions by each of the actors to what's going on keeps the whole thing captivating.

Bryan Cranston, who was, before this, mainly just known for the X-Files and Malcolm in the Middle, was perfectly cast, and it's done so well you can easily sympathize with him, but, as it goes on, when he starts to change more and more into Heisenberg, you start to hate him, and Cranston's flawless performance was what made this happen. The rest of the cast are equally good, from the hot-headed Aaron Paul, to the well-meaning but dangerous Dean Norris, to the concerned and independent housewife Anna Gunn.

The music really adds something else to it, using a great selection of songs that just fit the mood of the storyline being told at that time. Although the directors frequently change from episode to episode, the show has a great consistency from the style to the tempo.

As Walter White said at the beginning of season 1, ""Chemistry is the study of change"", we can do nothing but watch as Walter White, a dull high school professor transforms, over the course of 62 episodes, into a ruthless meth cook who tries to explain all his actions with simple excuses. But if you haven't watched it yet, then what's your excuse?"

10.0,2 January 2014,"Iv been hearing very good reviews about braking bad for a while now and seeing 9.5 on IMDb just made me a must watch on my TV shows to be watched list. I was pretty skeptical how would I present this to my wife as she loves to watch TV shows but reading short summary for Braking Bad made me overly cushion in which particular way will I approach to her. And boy did we have a blast on a five season marathon of pure TV show drama at it best :) I must say character developing in braking bad is just about as good as real life can offer. And drama, scripting, directing, casting, acting, music, plot development, twits it offers, wits in decision making, heart breaking moments, and at the end all things breaking bad just makes perfect sense in a world of Walter White and his family. I got a say that Bryan Cranston did outstanding job, performing his guts out making viewers to soak in like water in a sponge. What he did whit a Walter White character is just enormously, gigantic piece of art acting and he deserves to be put in TV shows annals as one of the best character acting of all times. He molds and twists hes charisma to the point that you just cant do better then it is :) And there is Jesse Pinkman - this guy slowly grows on you like a weed in a yard and it sticks whit you all the way to the end - you just cant get rid of him as much as you try - Aaron Paul is outstanding Jesse Pinkman to say the least :) Skyler (Anna Gunn) is beautifully incorporated as Walts beloved wife and she also get the same massive character development as Walt did - all those hard decisions Walt makes trough his career reflects on her as much as crystal clear mirror reflects our on image making us look for what we really are. Of Course, a joyable comedian of the show - Hank Schrader (Dean Norris) will make you feel on a threshold when the right time comes. The main thing, and this is why so many of us are hooked on breaking bad, besides the story, is how well taught and amazingly brilliant all those characters came together to form a master piece, a classic that will dwell in our minds for years to come :) Im absolutely overly stunned about how good this TV show is/was, and because of that Braking Bad is a must for all TV junkies out there - so prepare yourself for a ride of the decade and open your heart for truly amazing drama that will bring all the right emotions in you in just about perfect time. Enjoy!"
10.0,20 January 2014,"I procrastinated watching this show when a friend recommended it and I regret it so much. The show had me hooked from the very first episode. I loved everything from the storyline to the casting and direction.

I think the main thing that interested me is the drastic character development of Walter White and how evil takes over his relatable original character gradually through every season. Even though Walter was my main interest at first I started to favour other characters like Jesse, Hank, Mike and Gus. By the end of the show, I developed a reverence for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as actors.

In my opinion this show is a modern retelling of the book of Job but in this case the suffering inflicts a breaking point on the protagonist and it is thought-provoking when Walter White describes this as being ""awake"". This makes me wonder if everyone has a context where they would ""break bad"" and I don't necessarily mean break the law but their own ethos."
10.0,30 September 2013,"Breaking bad managed to give me a rare, greedy feeling of wanting to watch more and more, but not wanting it to end. Never before have I felt so attached to every character; while at the same time being in total awe of the symbolism, depth, and balance between light comical moments and very dark scenes which have been seamlessly woven into the script.

Looking back on the journey through the lives of the characters in Albuquerque, I cant help but feel a real sense of nostalgia.

Well done to everyone who was involved in the creation of this series. To me this is the greatest television show ever created. This series crosses the boundary between television and fine art."
10.0,20 February 2014,"Yes a bold statement, but trust me I have watched loads of TV shows over the years.

Sopranos, Six feet Under, The Wire, The Shield, BSG, Game of Thrones, you know where I'm going.

Great TV shows all of them, but BB is the show that tops them all. The characters from season 1 to Season 5.2 change and develop so much, more than any show I've watched in the past.

And if you love cliff hanger endings, it seems every episode ends on one.

You've never seen anything like it in your life. An utterly amazing piece of work that has left a massive hole in my life.

You need BB in your life, that's all I'm saying.

PS. One crumb of comfort, Gus is in Revolution!!"

10.0,26 December 2013,"I was at a party last Saturday night and a friend said to me that he was going to get netflix so he can watch Breaking Bad. I thought, fair enough, finally you have come round to the sensible way of watching TV ""on demand"". I did not pay much attention to the watch Breaking Bad bit as was more concerned with having a few beers. The next day with a hangover in tow I was reading a blog post on Nicky Butt following the release of class of 92 (for American friends a documentary film on a group of players who came through the Man Utd youth system which included David Beckham) and he said he was glued to watching Breaking Bad so off I went to Netflix to start my marathon session.

So, you guessed it, I spent Xmas watching Breaking bad but I was battling the man flu, I'm not a sad pointless fool.

From the pilot to the final scene I was hooked like no other show I have seen. Storyline brilliance, superb casting and fantastic direction. What disturbs me more than anything else is the decision making of British TV execs who thought this show was not worthy of a prime time stint. Instead it was relegated to Netflix, which is not at all main stream yet in the UK. Why are us Brits subjected to such reality TV bobbins, when TV shows depicting the real world are shoved aside in this fashion.

Breaking Bad is great for many reasons, but perhaps the most important is its capability to hit home the do or die mentality of American society. A School teacher behaving in such a way is entirely plausible when there is no way out of the over capitalist health care system. While it is truly captivating to watch, as a Brit you always think it is entirely avoidable if the US thought a little differently.

Having said that where would we be without the intrigue of American society, the anything is possible way of life and the shear audacity of it all. You certainly keep us interested America but I do hope you change your health care system. There must be so many Americans who are contemplating drastic actions to survive.

Regardless of my political observations I must stress that this is the best TV show I have ever seen. End of! Perhaps it's the start of even more hard hitting dramas that are free from the corporate chains to communicate anything they like."

I take word of mouth advise seriously so i bought the dvds and OH MY GOD. The show is brilliant, so well written that u wonder what kind of magical brains do the writing. Its funny, the characters are flawed but intelligent, funny but edge-of-the-seat serious. This is a show where there is violence but it also shows the value of a human life like i have never witnessed. This show is a bundle of contradictions that will hook u from the very first episode. I passed the flag my sister passed me and recommended this show on facebook, twitter, bbm and what have you. And its OK if u call in sick because u cant stop watching it till 6 AM."

This show starts off with an amazing pilot episode that can be boring for some but for most it's damn near perfect! Breaking Bad is one of those shows that just gets better the more you go through it! Walter White going from teacher to Heisenberg was amazing to see! I believe his character has one of the best developments in TV history! There are so many shocking and thrilling moments throughout this massive masterpiece and it is worth anyones time! Seasons 2-5 is when the show becomes unstoppable especially in the last 2 seasons when there is tension all over the damn place!

For the people just trying to find something to watch, don't give up on this series in season 1 because it's a buildup season on Walt and Jesse mostly and how they work together into becoming meth cooking legends LMAO jk jk jk but they are the best of the best at one point! There are amazing villains in this show as well and you will only be able to see them if you stay past the first few episodes of the show! If you still believe it's not your cup of tea stop watching and drop the ball at seasonXepisode 4x13 because that's a great ending for an early ""get out"". But I suggest going the whole way because it has probably the greatest ending of all time!"
10.0,29 October 2019,"So this is one of the worst TV shows I have EVER watched. The plot is pretty stupid, like why the hell would you cook meth for money for your cancer. Like you can do a fundraiser or walt could have got money from gretchen and elliot when he was offered and the treatments would have been taken care of. Not only does the plot make absolutely NO sensex its very very boring. Like I littlerly fell asleep watching it. Most of the time its showing stuff that is not related to the trash plot. The ONLY good thing about this show is the acting,Bryan Cranston,Arron Paul and Anna Gun did an outstanding job. Other than that the show is complete trash and I have no idea how people think this is the best show. ITS LITTERLY TRASHH!!!"
10.0,8 March 2021,"There's not much to say, honestly.

10.0,24 March 2021,"Greatest show of all time! The perfect show is all this world was asking and then vince gilligan delivered it. What an epic show it was started of slow , normal and then ended with greatness and being best of all. This is 99.1% pure show. If you've rewatched it then its 100% pure. Acting was top notch, Dialogues were epic, Cinematography is spectacular, Writing is goat. Character development of every single character is strong with walter white's god level character arc. This show has only one contender and that is its own prequel show ""Better Call Saul"". Only thing here to say is never give up on this show it will only get better. Its a slow burner but i think that what makes this show even more perfect. Season 1 was start Season 2 was beginning of an era Season 3 was true buildup Season 4 was a masterpiece and an end Season 5 was beyond what a words can explain. This is best thing i have ever seen. Watch it before you die, what are you gonna say to god , huh? I just wanna thank vince gilligan , whole team and cast like bryan cranston aaron paul and bob odenkirk for making this show come true and at its best."

10.0,5 February 2021,"Similar to the Micheal Corleone, Walter White took a sweet ride down a self destructive path while pursuing power, control and revenge in the name of family."
10.0,7 April 2017,"There are shows with excellent writing and acting, but no shows exist that can match the characters & storyline of Breaking Bad. This is a show that does everything right.. something that is very rarely seen in television & cinema in general. Whatever show you are watching and believe to be good, and whatever show you can think of that's currently popular, chances are they fall short in comparison to Breaking Bad."
10.0,9 August 2023,"Breaking Bad was an exceptional series that had me completely engrossed from start to finish. This gripping tale follows the transformation of a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White, into a formidable drug lord after he's diagnosed with terminal cancer. The intricate web of moral dilemmas, the gradual unraveling of Walter's character, and his partnership with former student Jesse Pinkman painted a vivid picture of the consequences of one's choices.

The show masterfully explored themes of power, morality, family, and the lengths people are willing to go to secure their futures. The intense chemistry between the characters, along with the tension-filled plotlines, held me in suspense throughout. From the blue meth manufacturing operations to the complex relationships and rivalries, ""Breaking Bad"" didn't shy away from portraying the gritty realities of the drug trade.

Each episode was a rollercoaster of emotions, and as the story progressed, the lines between right and wrong became increasingly blurred. This series was more than just entertainment-it was a gripping exploration of the human psyche and the darker corners of ambition. ""Breaking Bad"" is a testament to the power of storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on my viewing experience and solidifying its place as one of the most captivating shows I've ever had the pleasure to watch."
10.0,21 October 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a triumph in storytelling, character development, and cinematic excellence. With a riveting plot that never falters, it hooks you from the very first episode and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. The characters are flawlessly portrayed, particularly Bryan Cranston's Walter White, whose transformation from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord is nothing short of extraordinary.

The series' exploration of morality and the consequences of one's choices adds a profound layer to the narrative. Every episode is a masterclass in tension, suspense, and raw human emotion. The show's ability to tackle complex social issues while maintaining a thrilling narrative is truly commendable.

""Breaking Bad"" sets a new standard for television with its high production values, impeccable cinematography, and a script that keeps you guessing at every turn. It's a dark journey into the human psyche, an exploration of the fine line between good and evil, and a testament to the power of exceptional storytelling. Without a doubt, ""Breaking Bad"" deserves a perfect 10/10 rating for its unmatched brilliance in the world of television."

Who wouldn't love a perfect series to roll their mood to a whole new genre during this quarantine? Lucky for you this is the right one!....Breaking bad is a crime TV series that was created by Vince Gilligan. This one was an instant hit and won multiple awards in its time. It still is one of the best TV series till date and isn't at top of imbd for no reason all those little detail the series focuses on makes it more interesting to watch. The main cast such as Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn have excellently played their characters. Diagnosed with cancer, a high school chemistry teacher teams up with a high school drop out and starts cooking and selling methamphetamine to provide for his family. This led to them facing a lot of obstacle in their path but still with their hardwork and everything they go through all these!!"
10.0,13 June 2021,They say i have a good tasete in series and trust me if you haven't watched breaking bad am telling you that it will easly land on your top 10 if not 5 and of course if not 1. The start is kind of slow and boring but it gets better and better. I have watched over 50 series and this is the best one in my own opinion.
10.0,14 May 2020,Honestly the best series I have ever watched. 10 star would be less for Bryan Cranston.
10.0,30 September 2012,"This show starts off slow-fast and then starts to get crazy never in my life seen a show take of like this! this show deserves every award for everything it dishes out, you just don't know how crazy it can go until the unexpected happens. If some how? they killed off the head actors at the end of the show for a reason so they can keep doing what they are doing but made it in a 2hr movie and started it off with faking there deaths? and some how did it! would be a #1 movie to go see, I've seen this show yrs ago but never started watching it because just didn't have the time and thought it was just another show that wont last long but! i was wrong in every way and cant wait until i start watching season 4 tomorrow, please don't let the first season disappoint you and think its a nothing show because its far from that, this show has to fit into your personality in some way. GOOD LUCK"
10.0,3 April 2022,"I have watched so many web series and before watching it, I thought GOT was the best I have seen. If the GOT was Great, it is the Greatest I have ever seen. Although both the series made on different platforms but Breaking Bad has slight edge to GOT. All Time Favorite."
10.0,14 March 2020,Unbelievable good. A must watch for everyone. It literally changed my life..
10.0,19 March 2020,Indeed the Breaking bad is the best series ever All the seasons were great as well as each other
10.0,8 August 2019,"After almost 10 years since first watching it, this is still the best show I have ever seen. I have yet to watch a show that gets better with every season and ends perfectly. This is a must watch show."
10.0,19 September 2021,"This is an excellent show, and the protagonist Is the best character in tv history. Breaking bad has a good first season, and a great Last season. Everything in between is just ok. Season 4 felt like the finale of breaking bad. The final season is when I really fell in love with the show. It felt like The reason the Whole show was made so the song ""baby blue"" could play at the end. Also Ozymandias (the best episode in the series) is possibly the greatest episode in tv history. The series started fun, then the pacing in the middle became a waste of time. Breaking bad is a 10/10 because of the iconic moment, but if the show didn't have these it would be a 7/10."
10.0,6 March 2022,"Humor and action, acting and unpredictability, this show has the finest balance between all these elements. Love every second of it and the acting... godlike. It is the safest series someone can easily say is gonna be amazing, just start. My one of the few 10/10."
10.0,8 June 2020,If you haven't seen this yet it's absolute sacralidge that you haven't!... I was hesitant or kept putting it off til I didn't and couldn't stop watching it!... Great actors awesome storyline... Just watch it!...😊
10.0,24 March 2022,"I just watched Breaking Bad. Then I watched it a second time. And oh my god this show is a masterpiece. The writing in this show is honestly one of a kind and is definitely one of best shows if not the best show out there. The characters are so amazing as they have so much layers to them which many movies and tv shows forget to do. Walter white is the perfect lead as when you realize it he is the main villain of the show while you are still rooting for him. The supporting cast is also just amazing. Hank just reminds me of someone that I know in real life. The actor who played Jesse played this broken young man so well. Mike, Gus and Saul are also just perfect. This show is a show that gets better each season which is something most shows fail to do. Overall this show is a masterpiece and I recommend watching it."
10.0,11 July 2021,"American television tends to drag seasons out to 20+ episodes and a gagillion seasons in a series. Often making the show slowed paced with ridiculous continuations because the writers ran out of story. This show is well paced, interesting, great acting, and somewhat in the realm of reality. Also, the writers knew when the show needed to end instead of dragging it out. First series I have seen with a great ending that fit the story and the characters."
8.0,28 May 2023,"The only thing I can say is just wow. The character development in this series is just out of this world. I am a sucker for character development but breaking bad takes the crown. I can't even put words to how much I enjoyed this series. It had me on a tight grip from start to finish. I sometimes hear the words 'The Heisenberg Effect' which I think almost everyone who has watched the series can relate to. I was so captivated by his whole progression as a drug manufacturer that I looked past his progression as a person. It was only during the last season where things actually started getting out of hand that I came to the realisation. Just so incredibly sad and heartbreaking. Also for Jesse. I mean yes he was a junkie but at least he had people that loved him, I mean he loved himself I guess. It was the consequences of Walters, but also his, doings that made him lose everything he has ever loved. You just see two people addicted to making more money, playing more dangerous games. Ignoring the fact that to live up to that destroying everything they love. The cinematography of this series is what also did a lot for me. Considering it's quite a long series the cinematography doesn't get worse, it only gets better. I think Breaking Bad is one of the only series that gets better throughout. People might say season 1 is a little slow-paced. But it's hard to start from nothing, the more you watch the more info there is to go off of. So stop whining, get through the first season, because I promise you will not regret it!"
10.0,29 July 2020,"I have always been told that, after finishing up the series, those days ain't gonna come back.

I still agree..

One hell of a series. I blindly wish they make another season, any how, by any means..."

10.0,7 March 2022,It is phenomenal from start to finish. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. If you haven't watched it you should and if you did you know how good it is.
10.0,28 February 2014,"I have just finished Breaking bad and I feel like I've been on a roller coaster. I was recommended by a friend to see it and after a lot of critical acclaim I decided to give it a go, the gamble paid off. Breaking Bad exceeded my expectations and is one the best thing I have watched in a long time. If by any chance you are reading this then I would encourage to watch it as it is one of the best things to come out of Hollywood/studios in nearly ten years. This is a programme that will be remembered in fifty years, yes it's that good. I warn you though that season 4 can be a bit dreary at the start but the rest of the series pays off for this part as well as series 5 which is a masterpiece. It may have finished and the hype may have died down but I urge you to watch it as you will not regret it, trust me.I hope I could have played a small part to you the reader in persuading you to watch this, thank me later"
10.0,11 May 2020,"This series has got it all. From the incredible story build up to the unbelievably amazing character development , it has managed to capture the hearts of every single viewer. You definitely will not feel the same after watching it because of the extremely strong attachment you'll feel with the main characters. The show has one of the best and just strongest transformations of a main character ever made by a T.V series. With many great shows like GOT failing to end the show on a good note , Breaking Bad has managed to have a decent ending that gave its audience closure. This show just ranks on top in every single aspect there is."

10.0,3 September 2021,"I figured out Breaking Bad so late but after knowing that this is the top rated show I decided to watch it and it was the best ever decision I made. The begining of the show was good but as the show continued it became more addictive and interesting. I don't watch movies and tv shows too much but I watched the last two seasons of Breaking Bad in three days. I really wanna forget this show and watch it again. If you haven't watched it already, give it a try, u will get addicted to it."

10.0,2 March 2014,"I've been a long time fan of the Walking Dead and many Breaking Bad fans challenged me to watch breaking bad and when I finished all 5 seasons, tell them what I preferred. I agreed to this and started season 1. I feel it took me a while to feel enthusiasm for the show but gradually I connected more and more with the characters and learnt what they were about.

There is no doubt that Breaking Bad is one of them shows that you just don't want to stop watching, I found myself up till gone midnight, glued to my screen because it was just so incredible and thrilling. It is definitely one of the cleverest and most astoundingly written TV shows I have ever watched and probably tops most movies in terms of writing and the ability to tie all loose ends. Each season finale was fantastically rounded off with a clever cliffhanger to entice you back for the next season, it has every ingredient essential for the perfect show. The characters depth was fascinating and at times touching, it conveys perfectly a theme a desperation and fear along with the idea of your time running out, what will you do with it? You see incredible development with each character and see their slow but inevitable diminish into a life of crime, death and destruction.

Breaking Bad is undoubtedly one of the best TV shows I have ever seen and probably ever will see, Vince Gilligan's ability to write pure gold is definitely exhibited here. You can barely fault the shows continuity, it is practically spotless. The soundtrack was absolutely fantastic and the choice of Baby Blue by Badfinger for the final episode was absolutely perfect for the story. The cinematography was clever, relevant and at times unusual, but always seemed to work perfectly. The editing was mind blowing, it was imaginative, original and completely appropriate, it keeps you interested and entertained. Each field is covered in exactly the way it should be, and the actors were absolutely perfect. All convincing and powerful as well as emotive, they really draw in the viewer and put you on the edge of your seat.

It may seem like I'm giving endless praises but really, this series is faultless to me. I found myself almost in tears when it ended because I didn't know what to do with myself! I had no questions left to ask but so much to admire.

I completely recommend Breaking Bad to anyone, it is definitely not an understatement when people claim this as a masterpiece, if you haven't seen it yet, you are definitely missing out. I guarantee that this show will stick in your head for weeks on end.

When I was asked which show I enjoyed more, The Walking Dead or this? Of course, I said Breaking Bad."
10.0,10 May 2020,Top top series. And I don't usually watch TV... Acting 10/10. Cast 10/10. Writing 10/10.

10.0,6 February 2023,"My favorite TV show of all time right behind Better Call Saul! This is what you call a Perfect show! I was hooked from the beginning and really liked the first few episodes but when I watched S1 E6 that's when I started to realize that this might be able to become one of my favorite TV shows, and it did! All of the writers have done a great job, there's no single bad episode of the show in my opinion. Some of my favorite episodes: Felina, Ozymandias, Granite State, Face Off, Crawl Space, Full Measure, Half Measure, End Times, Four Days Out, Better Call Saul, Confessions, Crazy Handful of Nothin'."
10.0,15 May 2020,"Amazing show, great acting, awesome plot. I gave 9 points because i didnt like the last season as much as the other ones. Also i dont understand why everyone hates skyler, i actually liked her, she was trying to do the best for her family."
10.0,17 August 2020,If god could create a perfect show. It comes in the form of Breaking Bad!
10.0,17 November 2020,"This is the greatest crime drama ever. Period. The plot , the character build up and transformation. You could see Walter White going from a high school chemistry teacher to New Mexico's most wanted drug kingpin known as Heisenberg. And the cast is the best ever. This is one perfect ride from the Pilot to Felina."
10.0,8 July 2021,"I never seen a tv show that has important details like breaking bad , every detail is important to the story to the characters to everything i want to thank vince gligan for his magic hands and his creative brain on how to connect everything to build this fu**ing masterpiece , i watched it 2 times and i thinking for the third after better call saul ending."

10.0,12 February 2022,"Perfect story of a perfect crime. I never believed it existed before I saw breaking bad..

Moral of the story according to me is that even if life does bad or even worst you can't revenge it. But only when you enjoy the process of revenge..

I feel motivated to write a story as perfect as this one.."

10.0,2 April 2022,"I've watched a lot of shows in my time and this has to take the cake. This story takes us the eyes of Walter White. Walt is struggling over qualified high school chem teacher as well as a car wash worker. As a last resort, Walt turns to cooking crystal methamphetamine with his past student Jesse Pinkman. This takes them through their adventures with different cartels, bosses and other obstacles. All the characters are colorful and written magnificently. Easily the best show I've ever watched."
10.0,31 December 2013,"It is easier to talk about the things that are wrong with 'Breaking Bad' than those which are right, because it is such an incredibly short list. For the sake of balance, however, a summation of what makes 'Breaking Bad' worthy of the hype here follows:

A unique idea, fantastic writing which leaves very few holes (if any), perfect arc of characters and storyline, and excellent pace throughout every season. The tension of each season reaching a peak higher than the last, then dropping it back down but never quite as low as you were before, superb direction and production value, powerful performances that take you on a compelling emotional roller coaster ride and a sense of intensity that gets you truly caring about what happens to the people involved; the performances are phenomenal and they support the already well judged writing. With every bad event, every loss and pain, you the audience feel the weight of it. A great cast sell the whole thing perfectly, but standout performances throughout from Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, Emmy-winner Aaron Paul, who really did surprise me as the show moved forward, and ""the guy from every American TV show"" Dean Norris, who plays the rather annoying but ultimately very good Detective Hank Schrader. The music throughout is perfectly pitched, with a lot of source material driving the drama home perfectly.

It is also a show that gets in, does the job and gets out; it doesn't hang around for superfluous, flawed seasons. It's the show you will miss, rather than wish had ended by now. It is fair to say that upon watching the first season, you may not see what people are so obsessed with; if you reach the end of season three and aren't addicted, you may not be alive. The show develops slowly, exploring the realistic repercussions of the drug world chemistry teacher Walter White and ex-student Jesse Pinkman get themselves involved in.

The bad? A couple of dud episodes throughout the show, and a lack of finality for some characters; would have been nice to have seen more time spent with certain characters toward the end. Ironically for a show that is generally a slow-burner, the finale feels perhaps a little rushed out. Walter White's development is superb, though ultimately he doesn't ""bring the rain"" quite as heavily as I was hoping/expecting before......well, that would be spoiling the end.

The small quibbles aside, there is no doubt that Vince Gilligan has again created a cultural phenomenon with a TV show. On a geeky side note, keep an eye out for episodes directed by Michelle McLaren, she's a fantastic talent!"

10.0,28 June 2020,"Brilliant story, direction, best acting just everything brilliant. Man...can't believe I finished it just and can't stop myself by writing down what I felt about it. Sometimes you just don't want something to end and this is that kind of story. It beautifully depicts the double life almost all of us live. I bet Every character will remain etched in your mind forever. Jesse, Walter, Skyler, Hank....these characters are the best I have ever seen. Beautiful series. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are just brilliant. I became a fan of them. It's like a journey to watch this show. And the song in the end 'Baby blue' adds beauty to ending. Man seriously how can someone acts so well like Mr. Bryan Cranston. What touched me truly was that in the whole series Walter White kept on saying to Skyler that whatever he did, did it for family; but in the last episode he says whatever he did, did it for himself because he liked it. I mean you can think that a person who is going to be dead due to cancer, who is broken, who is hopeless, who is alive outside but dead inside, finds some reason to live the remaining time in meth making and eventually gets addicted to it. There are certain moments in which you (inspite of being the viewer and knowing that this is just a tv show) seriously want Mr. White to stop what he is doing and and be satisfied in whatever money he has aggregated. It also shows what addiction to something immoral can lead to. It teaches you the importance of taking right decisions and just stopping when your heart says stop."
10.0,9 June 2012,"I have been forced to write this review after watching 2 seasons of Breaking Bad. This is one of the best series I have seen. EVER. Bryan Cranston is BAD ASS and his acting is one to be remembered. It is such a different character compared to his role in 'Malcom in the Middle'.

For those of you who enjoy watching action combined with drama and subtle humour, this is for you. This series may start out a little slow to the average viewers but once you get hooked, its hard to take your eyes off it. Everything is so unexpected and well planned and each episode begins from exactly where the previous episode left off.

The acting is pretty good. One of the best part about Breaking Bad is the chemistry between Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. I love the attention to detail. Watch the series and you will know. The appearance of the characters that changes with time and such.

Ps : Breaking Bad is dark and it kicks ass ! THUMBS UP !"
10.0,7 March 2022,"I'm a recovering addict so I've purposely put off Breaking bad, Trainspotting 2 etc.

Just for people that don't know, watching someone use kicks something in and makes you want to score....

I can truly recommend this show and advise to watch until the end, unlike the lackluster Dexter finish, it actually delivers!"

I would definitely recommend watching it."
10.0,1 June 2020,"This by far the best TV series of all times and one that will surely never be surpassed. The acting, directing, photography and soundtrack are what should be shown at Film Schools as the ABSOLUTE perfection in their respective categories. The casting team deserves a statue and a holiday in their name. Vince Gilligan shall go down in history as the man who created and scripted the most interesting, unique, true and no BS story EVER. The man is a LEGEND. Breaking Bad is MILES ahead of the second. It is simply the BEST. MUST WATCH!"

10.0,9 January 2021,"Breaking bad is the definition of quality. It has everything a good show needs and even more. It is thrilling, suspenseful and has much more to offer than other shows on the crime genre. If you ask me, breaking bad is the foundation and the best show on the crime genre or even of all genres on TV."

10.0,13 August 2012,"I have always been more of a movie fan than a TV series fan but recently there have been a number of television productions which have changed my opinion. Breaking Bad has been one such show. Gripping, intense and 100% believable- the series tells the tale of a high school chemistry teacher who turns to cooking crystal meth with a former student in order to provide for his family knowing that his life is due to be cut short as he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Bryan Cranston is truly amazing as the protagonist- initially an amiable, family orientated character, the story displays his change in personality- quickly becoming the most important asset in the meth trade. Cranston is the star of the show but he is supported by a superb cast. Fully deserved of all the accolades, awards and critical acclaim, this series will suck you in and spit you out. I don't want to spoil the story line so I will simply recommend that you watch it. Not to sound clichéd but this is truly ground breaking viewing. The direction and storyline makes you empathise and sympathise with the wonderful characters. Truly magnificent."
10.0,30 March 2011,"This is by far an outstanding television show. Amidst a lot of other terrible TV this show stands out. The crux of this show is Walter White is a bored family man and incredibly smart science teacher who gets diagnosed with lung cancer. To pay for his treatment and to leave enough money for his family if he dies he teams up with an ex-student to start making meth. And so begins a web of lies to Walt's family and friends.

This show plays on so many emotions of the viewer. We know that what Walt is doing is wrong yet we sympathise with him because he loves his family and would do basically anything for them.

Bryan Cranston is outstanding as Walt. The thing that I love about this show is that when one episode finishes you just HAVE to watch the next one, and they have little links at the beginning of each episode that all make sense at the end of the season. There are so many little twists thrown in, I absolutely fell head over heels for this show. The characters all have their flaws but given all the circumstances it makes you question what you would do if you were put in that situation. Amazing."
10.0,1 August 2021,"A great story worth watching. Season 1 might seems slow and boring, however it's important to connect with charectors. Story becomes interesting after season 2."

10.0,25 May 2021,"Who knew a series could be crafted so perfectly? The writing, acting, direction and cinematography throughout the series deserves a 10/10. The tone and pacing of the show is well thought out, and each scene serves its purpose. It's been eight years since its finale, and I know one thing, I will always revisit Breaking Bad and the Vince Gilligan universe in hopes of having that same feeling I did when I first watched."
10.0,31 March 2022,"Everything about this show is perfect. The acting, the script, screenplay... Everything. This is the best tv show until a better one is made. And thank to this show we probably have the best spin-off series of all times."
10.0,29 May 2020,"The Greatest show ever filmed by camera!! it'll makes u laugh, cry, angry,love.etc. no other justified Walter white role like Bryan cranston did.. i wish that show must go on and on and on."
10.0,20 March 2022,"This is the best show of all time, I don't know how to go about describing why it is. It just is. The story is unlike anything I've ever seen and it is one of the most realistic shows ever (while still being satisfying to watch)."
10.0,8 July 2012,"The last season had just a teeny bit of drag for me, but I got over it. The new season starts next week and I cannot wait! It is the best show on TV for so many reasons. The writing is pure genius and the acting is perfection right down to the smallest roles. Anyone who has not watched this series from the very first episode cannot understand the hoopla. I've tried to explain it to friends and family, but no one understands until they watch that first season and get hooked. Breaking Bad is, like its own reason for existence, a drug. Oh, tried to post and I didn't write the minimum of ten. So...Way down upon the Swanee River, far, far away...now I have. LOL!"
10.0,29 July 2020,One of the best web series ever.. U will definately watch it more than once
10.0,28 June 2014,"To begin, I binged watched this show badly from start to end. I got to watch the series finale live and I'm thankful I did. I don't think my mouth dropped has many times watching this show than it did for anything else my whole entire life. Just the drama, crime, and pure awesomeness of the entire show brings a incredible connection with the viewers. For example, I like this show so much that when someone asks me ""What's your favorite TV show?"", automatically without thinking Breaking Bad pops into my head and out my mouth. This show has brought me to love and appreciate dramas and thrillers.

Not only the plot brought me to adore this show, but the characters and setting has well. Another example, Bryan Cranston aka Walter White (hope you knew that) is in a new movie or show, I suddenly have a interest and attraction for that film. Just the characters emotions and passion in the series is breath-taking. From Anna Gunn to Bob Odenkirk, the appreciation I have towards their hard-work and commitment is unimaginable. The setting is also perfect for the show. I seriously want to visit Albuquerque, New Mexico now. From the car wash to the school, much pleasure comes out in seeing how nicely they fit in with the rest of the show.

This is my first review for IMDb and I'm glad to do on something I love to watch. I am not a critic nor blogger, simply a dedicated fan. Yes, there are some few things I would of liked to go differently, but with television you cannot please everyone. I just want to give a shoutout to Mr.Gilligan for a spectacular job on an amazing piece of work. Thank you for reading my review and thank you Breaking Bad! Hope on seeing that spin-off soon!"
10.0,14 May 2020,Probably the best show ever made. This show have some magical powers which made me to see this show for second time maybe even more.
9.0,4 October 2019,"It's been a long time since this show aired but it still is better than most shows nowadays. It goes uphill, unlike GoT that went downhill lmaooo"
10.0,25 March 2020,"Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best actor portrayals I have ever seen. Malcom's father no more. This show is the best show in the ""5 seasons and under"" category. It starts out with the lead character (Cranston) already in a heap of trouble. You get hooked on episode one. I wish I could forget everything and watch it over again."
10.0,21 March 2020,"I just finished watching the last episode. A 5 season, 62 episode series with that much attention to details. Definitely will be watching again."
10.0,24 February 2022,"Walter White: From simple, high school science teacher to notorious meth cook and gangster - rarely has a show explored a singular character with so much depth and flare. One of the very few shows that checks off all the boxes; cinematography, charters, tension, and family.

As the season progresses, Walter (Cranston) navigates his partnership with Jesse (Paul) with love, hate, manipulation and mentorship. It's their tumultuous relationship that anchors the.chemistry of the show, and their journey together that makes this simply the best television series of all time."
10.0,13 May 2020,This is absolutely the best tv series.After watching this i actually couldnt watch any tv series.
10.0,23 August 2023,"""If the plot doesn't grab your attention, the characters certainly will. Walt, famously portrayed by Bryan Cranston, is one of the best characters I've seen in any show. He transitions from being a man afraid of his own shadow to becoming a known and confident figure throughout the entire Southwest United States. Aaron Paul, who portrays Jesse Pinkman, plays the complementary character and does such a good job in his role that Netflix made a movie about him titled El Camino. In addition to the main characters, Breaking Bad assembled a fantastic team of supporting actors, starting with Walt's wife, Skyler, and the grungy, unethical lawyer Saul Goodman, who also got his own spin-off television series, Better Call Saul, due to his brilliant performance.

This might seem like a typical drama series that Netflix wants to release for views. Some may dismiss it because it's over five years old. However, in its five seasons, Breaking Bad won 110 awards, including several Emmy's and Golden Globes, and garnered over 26 million viewers in the week following its release. As previously mentioned, the supporting characters had their own television series and movies because of the show's success. So, if you find yourself on another night scrolling through Netflix or any other streaming service for that matter, consider watching Breaking Bad. I promise, it won't let you down."""
10.0,15 July 2021,It is a must watch series. One of the best heart touching series. Just watch and feel it.
10.0,26 July 2020,If you haven't watched a perfect anti-hero it will be absolutely Walter White You'll see the amazing change in both life career from chemistry professor teaching students to a drug dealer and cook who started with minor drug dealing career till reaching the top of the profession. You'll absolutely enjoy it
10.0,1 August 2020,"9.5/10 IMDb rating. 234 Award Nominations. 153 Wins. 2 Golden Globes. 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. Listed As ""as the most critically acclaimed show of all time"" by the Guinness World Records. Do I REALLY have to CONVINCE you to watch this MASTERPIECE?"
10.0,30 June 2020,Best TV series of all time as the story is unique For me is the favorite TV series
10.0,15 January 2013,"Cranston's incredible ability to convey frustration, desperation, (and a good few other '-tions' as well) can't help but lead to wonder whether this was a role that was specifically written for him - it's certainly hard to imagine anyone better suited to it. This then, really does become a roller-coaster journey with that lead character and everything that the choices he makes present to him.

With plenty of seat-edge moments crammed into each episode and just enough dry (occasionally dark) humour to take the edge off, Breaking Bad is somewhat of a gem. It's hard not to feel perhaps a little exhausted at the end of each episode (which seem to end as quickly as they start), but with an overwhelming urge to start the next one straight away. Trust me when I say, with 5 seasons to watch you could very easily lose a week or two in one go."
10.0,16 June 2020,"BEST, only one word for the show. .... .... . .. ... ...

...

..."
10.0,28 January 2021,There is nothing new to say from other reviews. Is it me or Jonathan Banks looks like Selvester stalone
10.0,1 October 2022,"This is easily one of the greatest shows ever made. Occasionally some episodes felt a bit too long, but that's really just my short attention span causing me trouble. The writing is brilliant, acting is incredible, and there's some great cinematography as well. Also one of the best intros ever, it's short and to the point and has a great theme. The character writing is some of the best I can think of from any media form, characters are deep, believable, and have clear motivation and goals. There was never a moment where I was wondering why this character would do that. The whole story flows perfectly from season to season, it never feels unnecessarily drawn out. Only confusing thing is why there's an orange filter everytime they're in Mexico, it's a little silly at times. Nonetheless, it's hard for me to think of a series nearly as good as this one."
10.0,6 March 2022,This is hands down the best tv series ever created... by far. Nothing really comes close to this absolute masterpiece. Every episode is as enjoyable as the next. I can't name a single negative thing about this series.
9.0,27 June 2024,"Breaking Bad: A Paradigm-Shifting Series ""Breaking Bad"" marked the Golden Age of Television, introducing us to male anti-hero protagonists. Walter White, a chemistry teacher turned meth kingpin, captivated audiences. The show's cinematic visuals, barren desert landscapes, and meticulous montages set it apart. The Netflix bump fueled its popularity, proving that viewers could find shows on their own time1.

El Camino: A Coda to Jesse Pinkman's Story ""El Camino"" picks up after Jesse Pinkman's escape from neo-Nazis. The film feels like two extended episodes of ""Breaking Bad,"" maintaining the show's quality. Vince Gilligan's direction and writing shine, but revisiting a fan-favorite character lacks the novelty of the original series. It's a well-executed coda, documenting Jesse's quest for freedom while avoiding spoilers."
10.0,14 June 2012,"I love this series and it is true to it is title. It is about a good man that breaking bad by just trying to be helping his family. It does make you see that breaking bad is one step at a time thing and sometimes it may start with good intentions.

I must say that I have been watching the recorded version of the show for the most part and that I had to fast-forward over some gruesome parts in order to enable myself to follow it after avoiding for a long time.

The acting is superb. The plots are highly inventive. The dialog is well written.

I don't think that it could have been done any better this.

What I find that is hard to believe, is that I am watching it. Only this year after watching this series I have been able to watch gruesome crime shows which I have avoided most of my life.

Now I am catching up on TV crime shows and having watched a few, this is the best one of the lot and highly unique."
10.0,13 April 2021,
10.0,3 August 2021,"Especially because of the main character, you can see his change with time, a normal poor man who transform into someone cruel."

I'll just point out every single 1 star rating on here has terrible grammar and let that fact speak for itself. 😂"
9.0,20 August 2020,"Great storyline, great acting, loved it. You go through a vast array of emotions with several of the main characters. Mr White is a slow moving train wreck but you can't look away"

10.0,4 February 2022,"The best show ever made.

Absolutely insane acting, brilliant writing, so dark and twisted yet hilarious and entertaining.

Binge watch worthy.

Recommend this 10000%"
10.0,17 August 2022,"The writing is indeed masterful, and one aspect of the show frequently overlooked is the very well played dark comedy despite the story being dramatic. Seasons 1 and 2 are fun, while Season 3 is masterful. However, there are always strangely slow moments which I've never heard any good reason for. People just want to blindly praise the show so they claim some BS reason like 'it builds tension' or 'it's like real life'...but the way the slow pacing is done is just a waste of time. This is what burdens much of the overrated season 4. For 10 episodes, basically nothing happens. Then season 5 comes back in full swing and an amazing, phenomenal ending. Thankfully they ended it soon enough, unlike Better Call Saul which was 3 season's worth of story stretched over 6 seasons. The pacing was abysmal!"
10.0,26 March 2022,"Hell of a series. I laughed, I cried, I cheered and I hated. Was on the edge of my seat and guessing at times. Some episodes are better than others but I can honestly say that I was never bored in any episode.

There's an empty spot I need to fill now am currently waiting Better Call Saul and will certainly watch the BB movie to see what happens to Jesse. 10 out of 10 for me."
10.0,5 April 2022,"I've been binge watching this show for now and every episode keeps you on the edge. From the OST to heisenberg and jesse, the characters are just perfect.

The beset show ever!"
10.0,28 August 2018,Just the best tv series i've ever seen in my entire life
10.0,16 March 2022,
10.0,24 February 2022,"This show has some of the best written characters ever!, this show tells a story the right way and by the end of the show you feel for these characters and you understand them.

I would recommend this to everyone because of how entertaining and addictive it is with every season leaving on a massive cliffhanger.

AMAZING!!!"
10.0,21 July 2021,"I know this review will probably get buried but i have to put it out there and further increase the overall rating of this show. I used to watch this show with my Grandpa right before the series finale in 2013. Each episode kept us at the edge of our seat and was exciting to watch. It was engaging even when watching out of sequence and not knowing what happened in the previous episode. I just finished the entire series on Netflix and it was even better watching the episodes in order. Like many other people have said, I also wish I could watch it over again for the first time. It is absolutely brilliant how the creators of the show moved us to root for the villain. I knew how it was going to end, but I didn't expect how well it would be done. Finishing this show felt like finishing a classic. I can't help but sense it's alluding to some ancient story or anecdote (like a lot of good movies do), but I can't pinpoint what. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this show is bound to transcend generations and will be enjoyed again and again in the future. There is not a single note I would give to the actors, the set design, the lighting. I wouldn't swap out a single major or minor actor for another one. This show is as close to perfection as it can get."
9.0,3 February 2022,"I highly recommend to watch this show, it shows different angles of life from different people with different life goals. It all comes together as a very strong tv-series, there are epic cliffhangers on the season finales and a truly amazing story-line right up until the final episode of the show!!!"
9.0,29 July 2021,"I will keep it short. It is based on a story of cancer facing chemistry teacher who gets to became the drug lord of south west America to fulfill his desires and kind of provide for his family during the time of recession. Coming to positives, the storyline is just amazing and well-implemented on the screen for which I would like to appreciate the makers and this makes it least boring show I ever saw. The acting and the actions are excellent and the music soothing especially the intro one. It introduces us to a drug crystal meth or methamphetamine not known much to us. I have no criticism except the role of DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) playing key role in the society not emphasised in the ending although portrayed in positive light. Further , I would suggest you to watch its prequel like Better Call Saul and El Camino for moving further. Till next time , Have a A-1 day."
10.0,19 November 2021,"What can I say about this show that hasn't already been said? It's bar-none and without a doubt the greatest and most brilliant TV show ever created. The acting is magnificent, the dialog is superb and the storyline is flawless and keeps you guessing. I've watched the series 3 times now and I'm sure I'll watch it again one of these days. The basic gist of the show is a meek and mild-mannered chemistry teacher is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He decides to use his vast knowledge of chemistry to manufacture crystal meth to make large sums of money to ensure his family is provided for after he dies. There is so much more to it than that, but that is the basic story. If you haven't seen it, YOU MUST! The only downfall is certain scenes here and there tend to drag on a little too long and the first season is kind of a slow-burner, but around the start of season 2, it's the best television around. The show is addictive and very binge-worthy. 5/5 stars."
10.0,14 September 2020,The first seasons were not that good but the last ones were greeeeeeaaaat :)
10.0,17 March 2020,"I was a late bloomer with this one, skeptical at first that I could get into a show about meth. Once I got through the first season I was hooked. Each season gets progressively better than the last, a rarity when it comes to television these days. Hands down one of the best shows of all time!"
10.0,30 June 2021,The best show of all time never have I seen a show this I finished this show in a week I thought this show was going to be normal but it was a gift from god.
9.0,27 March 2020,"Shakespearean levels of writing allow for this show to be as good as it is. A protogonist so cruel yet u still root for him, an episode as good as Ozymandias doesn't just happen it is and always will be the result of breaking bad being the greatest ever show. Still think the Sopranos is better? How many shows have an episode with a 10/10 rating? -1: breaking bad. How many shows hold a Guinness world record for their acclaim ? 1: breaking bad. How many shows scored a 99/100 on metacritic. I'll give u a hint not the sopranos"
10.0,7 January 2021,This is The best tv show i seen in my entire life.
10.0,29 June 2020,"In a year 2040, Son : Breaking bad was the greatest show ever made. Dad : You're goddamn right."
10.0,29 December 2014,"First of all, anyone who claims that this show is overrated or not that great or only gives it 1-4 stars either: a) never watched it b)is jealous that it is critically acclaimed more than their favorite show, c)doesn't know art or acting or d)is stupid or e)all of the above.

That being said, this film, yes film-its not really a TV show since it is moving towards a conclusion from episode 1 and the story arc and acting talent and writing are all more cinematic than television- is not for people who have ADD or can't think. It's not for short attention spans. If you're stupid you won't like it. It's for smart people who know art and filmmaking, which is why it won and was nominated for so many Emmy awards and awards in general.

It has the highest rating in the guiness book of world records, was lauded by critics, showered with emmies and trophies, and big name superstars like Stephen King, Anthony Hopkins, and many more stand by their praise that it's the ""greatest show"" they ever seen.

It actually deserves more than 10/10. It's genius, a masterstroke of art, brilliant, and transcends the medium. Anyone who thinks it's a 1-4 star rating is nuts. Not only is it in many top critics' picks the greatest show of all time, but it has the hardware (Emmies and trophies of all awards) to prove it. The Writers Guild voted it #11 all time on its Best Written Shows list. That's probably not just- it should be in the Top 3, but that's All- Time.

If you don't appreciate Breaking Bad, you don't know movies, acting, art, and you can't be very intelligent. It's mind blowingly great filmmaking and definitely is an All American Classic for the Ages.

If you never saw it, be patient. It starts slow, especially the middle of season 2 and some of the beginning of 3, but if you can stay in there and not read the spoilers, I guarantee you this will be the greatest thing you ever experienced on a screen- greater than any movie you ever saw. A classic masterpiece hands down, bar none. 20/10. ""Greatest Show of All Time."" Guaranteed. And best acting performances of the past 50 years."
10.0,7 February 2023,"Resume (no spoil) :

So the series begin on a house and we see a family ""Walter white"" the dad, ""Skyler White"" his wife and ""Walter junior"" his son.

We see after Walter White go to a school because is the professor of chemisty after this hour of school he go to his onother job wash car.

After this he get faintless and go to a hospital and the doctor say he got a lung cancer but he live in America, they dont have mutual so that cost alot.

After that he got an idea create meth for gain money for his family and he will be help by a old student ""Jesse Pinkman"" because he know he do meth to.

So we gonna see the rest of the series the adventure of Walter white doing meth and Walter white whif his family.

My Review:

This series is perfect all of the character have a history and they so good anthagonist like ""Gus"", i love watching this series again and again.

Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are one of the best-written characters from a series.

This is the greatest show ever."
10.0,1 July 2020,Best shows ever made. It definitely deserves to be one of the high rated shows.
10.0,24 December 2014,"This entire show is an absolutely flawless work of art. Fantastic writing brought to life by some outstanding performances, especially from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul whose relationship is really the foundation throughout all 5 seasons of the show. The great character development will leave you with strong feelings towards each character, be it love (Jesse) or hate (Skyler).

More than just a show about drugs, this show investigates how a 50- year-old man can turn from ""Mr Rodgers with lung cancer"" to a criminal mastermind and shows how this sends his life spiraling into darkness.

This is done is such a way that will leave you wanting more after every episode - I finished the entire show in a week! I truly believe this show is unrivaled in TV today, including GOT which I am also a fan of. I have watched and re-watched Breaking Bad with family and friends, and if you have not seen it yet, I would highly encourage you to get watching! You will not be disappointed."
10.0,6 July 2020,The best..... simple as that.....watch it to know it
10.0,29 July 2020,The mind blowing series I have seen in my whole life
10.0,12 July 2021,"This is quite simply the best TV show I've ever seen. Impeccable writing, acting and production all round. It never once dips or meanders and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the last minute of the last episode. I wish I could reset my brain and watch it for the first time all over again."
9.0,15 May 2020,Best show of all time. I apparently need to write a longer review for this to count but the title of the review summed it up.
10.0,13 July 2020,This is really a good series and something that I will remember for the rest of my life! I would not forget the journey of Walter and Jesse with all the things they've been through. The story is really good!
10.0,13 March 2020,Can't believe I'm just watching this. One of the best TV shows ever if not the best.
10.0,13 October 2015,"How far will you go for the sake of your family? What will you do for providing your family a better life and better future? If you want your answer this is the show. A father who is a chemistry teacher, and suffering from lung cancer gets involved in the manufacture of meth-the pot, so as to earn money for his family and provider them a better future after he is gone. It is his story how he handles every situation and saves himself till the very end. The role of Jessi Pinkman is the one, which gives the show a cutting edge, how he always creates problem for Mr. Walter White. Hence, all i would say is that it is a must watch show... and those who are in love with chemistry its like icing on the cake...!!!"
10.0,25 March 2022,"A masterpiece that you should must watch. I've watched it over and over and i don't feel bored cuz any episode is just masterpiece. Go and watch it on netflix. The idea for Breaking Bad came to Gilligan during a phone call with a friend while he was unemployed. Gilligan envisioned a heroic figure slowly transforming into the plot's villain. The pitch described Walt's transformation as ""Mr. Chips becoming Scarface,"" but he found it difficult to pitch the idea to networks."
10.0,27 July 2021,"He's the best and the one on the tv History If you don't agree with me, you have a psychological problem unfortunately."
10.0,19 March 2022,"There is a reason this show is looked so highly upon. Whether it be the incredible characters, the plot, or the perfect cast, there is barely a single flaw with this show. I would say it has aged like fine wine, but it was better than a fine wine from the beginning. There is not a single bad episode of this show, even the fly which is considered to be the worst of the series is better than most other television episodes."

9.0,2 May 2020,"Everyone said it was great. I expected a lot and got even more. This series has perfect amount of everything: drama, humor, action, intelligence, darkness, building of characters... And all that with great acting, directing and scenography. Hands down, the best series I have watched till date. 10/10"
10.0,2 June 2020,"Breaking Bad is a masterpiece. No other show has intrigued me so much. Right from the first episode it keeps the viewers addicted to it. Every single character is believable and interesting. Instead of relying on over the top action and flashy visuals, Breaking Bad captures your attention through a fantastic narrative that leaves a deep impact on your mind. It's a must watch.

Also the ending of the show is so beautiful and satisfying. It ties up all loose ends and leaves nothing incomplete. But to see the complete character arc of Jesse Pinkman, I highly recommend watching El Camino after finishing the series."
10.0,29 January 2022,"Breaking Bad is great. Everyone knows that. Writing, Acting, Directing, Cinematography, blah, blah. What I don't find being mentioned as much is how addictive the show is, paired with its subject matter. See, the show's central story is the steady degradation of a meek yet dissatisfied man into a dissatisfied monster. It's not exactly the most enriching or inspiring story, but you can't help watching it because it's so wel done. I think that is where the core problem of the show lies, one that prevents it from being a truly outstanding show. It executes its tragic story very well, it knows Walter White is making all the wrong decisions, it is a great tragedy. But this tragedy runs for 60 or so episodes. By watching this show, you are dedicating a good amount of your time to a depressing story, one that kinda has you rooting for a bad guy, only because he is framed as the protagonist. The length of Breaking Bad is perfect for its story, but the story is not perfect for that length. And that's why I'd warn one considering this show to tread lightly, to not give into the binge, this is not the show to binge or spend a lot of your time on in a short amount. Watch it sparingly, you'll probably find the journey less mentally taxing and more fulfilling."
10.0,13 May 2020,"I have rewatched it 6 times....and it is the greatest series in the history of tv . All the hype of breaking bad is true, and if you watch it you will know. You cant think of anything else and most importantly ""you will never be the same""."

We see all the thing like hiest , gunfight , mastermind and brilliancy . And about writing , the writer write brilliantly . There is not a single scene which is overwhelming . The conclusion is this is If you don't seen it then i highly recommending ."

9.0,1 June 2010,"Although Bryan Cranston has won the Best Actor Emmy now two years in a row, I think people are still really slow to catch on to ""Breaking Bad"". Perhaps it's because it's on Showtime and not accessible to all, perhaps it's the premise which, if like ""Dexter"" is explained in one or two sentences, might seem off-putting -- I don't know. But I'm so glad a friend of ours mentioned it to us a year or so ago, and we immediately NetFlixed to catch up so that we can be watching this season as it unwinds.

I love everything about this show -- the acting, writing, directing -- and I have to put it up there with other great shows like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Dexter"" that find a way to skillfully inject humor into the most seemingly horrible/terrifying/grim situations. We have since turned several people onto this show, but my husband's best friend still isn't budging -- he insists he finds the premise too ""depressing"" and just won't give it a chance. Too bad -- he's missing a real gem."
10.0,25 June 2020,Teriffic acting and plot story.Best tv series I ever watched till date.
10.0,8 June 2020,"For me this series is like ""slow and steady wins the race"" -and steals the show. The man, Walter=Heisenberg left only ruins and death behind him , but in the end, he had no regret. he died with his baby blue. At the end of the show you will cry."

9.0,11 March 2020,"When you don't sleep for several days/weeks because of a series,then this is something serious..."
10.0,20 March 2020,"I always heard about Breaking Bad, but I never thought it was the show for me. But one day I started to watch it, as soon as the first episode was done I was hooked. The show has amazing writing and great acting, each episode leaves you wanting more. You get really attached to the characters. Excellent"
10.0,22 May 2022,"This show is superb in every way, from the acting and characters, to the plot and everything in between. You really cannot find much better than this, it is arguably the best show to ever air on TV."
10.0,29 January 2022,"Even though my personal favorite is Hannibal, I can't deny the fact that this is probably the best TV show ever made. It has everything you want and more. The character development is great, and the story progresses with the help of phenomenal villains and the twist and turns. You can't hate this show period."
10.0,15 September 2020,"Sit in front of the TV, watch and have fun Because this series and all its details are very interesting, very entertaining, the characters are also, and all its details are interesting, and all the witnesses are genius. There were no weak scenes that did not respect our minds."
10.0,12 April 2022,"Hands down the best series ive watched so far.

The simple and interesting concept gets introduced very well in the first season. The later seasons get more tense and better tho with alot of great acting performances and well writen storys. The consistency of the quality is top notch and the series gets a perfect ending which i rarely see with shows these days. 9.5/10!"
10.0,5 January 2014,"Without a Doubt I can tell you that Breaking Bad has blew my mind. Wide Open! Truthfully I didn't think much would come out of this show and judging on all the Hype I thought it was massively Overrated. Well I can tell you now that I haven't been more wrong in my life then the day i had that thought in my mind.

Season 1 starts off as you would expect from the greats of Recent T.V history. A Normal guy by the name of Walter White gets stage 3 Lung Cancer just after his 50th birthday and for the future of his family decides to start cooking Blue Meth. As the show gradually progresses we see Walters slow rise into the Drug Business as by the time Season 5 hits Walt has gone from an ordinary guy doing ordinary things to cooking Top of the Range Meth and becoming a major force in the Drug world. The show is breathtaking from start to finish for each season keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Every movement every reaction and every line spoken by not just one but all the actors is of pure perfection something that you would rarely get in the Art of Film and Television these days. More often than not the suspense the show manages to build is fantastic and very cell done. Even with limited action scenes in the Shows life we are still begging for more come the end of each episode.

However the Performances that top the Cherry in Breaking Bad has to be the Wonderful Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul playing Walter White and Jesse Respectively. Both men put in breathtaking effort into there roles something that thy will never be able to overdo regardless of what the future holds in store for the two. The chemistry between them is jaw dropping. Straight from the pilot they click together fantastically well and I feel that the show truly does work best when it's just scenes with Jesse and Walter involved. Fully deserved of their Emmy Wins.

Finally to cut a long story short the Final Season is possibly the best climax I've seen to a TV show. It manages to avoid a controversial ending with many answers left unanswered ( Lost / Sopranos) and instead gives us an ending that we were all desperately hoping for. The Journey of Walter White will be one that will take a very very long time to forget. Vince Gilligan has done a sensational job creating the World that lies in Breaking Bad and for that it will be remembered as one of the greats in TV history. And rightly so....."
10.0,14 July 2014,"Breaking Bad is easily one of the best dramas of all time for TV. I would even go so far as to say its better than most movie dramas as well. Since the first scene of season 1, you are taken through a ride of Walter White's middle aged crisis, in which he reallies he hasn't achieved anything in life. Which is a perfect reason to start a meth empire. There is no such thing as a 'filler' episode in Breaking Bad, just continuously brilliantly written and acted episodes, in which there is never a dull momment and the tension only goes higher. I have never watched a television show as well thought out and detailed as this, and every character's judgements and actions make perfect sense, and not just added in for more TV time and twists. If you have not witnessed the amazement of Breaking Bad, I urge you to go out and watch all 5 (or is it 6?) seasons. It is so well done, I even got it tattooed on my arm, as a reminder to the sheer brilliance that can be created and why I should start watching more television shows."
8.0,17 October 2019,"Never wrote a comment before, but starting to watch again for the second time, brilliant acting, brilliant writing, for the people who have never seen it I would totally recommend, but, don't get trapped into binge watching otherwise you'll never get to work the next day."
10.0,9 July 2023,"Breaking Bad is cinematic masterpiece, first two seasons might feel bit slow, but it gets more intense by season three and s4-s5 are rollercoasters of emotions. It has amazing camera shots and stories of each character, the ending and the road to that ending are just perfect, ideal way to close such a great tv show. But the ""main"" thing of Breaking Bad is, evolution of each character, if you take certain charactera from S1 and compare them to S5, it's crazy how different they are, but they are still the same people. I would also recommend watching Better Call Saul after Breaking Bad, another masterpiece at Breaking Bad's level."
8.0,11 July 2020,
10.0,3 January 2022,"Absolutely love it. I've watched it several times already it's just a shame it had to come to an end. The characters are brilliant and Walter White, what can I say....the best character on tv ever. Outstanding tv show."
10.0,3 October 2016,
8.0,10 April 2017,
9.0,13 June 2020,"If you are here for review then you are disrespecting this masterpiece.this show only need love and admiration. This show is most detailed show of all time.every scene,each frame,each word,each facial expression has its own story. Each title of this show has also its own story."
10.0,19 June 2020,"Breaking Bad has always been one of my all time favourite shows, but after seeing so many other brilliant shows after it, I began to wonder if my opinion was changing. To reassure myself that the show is great, I gave it a rewatch. And it's even better than I remember it

Whether it's the characters that I appreciated much more like Skylar and Mike, or the subtle character development in episodes like Peekaboo and the Fly, Breaking Bad still remains as one of the most perfect shows ever created

After watching a fantastic show like Game of Thrones crash and burn in its final moments, it's nice to see a show that manages to stick the landing. breaking bad ( and other examples like Mr Robot ) tell us that the best way to execute a narrative driven drama is with one main show runner. Of course it also helps that Vince Gilligan is a damn good writer

There isn't much else to be said about breaking bad that hasn't been said a million times before. This show is truly my star, my perfect silence

10/10"
9.0,22 August 2023,
8.0,30 June 2020,"I saw the entire series in one week, best week ever. The show is a little slow, but that's what builds the suspense."
9.0,24 March 2024,"An inviolable series that cannot be faulted easily, everything about it is excellent, it is not without reason that it has been ranked first on this site.

Its strength is its cinematography, which is the best cinematography I have seen from a series that really surprises the audience.

The actors of this series have definitely shown one of their best works, which shows us a strong acting.

Unlike other series, this series becomes stronger as we go forward, which are also very rare series in the world.

The fifth season was one of the best seasons I have seen from a series and it has the best possible ending, even if it is not the best, it is definitely one of the best. I wish I could clear my mind and watch this series again.

All I can do is give it a 10 out of 10."
10.0,25 June 2020,"This is best show I've ever seen so far 10/10 amazing dialogues , well played characters with a perfect ending, couldn't be more perfect"
10.0,22 May 2021,No replacement for this masterpiece! The best series ever made. 🤘🏻
10.0,23 August 2023,"The greatest work I have seen, Breaking Bad, is a work that will be immortalized in history. The fact that all series after it are just anime for children. I believe that Breaking Bad is the only series that combines drama and excitement in a distinct and elaborate manner. I have watched many series, but I have not watched a series like Breaking Bad. In terms of everything, the acting, the events, the characters, the story, the plot turned out to be a great thing in this great TV show, and the truth is to say that it is the most beautiful integrated series and its closest competitor is very far from it. Thank you to those who presented this immortal masterpiece to us."
10.0,26 June 2020,"This series is my favorite.love Black Mirror...these two are the best in TV history . GOT was also good and that was going to beat these two but last 2 seasons were terrible. now i can give GOT 7 with Favor. but this film is Perfect . If you didnt see, good for you, cause you gonna see the best TV show Ever . and please take it as an advise dont watch GOT Last season ruins it all."
10.0,29 May 2021,
10.0,5 June 2020,Nothing better. Watched approx 6 times. Will watch again.
8.0,25 July 2017,"I've watched a lot of TV series and i don't love most of them, Breaking bad is not my favourite in terms of mere entertainment, but its a very infringing story and the way it is written its compleatley in another league.

If you're a cinephile you must watch this more than once, I've seen it 3 times and every time i find something new."
10.0,1 July 2020,There is scenes in BB that stays in your head for ever. The result of a perfect build. No one make TV like Vince Gilligan.
10.0,7 March 2013,"I highly recommend that you watch this show. A fantastic drama series with touches of comedy. Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he ""never smoked."" His finances are in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems. Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his brother-in-law Hank played by Dean Norris, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. This is really Bryan Cranston at his best & has rightly deserved all awards given to him for this character. All in all - Great cast, Great acting & Story lines are captivating. A MASTERPIECE!"
10.0,10 July 2020,
8.0,8 April 2021,I watched Bryan Cranston transform a rather ordinary chemistry teacher who caught a bad break into a dichotomous antagonist/protagonist with awe. Fantastically written. Top Level Acting. Enthralling. Slow burn. Characters are just extraordinary.

10.0,12 December 2020,"Yes, the writing is great, the cinematography, the direction on each and every episode. Vince Gilligan is a genius but, it was really Bryan Cranston that gave an A class performance, lifting every other actor and carrying this series with grace. Sure, every piece is paramount, but Bryan was the ace in the hole. Highly recommended."
9.0,21 May 2021,My number one TV show. And I hope all TV show like breaking bad.
10.0,24 June 2020,"A must watch, and no question the best show i have ever seen. As a lot of people said here, i want to erease my memory just so i can watch this beautiful piece of art again"
10.0,27 May 2020,The best thing to do is to watch it. You won't regret it.
10.0,29 August 2018,This is my favorite show of all time not many people watch this show but the people who do give it a 10/10 Stars like me GREAT AWSOME THE BEST SHOW IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!! NO JOKE
10.0,3 June 2020,I have no words to describe how spectacular this is. Each episode surpasses the previous one and you're always surprised by everything that happens. He never loses his rhythm and has an unparalleled levelI have no words to describe how spectacular this is. Each episode surpasses the previous one and you're always surprised by everything that happens. He never loses his rhythm and has an unparalleled level.
9.0,14 October 2012,"I think Breaking Bad is one of the best shows in the recent years that reflected the ever lasting conflict between good and evil. Highly presented to the audience; screenplay, story facts, acting crew and directing. All aspects of this work have always proved being on top of everything else that's being played as these episodes keep you excited with curiosity every time one of them is on! Simply amazing...! In relation with violence as a factor that keeps growing bigger in each episode, where comes the smartness of this work, you find yourself supportive to such acts as a point of sympathy with the characters, where - at the end - are pure criminal acts! This work puts you in real conflict with yourself, sometimes, as you keep trying to understand the necessity to survive by practicing all morally wrong things you've ever known in your life!"
10.0,7 September 2022,"There's never going to be another piece of fiction quite like it. It's by far my favourite fictional story ever, greater than any other show, film or book. It is quite simply... Unbeatable. It's perfect in every aspect, and doesn't have a single bad episode. The lowest rating I actually gave an episode was 6/10, and that was only once. Pretty sure my average episode rating will be around 8.5/10, but the show as a whole is just phenomenal. I genuinely don't have a single issue with it, and I tend to be quite harsh with my ratings for movies & TV series! I'm really looking forward to revisiting El Camino, and finally getting around to watching Better Call Saul."
10.0,25 January 2022,This is one of the few series I actually own on Blu-Ray. It is so worth buying. Unlimited rewatchability. The writing and performances are amazing and I was captivated only a few minutes into the pilot. I remember when I learned about this series in 2012 binge-watching to catch up only to have to wait what felt like 6 very long months for the finale. It was all worth it though because the writers did an amazing job bringing this series to an end in a really good way.
10.0,14 September 2020,Get ready to get addicted to this show! Every episode will make you want to watch more.
10.0,19 December 2020,"Im not the one for T.V series but this one I had to watch twice, once by myself when it first came out. I was young, then again with my GF when I was older. The second watch was just as great as the first. I will always remember this show for sticking to its roots and never getting off track with it's plot, Yes the ending could of been 100 percent better and yes the last season kinda was a drag.

Now that I think about it, I really do wish they didn't have to end it like that but still AMAZING!"
10.0,28 June 2020,"This is truly a master piece. I just recently saw Br Ba and regret not watching it earlier. Its a must watch you guys. All characters are there for a reason and everything that happens is beautifully linked somehow. I dont want to reveal too much. Watch it guys, I am sure you will not regret it. Cheers!"
10.0,11 July 2020,"You wont like any other show ever. Breaking bad has set the bar really high. I am always unimpressed by other shows after bb. The acting,writing,cinematography,direction everything is so perfect"
10.0,14 May 2020,BEST SHOW EVER MADE ON TELEVISION!!! I HATED TO SEE SERIES END!!! I've rewatched every season 7 x and never seem to be able to stop watching it! I wish the show would come back! I miss Jessie!!! U ROCK!!!
10.0,17 September 2010,"I saw this on the wall at the video store so many times. I even picked it up a few times, but always moved on to something else. I finally one day brought the first season home for my wife and I to watch. We were hooked! This is our favorite show now. The word needs to get out about this show because it is the best show on TV right now and no one has heard of it. If you haven't watched this show, do yourself a favor. There are some slow moments in the first season, but it all pays off. It seems like such a strange premise, man cooking meth with some flunkie kid he use to teach in high school, but somehow they pull it off. The complexity of the story is compelling and the acting is spectacular. Its starting to seem like there are better shows on the cable channels than network TV now. This show is up there with Rescue Me for any you FX fans out there."
10.0,18 September 2014,"It's already been said many times, but this show is great. Well written, great acting, good story line. However, I find it very predictable, and therefore it doesn't get me as hooked as I was with Lost or Prisonbreak. For example (saw this today), the shoe that gets stuck on the ceiling lamp when Walt is trying to catch a fly. But it also happens with the more important things, it's just not that exciting, but just perfect drama. Also small details are not explained (which is perfectly done in Lost...) . For example the green stuff Walter Junior sees on the fridge, which came from Skylar's face. He sees it, but his thought or reaction about it is never revealed. Will keep watching till the end though (currently in season 3) :-)

It's 2,5 months later now and I have finished the show, and therefore I must edit my review... Wow it really got better in season 4!! Much more exciting, really really loved it till the end! Sorry if I ever made anyone doubt to watch it, with my previous comments, really gotta watch this show! <3"

10.0,13 May 2013,"The writing is nearly flawless, and the acting is very good. Simply the best show on TV right now. Period. For years, I have declared my favourite show ever to be The Sopranos, and it still could be.... but this one has to be very close. Most shows seem to take you down paths that never seem to go anywhere, and you are always left with questions unanswered. When all is done, this one may also have questions, but so far, the writing has been complete. My only complaints are that we had to wait so long to see the final season, and that the writers are stopping at only 6 seasons - probably could have gone for at least 1 more..."

10.0,26 August 2020,This is not a series.. This is emotion... This is feelings...
10.0,31 December 2013,"For any body that hasn't watched Breaking Bad I can tell you that it is a absolute master piece and must be viewed. At the Heart of the story is Walter White(Bryan Cranston) that plays a terminally ill chemistry teacher that cruelly persuades a drug addict Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to produce crystal meth in order to provide a stable future for his family. But this cruel persuasive side of Walter is a drop in the ocean as he becomes increasingly unstable and applies his wonderful mind to a much darker way of life. Bryan Cranston blew me away when I saw how comfortable he looked in this role. Of course we all know him from Malcom in the Middle and I think that was why it was so unexpected. However, despite Bryan Cranston's fantastic performance I must say the star of the show for me was Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) who displayed incredibly vivid and heartfelt acting throughout the series. From the strongest hate and desperation to the saddest and loneliest emotions that one just lay mesmerised in front of the television. As the first episode begins we are hurled into the craziest of scenes that one cant help their curiosity be captured . Each episode evokes countless reasons to continue watching and your totally at the mercy of small build ups and mini climaxes that I consider to be a genius bit of television. Throughout Walters journey we see him make some terrible and devastating decisions but we somehow understand and almost justify his reasoning . The whole cast play their roles superbly and contribute to the realisation of how mysterious and disconcerting Walters world has become. As the series draws to a close we see all of the characters in a very desperate place and we find ourselves gripped and stuck to our seats once again.

9.5/10

10.0,9 August 2010,
10.0,28 November 2011,"I have to share with you that this series is one of the most refreshingly unique and innovative ideas I have ever seen expressed in a TV drama. Walt, who is a chemistry teacher has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has to make sure he provides for his family including his pregnant wife Skyler and his son who has a disability. He decides to start making crystal meth with his accomplice, a former student called Jesse. The comedy is so dark, with each episode as Walt and Jess venture further and further into the scary world of illegal drugs the audience is left thinking, 'oh please don't do that - please don't do that!' and then they do. The series is not for the squeamish however, I agree with many others, it's just about the best thing that's been on TV, I am a huge fan and have just purchased series 2."
10.0,21 May 2021,Brilliant actor! Amazing plot! Cannot find anything wrong with this. Definetely the best show I have seen so far 10/10.

10.0,26 July 2017,"This year, 7 years after the ending of the series, I watched the entire 5 season series, and WOW... What a wild ride Breaking Bad is. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul's acting (as well as the main ensemble of actors on the show) made this show top notch, but the writing took it over the top and made it the platinum standard for all other shows. Breaking Bad is the ONLY show that has ever kept me on the edge of my seat throughout each one of its 80 episodes. Every single episode hits the mark, which I can imagine is very hard to achieve, even for some of the best shows on TV today. So if you've been thinking about starting BB, give it a try. Whether or not drug/crime related TV is your thing, look past the synopsis and you'll not be disappointed. But savor it, because the series is over and once it's gone, you can't get it back!"

10.0,4 February 2022,Breaking Bad is a very artistic saga about a brilliantly written Byronic hero. Vince Gilligan and gang are some of the best writers and directors for vary carefully displaying Walter on his path from good to evil and tricking the audience to relate to him the entire time.

The writing is beyond amazing. I could barely predict what's gonna happen. Even if I could, the way it happened wouldn't be the same as I thought It'd be. Yall did an incredible job!

Plus the acting just- wow! I almost forgot that it was just a movie. The more this story goes on, the better it gets. And that's rare.

To all of you who's reading this, If you haven't watch Breaking Bad- bruh, what have you done with your life? And for those who also loves Breaking Bad... You got high-quality standard, yo."
9.0,6 July 2013,"this is best TV show series movie I ever seen now 30 years old and there a lot of good ones... but this one goes much much further it goes couple levels higher than best movies ever like godfather... or Scarface and pulp fiction and it makes it even more awesome because it is a series so it has much more depth... its just perfect...

it has little things in it in which mostly you can see only in TV movies... it has some great effects of an action movie it has humor on it it has CHANGE you can really feel the change and the characters... the story the mystery and all main characters even smaller roles play excellent and have an own influence and most important of all.. it is the play between character... that it goes for all of them...

its true that it has some similarity's with the weeds... in story... but the whole directing the whole tone is set totally different... that I cannot compare it... with as far as I know there are none or few series like this and that makes it even more awesome some people try to compare it with prison break... mad man and dexter but it has nothing in common not even the level breaking bad is far beyond those the only one which could come close is Oz from tom Fontana only those 2 has such depth that it comes close to reality and still every actor seems to be in main role ...."

OMG, The errors that are made, all that nonsense that is said, it is boring, and how they make Walter look like the good guy is just SICKENING. It looks like they motivate people to make this choice. This is really disturbing. If u like this show, u will have to be a madman yourself. At least a little bit. I wish i could give this a 0/10. I really struggled to watch this show and it is most certainly the most awful show ever. U should never want to watch something like this. It can never be unseen, which is sad."

10.0,8 March 2021,
10.0,30 September 2023,"The Episodes are good but a couple of bad ones that are ranked too high . The fly terrible and the Los pollos flashbacks Hermanos blah. I love breaking bad but I think the wire even tops it . I can't binge breaking bad like I can the sopranos . I'm not trying to hate just to bring people back down to earth I've studied cinema since I was in diapers . While breaking bad he's a very great show , the writing and directing isn't as good so I have to rank breaking bad along with sons of anarchy and even the walking dead not trying to dissuade anyone from watching this series. But even Bryan Cranston admitted "" no Tony soprano = no Walter white """
10.0,18 March 2021,"I think it would be very difficult to create another series like this. Breaking Bad is the real essence of television's history. This is personally the very first series I really loved so much. Amazing because of the story, kept alive especially for the wonderful acting given by Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito and Jonathan Banks. Season by season this series always reaches higher levels. The negative note of this one is that you're attacked by a sense of nostalgia almost immediately after the series completely ended. I would reset my brain and rewatch this series from the beginning just to feel those emotions again."
10.0,3 June 2020,
10.0,9 January 2014,"Here's how to enjoy this to the maximum extent; 1,Sign up for Netflix one month free. 2.Visit the local hospital and steal a supply of liquid food with an intravenous drip 3. Get a trained professional to hook you up in the basement 4. unplug the phone 5.Start from the very first episode and don't leave until you're up to 2012 ('cos that's as far as it goes on Netflix) 6. Have your wife check in on you from time to time over the next three days to change the drip and give you a sponge bath. 7.prepare yourself to be a changed person when you re-enter society.

Quite simply one of the best series I have ever seen; acting superb on all fronts , plot and scripting brilliant, suspense tingling, scenery haunting. Can this really be the same guy we saw as a dentist on Seinfeld so many years ago? It's amazing how the absence of any sort of commercial break makes a show so much more enjoyable. You know maybe I can use Netflix to watch the Kardashians and Total Divas or even Jersey Shore.. I my have misjudged them just because of the intrusive advertisements... and then I woke up!"
10.0,19 February 2021,"What can I say? I'm only on season 2, I started two days ago but it's soo good. It's not the fastest pace but it's perfect. The actors are all really good, there's surprisingly a lot of comedy but it's not forced. Everything goes so natural it doesn't feel like you're watching a show. The plot is great too. I was worried it would be 70% him teaching a class and 30% cooking meth but so much happens. It's great really, I can't pin point what it is but I'm addicted"

10.0,9 October 2013,"The Breaking bad show has set a trend..this show created history in the TV series world. i have seen many TV-series..popular ones like Dexter, Mentalist, Bones, All started out good and ended a disaster...But breaking bad has never disappointed me.never in one episode..it always set my blood up high..and believe me..not everything impresses me. The character Heisenberg is a Kingpin in drug world..but he is shown like a normal guy..no big deal guy..a powerful guy..feels like a real alive character when all the way you see it..Bryan cranston is perfect match for the charactr..and all the episodes are carefullly written by the master writer Vince gillian..YOU CAN DEFINITELY WATCH IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PERFECT DRAMA WITH ENERGY..YOU CANT GET BETTER THAN THIS..I TRIED !!!"

10.0,25 February 2021,"Best TV show ever u could see in ur life, story is awesome, characters are unbelievable, end is fantastic."
10.0,5 December 2015,It's the best! I really liked it from the beginning but the end is amazing. Everyone should watch BB and i also thing many things in BB is how it could work with things like this so I would say it's realistic as well. I would say without spoiling anything that I change my minds about how I would end in every season. But I think one of the reasons I like it so much is how it ends. It has a good ending part. If a take Prison Break for an example I didn't like the end of it because it's not how it should end but BB isn't how it should end as well but it's still a really good end because it has to end sometimes or it just going to be a bad end anyway.
10.0,17 August 2021,"About me: series or movies I have rated highly (9 or higher) : 'Vivy: Fluorite Eye's Song ', 'Great Pretender', 'Messiah', 'The OA', 'Sense8', 'Beastars', 'Dark', and the movies 'Interstellar' and 'Arrival'.

It's a good quality show throughout all five seasons. It is fair and doesn't abuse cheap cliffhangers. It doesn't stall or use filler; it gets straight to the point. It manages to make sense throughout. It engages you as the characters make questionable and difficult choices throughout, challenging you as a viewer to make a judgment or form an opinion on their choices.

However, if I reflect on the show, the characters somehow feel unbelievable, and the story also somehow feels the same. Because of this 'not quite right', 'not quite realistic' feeling, the show feels a bit hollow.

It has some moments when the show seems to approach 'epicness' and 'greatness', but it rarely seems to reach those qualities. (The final episodes are very good, I can give you that.) There is a lot of tension and excitement throughout the series, but not many moments that 'shake you to the core' if you consider the number of episodes.

For these reasons, I am inclined to say that the show is 'skippable'.

One bonus advantage of the show is that it seems to make you familiar with the (under)world of drugs, and the mentality of the actors involved.

The show might deserve a 9, but I will be cautious and rate it with an 8 instead.

Conclusion: worth the watch if you are looking for a good, enjoyable, intelligent enough, and adrenaline pumping TV series to watch. But this is not the best choice if you want to watch the best show or a 'great show'. Also it is not a 'must watch'."
10.0,16 October 2013,"Here's a TV series I almost skipped, coz on paper it just didn't seem that interesting to me. I eventually I gave it a chance, and I'm sure glad I did. Although there were some quality dips during the run of the series it certainly has earned it's place as one of the most memorable series of all time. They were wise enough to create a 5 season story arc and give the characters a chance to come full circle. Maybe they've stopped at the height of their success, but it's a hell of a lot better then keep milking it season after season until it has bled dry like some other series did. Some people apparently were disappointed with the ending but I don't agree. Maybe people had such high expectations nobody was ever going to be able to match them. Following the 'bad guy' for 62 episodes was incredible fun and very addictive. If you haven't seen Breaking Bad (who hasn't?), give it a chance. You won't regret it!"
10.0,24 March 2021,"This show is one of the most amazing shows ever made. The constant ups and downs of crime and drama make it addicting. I've watched it over 6 times since it ended and I will watch it many more times.

The story of Walt is relatable, but also impossible. The need to provide for his family at all costs rings true to all of us in one way or another. Although he does what nobody else would dare do.

The imagery, themes, canon, and music in this show is just astounding. Watching it so many times is needed so you can pick up on all of the hidden messages sent to predict the ending.

This is a must watch. For real."
10.0,8 June 2020,"This is a decent show but 9.5/10? NO ""the greatest show of all time"" NO."
10.0,9 August 2020,"My experience with this show was underwhelming. It's so slow paced ...the scenes are stretched out and are boring. The shows writing stales quick ....it's centered around two characters doing the same thing for majority of the time. The duo isn't really entertaining enough for it. This show isn't really gripping but draggy with no twists. Also the style of the show is plain it's really not unique to me. Another problem for me is all the characters surrounding the main characters are underdeveloped some more than others. Basically, the show is filled with minor characters and I prefer well multiple well developed characters. Unfortunately female characters are not given the same agency as the male characters. In fact the females are defined by their male counterparts. Overall I just wasn't entertained by the show.

The things that I enjoyed was the realism but not much else."

9.0,15 March 2021,"The success of Breaking Bad is to have conjugated a closed and novel script (without fringes or weak points) with a cast characterized by an unequaled technical and creative level (very much to review the role of such successful castings). It is a perfect series from start to finish, the kind that can be repeated and repeated, and does not lose tension, emotion and unconditional attraction. This is the SERIES."
10.0,10 March 2021,"The show immediately grabs you from the get-go and enthralls you with its characters and conflicts. However, the first season may come off as cheesy and ""Hollywood"". As the show continues, it breaks away from these ""network"" TV constrictions and does what it wants. The show only gets better. Characters have subplots and development that all intertwine and affect each other. People say it is ""slow"" at some points, but every storyline builds toward EPIC climaxes that change the plot of the show entirely. Every episode matters. Storytelling at its ABSOLUTE finest.

The themes may be seen as weaker than other shows, like The Wire, but they are not absent. The driving theme, imho, is masculinity, and the positives and negatives of it. Pride, protection, justice, and humility. It all affects each character in different ways.

Walter White is not only a complex character, but a meta one as well. He is so well-made that I have yet to find a character in a show written as well. At first, he is quite simple. A good guy gone bad. But there is so much more to him that you may not notice. His motives, his pain, his hypocrisy, and the lies he tells himself, those around him, and the audience.

As I said, the show only gets better. Each season is better than the previous, ending on its highest note. NO OTHER SHOW that I have seen has done that.

Watch. This. Show. Anyone will enjoy it. Anyone. If someone does not like this show, they are one of two things: way to picky and pretentious, or very poor in taste. That may sound pretentious, but that's how good this goddamn show is. Watch it."

10.0,10 April 2023,"Look, it's ok, but there are so many perfect 10's and it is by no means that perfect, nor challenging. The Handmaid's Tale (different genre) scores 8.4, but so many of you guys score this one 10! Come off it! Production values, script and acting are all good enough, but you know it is not exactly thought provoking. Can you relate to anyone in this? Nah, not likely. Five seasons of this show, that's rather daunting and discouraging, so I cannot see myself staying for the long haul. There is indeed some humour but there are also long-winded long drawn-out scenes which border on tedious. 10's are incomprehensible, and I'll give it a reluctant 8, in fact assessing it more like a 7.5."

10.0,3 March 2021,"One of the best series, if not the best I've ever seen"
10.0,6 July 2012,"Many of you think Breaking Bad a dark comedy.

I, however, find nothing comedic about the nihilism of drug addiction beyond De Quincy. I saw enough of that in the Sixties, and it wasn't not hilarious then.

Neither do I consider the breakup of the family to be humorous. The absolute amorality of a man destroying other people to profit his own family is incomprehensible to me.

The wanton, pornographically lingering brutality, too, fails to elicit chuckles from me, what with the sundry decapitations, sliced carotid arteries, exploding heads, dissolution in various industrial chemicals, etc., ad nauseam.

As much as I enjoy the writing, acting, cinematography, plotting, and especially characterization of this series, I do so despite the brutalizing effect it has on viewers.

Perhaps I'm an anachronism, for I consider it a cautionary tale rather than a comedy of any shade."
10.0,26 June 2019,"It's a good show, but only the characters that are in ""the business"" are worth listening or watching to, I always skip the parts where they have family meetings or whatever, super boring and adds nothing to the actual story in my opinion."

This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.

now Em fan of Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul (yoo!!)..i love this TV Show!"
10.0,17 February 2022,"I'm not the type of person who watches series often. I feel like I kinda lose my time and prefer movies. This doesn't apply to Breaking Bad AT ALL.

I watched this in 4 months, which is a fast pace for me, and WOW, what a masterpiece! What should I mention first? Acting? The plot, which is SO well written? How the series make you see the main characters as normal people and make you relate to all of them with weird and interesting ways? How the director makes you feel what the characters feel, from pride to sadness to anger to awkwardness? And the ending, oh God the end is the best end I've seen in any movie or series. No questions left unanswered, everything wraps up so perfectly. The times I said out loud that the director and the script writer of the series are geniuses, and the times I said this series is the epitome of cinematic art, are seriously countless.

WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T.

My true rating is 9.5/10, (but couldn't use .5 so I rated it 9) and that's not 10 because I believe that music could be better. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad at all, I just think it could be better. Everything else is already PERFECT in my opinion."
10.0,17 May 2022,"I really liked it, it was recommended to me by my brother. I wish I saw it earlier. The finale left me speechless. Many shows suck at making endings but this was really good. I am pretty sure that this is the best tv show ever."

10.0,14 November 2011,"I just finished watching all 4 seasons in just under 3 days. I was totally addicted at first, somewhat lost my enthusiasm during the 3rd season, and regained it with the fabulous 4th season.

The writing is of the highest quality and the acting is exceptional. Bryan Cranston(Walter) and Anna Gunn(Skyler) are amazing. A special mention to Giancarlo Esposito(Gus) for one of the creepiest TV character ever.

It's nice that there is a main storyline linking all the seasons together. The main quest remains the same, and all the subplots revolve around it. Something Tim Kring was not able to do with Heroes for example.

The only critics I have (and it is the only one really, otherwise I would rate it 10/10) is that I found some of Walter's decisions rather foolish and hard to justify. Also, in a few episodes, montage was weak and didn't contribute to a satisfying pace.

I am now hooked on this series and can't wait to get my next fix in 2012 with season 5."
10.0,4 March 2014,"Breaking Bad

In my opinion, this is one of the best shows ever. The story it self is one off the best ridden scripts ever. It' so incredibly detailed. But not in annoying way,it certainly is not lengthy story or something like that. You constantly want to know what' going to happen in the next episode when you just finished one. It is highly addictive show. Ironic to be addicted to show that' about methamphetamine. It is very sensational show, from the beginning to the end. Even after it ends, you will still think about it. Even when you don' like the subject of the show, you will love this show. Bryan Cranston, is fantastic actor, one off the best there is in my opinion. He plays the main character so good that you almost forget it isn't real. You gotta watch this, for sure!!"
10.0,18 May 2021,Rewatching it for the 3rd time. Undoubtedly this is an impeccable masterpiece that nothing gonna beat it in the years to come.
10.0,12 July 2014,"Breaking Bad will never fail to surprise you. You will see some of the finest acting seen in a show by Bryan Cranston. You will also see the rise of Hollywood actor Aaron Paul. Breaking Bad breaks boundaries, the change of Walter White into one 'Heisenberg' is truly phenomenal. Every cast member is not only good but amazing. I cannot mention some villains to Walt and Jesse as it will ruin the experience, every villain makes you hate them but will possibly make you root for their purpose because Vince Gilligan presents why each villain does what they do. Season one and two may seem slow but all will come together as season three, four and five will make the show tense, gripping, shocking and yet so enjoyable. So if you don't find the start to be of your taste continue to watch and the wait will be worth it! This show is simply the best.

All Hail The King,Walter White."
10.0,6 February 2015,"After watching entire 62 episodes for the third time, it is time for me to write a tribute to the greatest TV show ever. I was reading some reviews on the site and very few of them had one star and even those small population of reviews instantly and immensely pained me. It got me to think how you will always have a section of people who cannot bring themselves to like even the best things in life. Such reviews are really sad. And this show does not deserve anything less than 10/10.

This TV show is epic - well written, well acted and well edited. It is Shakespearean. It is an instant classic. From the first episode to Felina - gripping, endearing and loftiest style of story telling. Memorable performances by the actors that will get permanently etched into your memories. No amount of hype does justice to the sheer brilliance of this show.

This show should be on everybody's ""Things to do before I die"" list. Do yourself a favor, go watch it. I'm onto my 4th round."

10.0,17 June 2014,"This TV show was the very first thing to get me seriously interested in cinematic glory. It's perfect script, amazing acting, and stellar cinematography leave me knowing that without a doubt this show will be remembered through history. Every episode leaves you thirsty for more and willing to choke someone with a bike lock to get it. With each season the epic tale of walter white gets increasingly better. I applaud every single person who worked on this show and I hope it's spin off can bring me as much love as breakingbad did.

The story gives you a dramatic look into the life of a dying man, who knows that very soon he will die, leaving nothing to his family. This drives him to become the greatest drug dealer that ever lived and his greed leads to the very fall of his empire, and it is shown to you in such elegance that I can help but believe it to be the greatest piece of cinematic glory to come to your TV."
10.0,7 April 2022,"Brilliant show to watch. Storyline is incredible and the directors really know how to put on a show.

I'd advise you to watch this first, then El Camino then Better Call Saul."
10.0,2 March 2022,Breaking bad has a depressing and slow start and Walter is the embodiment of that. As the story progresses we slowly see how that changes. The writing is phenomenal and unexpected just as you expect one thing to happen another thing happens. This show destroys your understanding on how shows work and after watching it you never view the art of tv the same. The cast is amazing to the point we love and hate every single character at the same time and they all seem so human and real to the point you get pulled into the show and it's like you are actually there. Phenomenal series 10/10.

You will be hooked right away and find yourself wanting to watch episode after episode! Everything about this show is excellent! Bryan Cranston is sensational, his acting is one of the best performances I have ever seen! The character he plays, Walter White, becomes one of the greatest television show characters of all time! Even though Walter White does a lot of bad things, you will be rooting for him the entire time! Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman, is Walter Whites partner in crime and you will love him and hate him equally! I had never heard of Aaron Paul until I watched this show and I was so impressed with how great his acting was! There are so many other great characters in this show that you will love! I do not want to give away any spoilers so take my word for it and go and watch every episode, this show is a must see!

I give Breaking Bad a 10 out of 10 Acting: A+ Story/Writing: A+ Characters: A+ Ending: A+"
10.0,14 December 2013,"I hadn't heard of this TV show until pretty recently and have already finished it. It was an absolutely amazing show and its such a shame it ended, in fact I think it is the best TV show ever to have been made (and I consider myself a pretty harsh critic).

This show has is amazingly entertaining through the combination of a breath taking story with a sense of authenticity in all the little details to the major plot line, so all in all you will be simply astounded with the execution of such a eccentric chain of events that transpires through the entire show.

In one sentence Breaking Bad is why the television was invented, you simply cannot watch one episode without having that addictive sensation that forces you to sit for hours watching every episode in every season."
10.0,11 September 2022,"AMAZING

Saul Goodman He is one of the characters who made Breaking Bad funnier. Especially with his two guys, Huel and Kuby. Saul's mouth is just like any lawyer in general, good with words. At first, he seems dangerous for Walt's drug operation, but in a matter of fact, he helped Walt and Jesse so much. Anyways his role in Breaking Bad could be more developed, but probably that's why there is a spin-off about him, Better Call Saul.

Marie Schrader

Marie's role is kind of underappreciated by Breaking Bad fans. But that's understandable because she barely got her important moments as a character. It was unfortunate as a regular character in the show from day one. In her few moments, she successfully gave this show an emotional element especially when she reacted to the situation regarding Hank. Her moments with her sister also created more depth for Skyler.

Tuco Salamanca

The first villain for Walt and Jesse. Only one word can describe his character, wild. His behavior was very unpredictable. He was so easy getting temperamental and he didn't hesitate to beat his men for no reason. His first appearance was the brutal side of the drug business. The way he talks made everyone don't want to be in the same room with him. Salamanca's family is not the right people to be messed with.

Mike Ehrmantraut

Mike is proved how good the writing of Breaking Bad is. The show's decision to give Mike more depth, instead just showing him as a random hitman is made his character feel real. He already showed up in the second season but did not get much exposure until the last season. His connection with Saul Goodman was interesting to watch, there is some history between them that is interesting to explore in Better Call Saul.

Gus Fring

He is the main villain in Breaking Bad. Also, he is the scariest and most dangerous person throughout the seasons. Gus made the tension escalate when Jesse and Walt had a conflict with him. Gus's power in the show is incredible, a famous person with the most innocent looking in public. Then we got his backstory with the Cartel which made us feel odd because we had some kind of empathy for this guy. His last moment is so badass.

Skyler White

Some people are probably annoyed by Skyler's character because of her conflicted heart. But that's made her character how normal person reacts to what Walt did. Skyler and Walt are similar, they are selfish on some points. That made their communication is so problematic and put their family harmony in a bad way. Skyler has a lot of moments that show how good Anna Gunn is as an actress.

Jesse Pinkman

Jesse is the most destroyed person in the show. Since season one, Walter White never stopped manipulating him and made him in a lot of low points. But he had an ups and down relationship with Walt. Sometimes Jesse sees Walt as his tutor or even father figure since his real father ignored him. Every moment with Jesse is almost always depressing. Jesse and Walt are the best interaction and relationship that this show gave.

Hank Schrader

Hank's mission to put Heisenberg in jail made the show feel so exciting. The fact that the person whom he looking for is his brother-in-law made him in a unique position. From the first episode to his last episode we could watch how he turned from a cheerful uncle to a grumpy serious officer. If we compare his facial expression from season 1 and season 5 we could know he through a lot of stress, anger, and disbelief.

Walter White

The man behind the chaos. A normal chemistry teacher became a drug lord mastermind. Walter is the example of a best-written character ever in the history of television/series. His transformation from boring Walter White to heartless Heisenberg put us in a lot of shock in the entire series. Kill after kill he did make his eyes blinded by blood and his mind only thinking of winning without caring about the cause of it.

10.0,8 May 2021,"Amazing show. I will guarantee you, that you'll like it no doubt. What are you waiting for go watch it!"
10.0,14 January 2021,Anyone watching this would thoroughly enjoy the fascinating plot.
10.0,24 December 2011,"If I like a show I'll watch 2 or 3 episodes on the spin. With this I somehow have gone through 3 full series in three days! I had work the next morning and my wife had to call me to bed at 2.00am. I didn't realise how long I had been watching it.

The acting is brilliant, the way the show 'teases' you with images you just know are going to make sense sometime is brilliant.

The humour is very dark in the early seasons and it is a thriller first and foremost, but you will laugh out loud on occasion.

As a Brit I have to say some of the US series are very overrated but this one isn't.

The best thing about BB is that it's completely unpredictable. As soon as you try and second guess it, it takes you somewhere else. To an even better place. Something only brilliant writing can do.

The finale of Season 4 almost made me cry. Not because it was particularly sad in any way...but because it was so brilliant. I think I was a bit sad as I knew I would probably never see something so good again.

The good news is Season 5 (the final season) is outstanding too (at the 7th episode point).

Get yourself the complete set and sit down and prepare to curse eating, bowel movements and sleeping as they stop you on your BB marathon.

If I could have my memory erased I would remove BB from my mind so I could start again.

I am so jealous of you if you are about to start watching Season 1 for the first time."
10.0,16 June 2014,"This show is simply flawless!!! They have picked brilliant actors who were really amazing!!! None of them were famous but they gave a magnificent performance, better than many Hollywood actors!! Especially Aaron Paul, he came from nowhere but amazed everybody!! His astonishing performance made us laugh,and even cry!! I think he is a very talented actor who deserves a 3rd Emmy, better than all the other nominees! As a conclusion, This show really deserves a 10.0 evaluation!!

P.S: Thanks for Vince Gilligan for creating this wonderful show!! It is the most brilliant show I have ever seen in my entire life! I hope {Better Call Saul} be just as wonderful as this show is!!"
10.0,14 July 2011,"Breaking Bad is simply brilliant, there is no other way to describe this show. It is the best acted show currently on TV and maybe all-time. There are not enough words to describe Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White. His 3 emmy's speak for itself. Just like Vic Mackey on The Shield, the protagonist is becoming the antagonist but you continue to root for the guy. Aaron Paul has been unbelievable as his side kick Jesse and in my opinion gave a better performance during the ground breaking 3rd season. The concept and plot may initially turn you off but if you enjoyed The Wire, Sopranos, Mad Men, or The Shield then I guarantee you will enjoy this show. It may not be at The Wire and The Soprano's level yet, but one more season of greatness will put it right in the pantheon of dramas."
10.0,27 September 2013,
10.0,30 September 2020,After finishing watching this series I can't stop thinking about it wondering how a smart and innocent-looking teacher could simply turn into a perfect criminal. The cast is great. every actor is well fitted into the character. The storyline blows your mind away with all those nuances used to develop the characters step by step. If only I had the time to watch it again! But I'm sure to me Breaking Bad is like a criterion to assess other series.
10.0,29 December 2014,"No doubt it is the best TV series.The story really touches our heart. The first season was a worthy start.We come to know about Walter White,the man with the Chemistry High School Teacher-cum-""The man who knocks"". The second season unfolds the story ,while the third,fourth and fifth season will keep you rooted to the spot .The last 3 seasons brings out other lead characters like Saul Goodman,Mike Ehrmantraut,Hector Salamanca,Todd Alquist etc.Vince Gilligan was the mastermind and really did a great job.Now talking about the actors Bryan Cranston(Walter White),Aaron Paul(Jesse Pinkman) and Anna Gunn(Skyler White) was at their career best while Bob Odenkirk(Saul Goodman),Giancarlo Esposito(Gustavo Fring),Jonathan Banks(Mike Ehrmantraut) were awesome. I cried as the series ended and badly wanted for more seasons to come. It's a must watch for everyone and I hope you will enjoy the 'nail-biting' episodes. Thank you !"

10.0,2 July 2020,I tried to get over with this show but it's not letting me . The only thing I ever wish is to get brain wished and enjoy this show right from the start.
9.0,1 September 2014,"When talking about TV shows Breaking Bad is bound to be mentioned. Why? Because its unlike anything else on TV, the acting is better in this TV show, than quite a lot of movies, combined. The writers thought out every last detail, and made a compelling, incredibly acted TV show, that you will never forget after watching it.

I usually don't follow trends/popular TV shows and such, and I had heard of Breaking Bad, but never really paid much mind to it, and thought to myself ""why is this show so popular"". So a friend of mine said it was awesome, so I gave it a shot. One season became 2, then 3 Until I finished it. It is truly an experience, and a roller coaster ride of emotions. The acting is incredible, as is the writing and directing. Just an amazing show that needs to be seen. -10/10"
10.0,15 January 2021,"One of the best tv shows ever I can't get enough from watching it , it's my fourth time now lol"
10.0,31 May 2021,Get to watch this masterpiece after 8 years of its release.
10.0,22 September 2020,It's the conflict in protagonist external and internal character which binds audience and show. No body will look at Walter white and believe what he could do infact during the series his character developed more into single persona. Like series showed us how two different person in the same person became one
9.0,26 February 2021,"A great show. Season 2 was sort of boring. They should have made the transition towards selling to Gus faster. Anyways, love face off! The best episode hands down"
10.0,20 May 2021,Watched 2 times. U may find boring at the start and between the episodes its slow somewhere but terrific ending . Walter white and pinkman and their character development is awesome.
10.0,10 August 2014,"Usually I don't write reviews , but after watching this TV series twice i was bound to write this review. I 've tried to keep it short. The season 1 starts with our 'HERO' Walter white and his sidekick Jesse pinkman struggling with their daily lives. Then Mr.white gets to know about his cancer and he decides to break bad after suffering all of his life . In the process he befriends Jesse pinkman and starts to cook meth( This is the base plot. No spoilers.). In this process several situations are faced by our hero and his family. With many hilarious situations and thrilling twists we watch this show called 'Breaking Bad'.

SCREENPLAY AND WRITING: This is the strongest part of the show. Attention is given to every minute details. Very strong detailing . The chemistry part of the show is also very accurate. The creator Vince Gilligan along with the other writers has written some fantastic stuff. The best since 'The Sopranos'. The actors get to perform to their peak because of the tight writing . The stories are very relate able to our real lives, you can feel the helplessness of Mr.white or the agony of Jesse. Simply outstanding. I have to mention the episode 'Ozymandia', its insanely brilliant , i've watched the episode like 50 times( Seriously , i'm not exaggerating). The first two seasons are for story building and character build up. The real havoc starts from third season . Each is multiplying brilliant than its previous. I mean it. The writing is so strong that every episode grows on you, though you have to patient in the first two seasons but you are waiting for fireworks ,sister! There are some insanely funny scenes which nicely blends with the drama.

ACTING: Well what can i say about it , its the best i've seen on the television. Bryan Cranston has got into my list of top 10 actors . I cant imagine anyone playing Walter White except him. The transition of a good family man to a bad-ass drug lord , Cranston makes it believable. It seems that he is unapologetic of his actions but deep inside he is guilty. Each and every reaction of his under any circumstances is just so unreal i'll say , the way he does it ,its, its just (every positive superlatives in the dictionary). Now we come to Jesse Pinkman played by Aaron Paul ,my favorite character. Paul is so good that he will make you fall in love with Jesse . The way he burst out his angst , his agony , his sorrows , his loneliness is commendable , he deserves every allocades for his work . The chemistry between Mr.White and Jesse is a delight to watch. In some scenes Aaron makes look Cranston an average actor (yes he is that good) . Their complex relation gets even complex with each season . They are a delight. Then there is Anna Gunn playing Skylar White. Man she is damn hot!!! But she is a hotter actress. She completes Walter white ,without her white is very much incomplete. In the emotional scenes she is the one to beat (Paul is equally good). There are dozen of actors who should get a description like this,but it would be very exhaustive process. But i would like to tell you they are equally good as Cranston, Paul and Anna.

FINAL VERDICT : I could discuss a 100 page review with you all , that much i've to say for it. I would say i m addicted to it . Yes , it is the best show ever , though i've not seen all the shows, but i don't need to . I can guarantee you , you have not experienced something this never before and never will you after this. It will grow on you like a virus. Specially the last season is a blockbuster, and the finale is ... Man i've no words. Please watch it . You'll regret it for your whole lifetime if you wont watch it. You are in for a cracker. Hope you all will find this review helpful."
10.0,28 June 2020,"This is hands down the best crime drama series I have ever seen. From the writer to the actors and directors, all did a phenomenal job in making this series intriguing. The story plots and twists in between the scenes was marvelously portrayed. Overall felt little nervous as the series concluded after 5 seasons, I was thriving for more!

However, then Vince Gilligan surprised the fans by introducing Better Call Saul with the stories connecting with Breaking Bad which makes this series even more appealing. Hats off to the production team! 👏"
10.0,10 September 2012,"I hadn't watched this show until I heard Louis Ferreira was going to be in it. He is the best actor, and if they keep him on the show, I will be watching every week. Louis is the most gifted and talented actor ever. I can vision his character being just what the show needed, to take them to the next level. Louis can accelerate this show to the top of its potential. If you were a fan of the show before Louis, just wait, you haven't seen anything yet. He will blow your mind, and nobody could play this type of role better than him. To all you Louis fan's, I know you all feel as strongly about him as I do. Good call BB casting! Your lucky to have him. Treat him right!"
10.0,14 May 2020,"I've seen many many movies and series and this one.. this one tops them all.

The acting is so heart crushingly good, the cast is amazing and born for their roles. Every character has meaning,symbolism, a story in their own right. The characters are a match made in.. hell. It's literally a perfect cast with the best acting I've seen in my life. I felt every emotion under the sun because of the performances.

The story is literal gold. It has so much foreshadowing, and symbolism that Its just beautiful in a sick kinda way. They will be talking about this for a century, this should be a example in film schools for how to write a story. It's so gripping, interesting and sad mixed with a million other things that make it so enticing to watch.

I just can't even put into words how good this series is. It's the best I've ever seen and probably will ever see. Story,acting,characters,symbolism,emotion,charisma,foreshadowing,cinematography.. its all 10/10. I highly encourage you to look at videos people make at dissecting this artwork of a series. Theres so much hidden stuff you dont even realize and its awesome.

Well what are you waiting for? This is the best show out there, hands down. Go ahead and watch it because all the hype you've heard about this is true."
10.0,7 November 2011,"My guess is yes definitely. It's a brilliant piece of art, nasty and extremely shocking. I watched the first Season and I thought, yeah well, it's awesome, but I think Dexter is still better. Then I watched the second Season and was like, alright then, but I think the second Season of Dex was still a bit better. But then with the third Season and thing became sure. This Show is better than Dexter. Beter than every Series I've ever seen. But finally after thinking it can't get more thrilling, the fourth Season came along and blew my mind in every Episode. These perfectly worked out Characters this visual brilliance, this extremely convincing story. The way this writers made you love and hate all the Characters at the same time. And of course, the unbelievable shocking events of the final Episode of Season IV that blew my mind and left me in a numb mood that least for hours. Amazing, f***ing Amazing!"
9.0,13 December 2012,
10.0,30 May 2020,"This series couldn't have been any better. Strong cast, personalities you like then loathe, it has it all. Plus lots of meth! I have seen Breaking Bad 5 times and each time something happens I must have missed.

It's a must watch again before you watch the Breaking Bad movie, El Camino."
10.0,24 May 2021,"Very entertaining & funny. Some of the situations they find themselves in are a little outrageous at times, but it keeps you glued to the screen. You won't want to miss an episode."
10.0,7 February 2015,"I've watched thousands of movies and TV shows and have to admit, some of them were really great. However; I've never written a review for any of them, watched without sleeping for days, listened the soundtrack, classified a TV show as a movie, watched youtube videos of it's characters and yeah, never written RIP for Walter White!!!! Breaking Bad is a punch in your face. You'll question whats good and bad in life and it will affect your reasoning. Breaking Bad will touch you one way or another, and you'll never forget.

I no longer enjoy watching a TV show or a so called great movie. Nothing thrills me anymore. Nothing keeps me idle for whats next. Nothing does touch actually. After watching top 100 movies, the top TV shows and many other crap, I can undoubtedly say that it's the greatest production of all times."
10.0,13 May 2014,"The best series of all time, almost with no negatives, almost PERFECT!!! The first season was good, well represented what was upcoming to the viewers. The second season was simply amazing to the point that I would never imagine that would be better. Then came the third season, better and stronger than the second, mostly due to the Cousins presence, and Hank's evolution, allied to the amazing Gus Fring. Then four season perplexed me with the first episode ""Box Cutter"" and as well the last, ""End Times"". To end, the fifth season was perfect, no negative points, it was completely perfect, Todd's presence and development, as well the Jack's White Supremacy Gang and Lydia was the strongest points of the season, developing a plot better and better with Hank, Jesse and Mr White. The episodes ""Gliding Over All"", ""To'Hajiilee"", ""Ozymandias"", ""Granite State"" and ""Felina"" proved that Breaking Bad was the best series of all time."
9.0,12 December 2013,"Like i was watching an ancient Greek drama!! I want to express so many feelings that i have inside me,since i finished the series,but my English are awful!! When i finished the 1st season,i said ,OK,good,lets see the 2nd season,even if i don't understand all this noise for this series...When i finished the 2nd season,i said,OK a little bit better,but still...After the 3rd season,i was anxious to see the 4th,which was great!!When i was watching the 5th,especially the last 8 episodes,i was sad,because i knew that this masterpiece is going over!!And its over with the most wonderful finale!And then,all the pieces from every season,they took place in my mind!!Sad because its over...happy because i saw this perfection!! THANK you creators for this wonderful TV experience!!"
10.0,29 December 2013,"Hands-down the best acting I have ever seen in a TV drama series. Each actor and actress plays their role terrifically and really achieves exactly what the creators wanted each on of them to achieve. That is to make the viewers fall in love with the cast. The show also does an extremely stellar job in grabbing the viewers, pulling them in, and never, I say never letting them go! Closely, but better in my opinion, resembles The Walking Dead. I honestly cannot think of an episode that didn't end making me immediately want to jump into the next episode. In my opinion, that is exactly what a TV drama is supposed to do. Breaking Bad is dramatic, suspenseful perfection. 10/10!"
10.0,12 January 2014,"The Best TV-Series there is and the best there ever Will be. Heisenberg 4ever. Too bad you can not assign note 100, and therefore assign the maximum possible, namely, note 10. Thank entire personnel that kept me breathless throughout the period of the five seasons. Maybe it should not continue with the other 5 seasons. Or who knows? Kudos too, to creator Vince Gilligan to have the courage to end the show at just the right time rather than string it out past where the story would bear. It may take a few episodes to get into, but you owe it to yourself to try. This is powerful, important and utterly enthralling stuff. But believe in one thing: this series can make us chase dreams that we would have not invested or may just be time well spent but it makes us realize that it is not necessary to be born in a slum to be a criminal. And do not say that it is something that is born with us: We can all Break Bad ."
10.0,28 March 2014,"This is an outstanding piece of work.The direction, the screen play , actors everything is just amazing.Every episode was just great and not a single wrong chord was stuck.To be glued to it is an under statement from my part.

The climax , the way characters have been sketched was just mind blowing.I was sad that it ended but every good thing comes to an end and that was the best part of the show that it was not stretched.It was such a great end to the show.

In today's world there are so many form of entertainment and you have so many choices.Why do i watch a TV show and what makes me write a review for that show? Because I have never seen something like this. May be I have seen less !"
8.0,13 January 2021,"Any chance I can erase my brain and watch it again this how brilliant this show is , unique they would make something even close to breaking bad ."
10.0,25 May 2021,"Amazing show,great actingvand content. Bryan has really stole the show nd amazing cooperation with Aaron Paul."
10.0,12 January 2014,
10.0,27 September 2013,"Growth. Decay. Transformation. This is the foundation on which the show built it's own empire. The tale of an ordinary man and his death sentence. From the beginning, it is clear that the protagonist you're watching won't have a happy ending. Viewers were just not sure how severe on the spectrum that judgment would fall. However, as much as the show is praised for it's unique story telling, characters, and acting, the real prize for fans is in the details. Breaking Bad's success is fueled by its re-watch-ability as viewers will continue to find countless connections and theories. Although most of these are a product of over analyzing, there is still enough to make you question legitimately whether these clues were on purpose. I give it a perfect score. There are hundreds of reviews that do the same. You have to agree with the rest of us, it just feels so good to be bad."
8.0,21 September 2020,Best series Especially the fourth and fifth season
10.0,17 May 2014,
8.0,18 February 2021,"There are just two series so worth watching: this, and the Wire. The main characters are totally anti-heros and almost pitiful, there is a lot of violence, and some scene are Tarantino-worthy. Is disruptive. BUT... you can't stop to binge watching it. Just genius. In all is shades. Brilliant the soundtrack, the mixture of emotions, the dialogues. It's a slow excruciating and torturing crescendo until the last final episode that just keep you glued to the screen. It makes you wanna scream, cry, swear. And if you have the chance to watch it all over again....You'll do it. Brilliant."
9.0,19 March 2020,"There a zillion reviews on this show , but to sum up this is a masterpiece a once in a lifetime show

What Godfather is to films this show is the father of TV shows ."
10.0,22 November 2020,"The best show ever no one can disagree , I watched it like for five times i cant stop from watching this show"
8.0,25 December 2015,"The best story builds up and characters making that I ever seen. Firstly, I didn't like it too much. I liked it. But not much. But from the fourth season, I was getting interested in it. I really like the way that Vince Gilligan build up the characters as well as the story. It's really seamless. You can't think what's gonna happen next. I really liked it.

And the next main thing is I don't count Walter White as a villain. He is sort of a Hero as my point of view. He is a coward, selfish & A- hole as well. But he is one of my heroes.

Jesse Pinkman is my favorite character along all of them. Because he is the most innocent guy in the entire show. He is trying to keep peace every time. But I really like the dialogs of Saul Goodman. The every single word of this show is from Vince Gilligan's mind. That was remarkable.

The second main thing is the editing style of it. As a video editor, I learned so many things from this. I've watched some scenes again and again. Still, I can watch them.

America is a great country and a Worst country. And my dream country. America is suffering from this kind of diseases. And America helps for those who raised their hands for against them in every possible way."
10.0,25 October 2013,"I'll tell you now, if you start with episode one, you won't be able to stop, it will just sink your whole day away. Absolutely amazing show, great acting and superb story. Prepare for a fantastic ride! I started watching the show when season 5 began. And within the start of season 5 episode one, I was caught up and watching episode five on TV. I was hooked from start to finish. The acting all the way through the show was great. Right up to the very end of the show I guarantee you will be craving more and more and never want it to end, but sadly, every show has to end at some point and instead of drawing it out and possibly making the story become boring and dull they finished it with an absolute perfect finale. Thank you so much Breaking Bad for giving me some great memories due to watching your show."
10.0,24 May 2014,
10.0,10 January 2021,"This series is a masterclass in acting, cinematography, direction, writing and editing. I have never felt so satisfied after finishing a series. The character development , attention to detail, the twists and turns and an ending with no loose ends makes make it the best series ever."
10.0,28 February 2022,"Breaking bad is absolutely brilliant, my favourite show of all time. I don't know how many time's I've watched it, always as good as the first time.

Don't know what else to say just wanted to give it 10 stars because they deserve it."
10.0,28 March 2015,"This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!! 10/10 Masterpiece"
10.0,22 August 2014,
10.0,29 January 2012,"okay, so recently i was recommended a show. it was called dexter. i got so hooked on it that watched the first 5 seasons in 5 days. 12 hour a day sessions. i was like seriously hooked on it. once that finished i decided it was the best show i had ever seen... the same man who recommended that show then said ""watch this""... and gave me seasons 1-4 of breaking bad. ""its the dad from malcolm in the middle being a bad ass..."". i was sceptical to say the least. i stuck it on and watched the first 3 eps. it was OK, but seemed a little disjointed. but i persisted and am so pleased i did. because after that it just took off. had me totally hooked. cranstan is just brilliant as the chemic genius walter white. but he is backed up by the even better arron paul as the street wise yet quite stupid jesse pinkman. the chemistry (excuse the pun) between the two is incredible and you get engrossed in the relationship that develops between the two as much as you do with the story itself. brilliantly written. beautifully acted. and dare i say... better than dexter... pfffffft..... its a bold statement but i think it may be you know... :)"
10.0,7 July 2020,"I first came across this show when I first got Netflix about 5 years ago because I was only 12 when it was actually being broadcasted on television and plus it wasn't really on British television, but I'm grateful every time I go back and start watching it all over again because it's just one of those things: you HAVE TO watch it! With Bryan Cranston being a comedy actor you wouldn't expect it to work with its dark, deep seated dramatic nature but it does! He IS Heisenberg!! Then there's Jesse who is probably the character I relate to most, the young mistreated, misguided tortured soul who has no one to care about him and as a result he always seeks solitude and connection with the wrong people or actions. I believe every character is relatable in at least some way. The pacing of the show is also absolutely spot on. Walters secret becomes known to Skylar in perfect timing but we didn't expect it because HE didn't tell her! She told HIM she knew and that came as such a shock because I thought she thought he was having an affair. It's just so well written and put together, I would give anything to have Walter White survive the finale so we could have another series like how prison break did because it just feels like it could have so much more avenues to explore.

Though I don't think we will, I'll just have to keep rewatching it over and over again, I started again about a week ago and I think this is the 10th or 11th time I have done so ( I know I'm either obsessed or addicted right? )

That's just it though! It is so well written and acted that it's as addictive as the drug it's based on. You just can't turn your back on the characters you fell in love with from the first time.

Trust me if you haven't watched this yet and you're dwindling around STOP kidding yourself and jump on the BB bandwagon because unlike most pathetic people who think they're part of something special just because they watch that stupid RU Paul's drag race rubbish or whatever that's just about people with major mental health problems who need professional therapy and help, THIS is actually a part of popular culture that you SHOULD be a part of!

Not for the squeamish. However it serves as a good deterrent for getting involved in the drug world, not just meth."
10.0,24 June 2020,In my opinion if you have patience for first two seasons then you're going to be more than satisfied with what it has to offer next.
10.0,27 August 2014,"It doesn't happen very often that I'm not sad when a TV show ends: I'm not sad just because Breaking Bad could not have been done better. There are 5 season, and each one is good. They succeeded in keeping an high level for the whole TV show duration. It is never expect, never trivial. There are no good or evil men, no black or white, but everything is gray, every character is perfectly built. Bryan Cranston...what could I say? I think him to be one of the most talented actors in the world. You don't know if to love or to hate him. The most part of today TV shows are full of nudity, violence etc., but Breaking Bad had a great success also without these elements: there should be a reason, don't you think? If you want to find out what it is, just watch it, you will not regret this! Enjoy it!"
10.0,28 September 2013,
10.0,9 October 2014,"I usually don't write reviews, but I felt i HAD to for this epic series. For the past 3 years my brother has been bugging me to watch Breaking Bad, and finally I got around to it after moving to a Greek island, thus having more free time on my hands. All I can say is WOW. I can't believe what I missed the past 5 years! After watching the full 5 series in less than 2 weeks, I was left speechless after most episodes, and wanted more, sometimes taking me into the night until 2-3 am. Every episode is brilliantly written, directed, & produced. What can I say about the acting? Every single actor in this series deserves the highest awards. This show will go down as one of the all time greatest (if not THE BEST). HEISENBERG forever!"
10.0,11 November 2013,"I am not exaggerating, this show will go down as one of the best shows ever. Try to point out a flaw? It has the best writing I have ever seen. It has amazing and interesting characters who you get connected to. I am very sad that there will never be another episode of this series. It is a gem. A show like this comes around only once in a lifetime. Don't miss out on this opportunity, watch this show! A show about meth? How do you like that? I wondered the same thing before I began to watch it. After a few episodes you will realize that it is much, more than that. Experience the ""growth, decay, and transformation,"" of Walter White AKA Heisenberg. Witness the great tale about the family man chemistry teacher who broke bad!"
10.0,30 May 2021,"When I start this series I thought it's just a good series with high rating, but now in the end I think it is the best series that I ever have seen. All of the episodes were wonderful & finished very well."

10.0,25 July 2015,"IMDb is a excellent page but the problem is that a lot of people who like the other highest TV dislike pretty much the series, how is possible that Breaking Bad have under 8/10 episodes?...

Fly is maybe The worst episode but this series really have a bad episode, i'm not saying that 7 is bad number for the series but how is possible that One Minute have 8,8? really....well? 9,9 is the minimum...

IMDb users have at lest watch the series, if this page keep going on like this, for me is not what i'm looking for. it's a reall shame because is a page who has everything for a good review."
10.0,12 March 2014,"Breaking Bad is my favorite show, and in my opinion, one of the best TV shows ever. This show has been made from the ground up to create something so amazing, that it's going to get a prequel some time this year to keep things going. Basically, it's like nothing is going to stop the train (you'll get that reference later).

The character development in this show is mind-blowing. It can make a completely sane person in the show go into a deep state of depression, or someone who is a horrible person who has done horrible things. Yes, that's an important factor in any show, but in this show, you get to compare these characters from the beginning of the series to the final season and not recognize them. Not only physically, but in their emotional state, as well. The story plays a much more important factor in that, as well. So many plot twists, and so much creativity that you just wish other shows were just like this one. After you're done watching this, you'll be left wanting more. It's basically like drugs.

Overall, this show is what other shows strive to become. It excels in everything; the story, the characters, the depth, EVERYTHING. With this, I can proudly say that this is the best show AMC has ever had. Yes, it beats The Walking Dead, and yes it beats Mad Men."
10.0,3 July 2020,"At first I kept delaying this series because it had lot of episodes,but after I completed the whole series. I couldn't compare any other series with this,they were of no match the brilliant acting by Bryan Cranston and Arron Paul . After finishing the series I couldn't watch any other series for some time and just kept watching Breaking bad for second time then watched 'better call saul' prequel of Breaking bad.But this series is just irreplaceable and no other series is been neither a match nor close to Breaking bad.Breaking bad always stays on top of my list of best web series I have watched. No offence to any other series fans I just reviwed on my opinion I liked breaking bad more than any other series."
10.0,17 July 2014,"For at least a year I had people coming up to me and trying to talk about Breaking Bad. I said yeah yeah, sounds great but it's not a pay channel - therefore there's no nudity, gore and F bombs. Not for me. Boy, was I wrong.

This show is so good you don't mind the slight censorship. There's enough swearing, chicks and blood to satisfy you. We all know that Bryan Cranston knocked his role out of the park, but he's not the only one. I loved his brother in law and Aaron Paul was really, really good. Jonathan Banks was super as well.

This is the only show where I can say that I got a big kick out of every single episode. It's like the writers know what you want to see and they bring it every time. Not too much, not too little, just the perfect pacing for a story. I was sorry to see it end."
9.0,1 February 2021,Breaking bad great and good ever the best. Okay bye
10.0,14 April 2011,"This is my first review, however I thought I had to mention what a great show this really is! The first season is great, the second, in my opinion, is probably even better, and the third season is a little slower but some of the episodes are especially well written and acted. The way the characters develop throughout the show is nothing short of a masterpiece. The acting is top drawer. I never really rated Bryan Cranston before I saw him in this show. However I obviously overlooked what an amazing actor he really is. Aaron Paul as well plays the role brilliantly and provides a stunningly powerful performance, especially in season 2. To anyone reading this who is hoping to stumble across a GREAT show and hasn't decided whether they should give this show a go, all I have to say is please do, you will not regret it. Unfortunately this show has been slow to come onto UK TV, but this is probably THE best American TV show I have watched. Its better than any film because the characters are truly given time needed to develop."
10.0,5 August 2014,"Why you ask? Because it had me hooked from the start. I just finished watching it over for the second time. And still, knowing what was going to happen, I could not wait for the next episode.

Sure it's not for everyone.. If you'd rather have an action packed show filled with gun fights and tits in your face, this isn't for you. But when you do have the patience and understand what's going on.. This show will not disappoint you.

Characters are very well acted out by the very good actors. You really feel for them. Whether they do good or wrong. They had me hating some people on the show with so much passion.. My point, you can really get in to it. Relate with them.

If you haven't seen the show yet, I'm jealous because you're in for one hell of a ride. Definitely a must see show!"
10.0,29 June 2021,If you didn't watched it till now. You are missing something.
10.0,8 March 2020,"OK so im late to the party so lets try to bullet point it. * One of those ""i will watch it soon"" series for years. * Same as Better Call Saul * Noted BCS was a prequel to BB so tried BCS first, managed 5 episodes and slated it, 2 stars. * Was going to give up on BB but sometimes prequels can ruin a classic, thought give BB 3 episodes and see. * Watched the entire 62 episodes solid within 5 days.

Not better than ""The Wire"" that still remains the greatest series ever created but definitely worthy of top 3/5 status.

That good i could probably watch it again next week. No story is ever rushed to fit into an episode, where an episode ends might not always be where the next one begins because theres more angles to this gripping, funny yet tragic plot. You can love a character then flip and hate them. So very well written and apart from the last couple of episodes to have 5 series and only cover a 18 month span really kept it more real. Unfortunately Walt Jnr & Jessie do age more than 18 months lol but look past that and this will be a classic still in the year 2040 and onwards.

Brilliance at play"

10.0,26 May 2021,"Don't ever judge this series by its first two season. Yes,it might be a bit slow at the beginning but as the show progresses the intensity and quality of the show increases gradually."
10.0,4 July 2014,"It's the story of a man, an overachieved teacher who could not stand his miserable life anymore. He got so angry and so human that he get's to the dark side. Well it's not easy to turn back when you get there is it? This series shows the human nature, the realism of a simple teacher tryng to became the CEO of a criminal empire. For those who became a bit curious if it's possible, without creating a comic's or ultra fantasy scrip, this is the one to watch. Breaking Bad explore it's characters and make you become part of their world, make you so close to them that you feel in your skinny their difficulties and issues. Their goals and what their are giving up. But above all it's about a men and how power can change him, slow and brutally."
10.0,24 November 2023,"That's great , The best movie I have seen in my life was this movie, I recommend you not to miss it, especially those who love science and chemistry will go crazy for it, Heisenberg is the king of chemistry and I really liked his character, I like him more. I'm afraid to tell you, but I'm afraid that I've spoiled it, so I'll tell you this so that you can see the rest of the story yourself and enjoy it. Honestly, I have not forgotten that this movie is a masterpiece and you will go crazy after it , I can't imagine the world without the Breaking Bad series. In short, without spoiling your head, this series is a masterpiece."

10.0,18 June 2015,"It's hard to say something that hasn't been said about this TV show before. just to start with a cast, their acting was above every level of awesomeness, every single character, their lines, all of them were very interesting. plot was unbelievably cool, they way Walter Walter's character changed over every episode was just mind-blowing, it was done in such a way that you don't even notice until he does something unexpected. the final was one of the best endings I've ever seen, it was just pure definition of perfect. you literally can't find any flaws in this show. even most boring episode (fly) was very interesting because of it's dialog, and character development. pure awesomeness, can't say more."
10.0,22 May 2021,
10.0,14 May 2014,"Crime does pay or maybe not. The entire series revolves around drugs from cooking, substance abuse to consequences. To me anything to do with drug movies is just plain boring. Bunch of junkies sticking it up their veins and drug cartels running rings. However, the approach to this drama is new. The suspense packed episodes overdose you and make you an addict yourself to the show. Acting is excellent and the entire cast does justice to their scripts. Most of the characters are so well developed that even the bad guys leave a lasting impression. If you want to watch a good series nothing gets better. Most TV shows fizzle out after 1-3 seasons this one keeps getting you the chills. Get the series now and a must watch for all. Its not just about drugs there is more than it meets the eye."
10.0,21 July 2014,
10.0,16 January 2014,"-I used to prefer Dexter, but the last seasons just sucked and made the show to be not perfect like Breaking Bad is. Breaking Bad's seasons are all good ones and it gets better and better and better and better and better. The cast is perfect. Just pick the perfect actors for the roles. Bryan Cranston it's the shoulder of all the show. He brings the tension, comedy and drama that makes Breaking Bad what it is. Walter White A.K.A Heisenberg is my favorite character of the show and maybe history of television. But it's not just Bryan also the other shoulder, Aaron Paul. The chemistry between them it's perfect like all in this show. Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte, Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, just everybody in the show is perfect for the roles they play. Still thinking why Mad Men won over Breaking Bad 2 consecutive years for Drama Series. I mean Mad Men is good but far far far far far away from Breaking Bad. Now that have won 2 Golden Globes, I cannot wait for more awards. Specially the Emmys,yeah I think it will win all the Emmys in each Category. Bryan Cranston for Lead Actor, Aaron Paul for Supporting Actor, Anna Gunn for Supporting Actress, Drama Series and maybe Directing and Writing for its best episode 'Ozymandias' 5x14. Just love the Show and hope Bryan won his last Emmy in August. Perfect ending by the way, Bitch!"

10.0,11 July 2020,"Breaking Bad is definitely one of the best tv shows ever made. It doesn't get boring, and it keeps getting better and better every episode.

10.0,18 May 2021,I loved this tv series .. my favorite TV series ever after u watch this will be ur favorite TV series.
9.0,20 April 2015,"My First review here, so let's go to it.

After Watching Breaking Bad this year i was in shock because it was Such a great show that i had to keep digging and finding more info about the show and maybe alternate reads of it, after seeing the color theory i will have to re-watch the whole show and pay more attention god i want to erase my mind and watch it always i'm jealous of EVERYONE who can watch breaking bad at first such a beautiful series my favorite of all time by FAR.

After the End and all of my research on the internet i have finally landed here and absolutely Agree with the grades (execpt the series it should be a 9,8 MINIMUM but h8rs everywhere), and man i think no series will ever get a 10 again because giving a 10 to another show would be the same that being said it's even with breaking bad and at this point no show is even close so like the title says: It will be Hard to give another 10 after seeing this show."

10.0,12 July 2014,"I'm pretty excited to write the 600th review for Breaking Bad. This show had kept me awake at nights as I wanted to watch just one more episode. It truly is the best of TV shows I have watched.

In terms of acting, Bryan Cranston has beaten everyone in playing the good and the bad. It has been this change in the major characters that leaves you with a weird feeling in the end. You don't even know whether to feel bad, pity on W.W. and Jesse or plain sadness about all that happened. It is this feeling that makes this show one of the greatest.

I do agree that Season# 3 was a blunder and it kept sort of dragging things up for no reasons, but Season#4 and 5 makes up for anything and everything.

The only verdict that this show can have : The best show ever !!"
10.0,10 December 2016,
10.0,10 July 2015,"I can easily say that, Breaking Bad is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Set in Albuquerque, the series follows the life of a high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (brilliantly played by Bryan Cranston), who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of the first series.

Breaking Bad tracked Walt's transformation from a decent, excellent high school teacher to criminal mastermind and the transition of his character. The mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher Mr. White comes to that point where he thinks that life can't get any worse. Learning that he has terminal cancer, and realising that his illness probably will ruin his family financially, Walt becomes desperate to secure his family's future before he dies, turning to a life of crime, making/cooking and selling methamphetamine, as a result, he ruined his own family and the lives of several others in the process. However, in the tensioned final half hour, somehow he won back a measure of both sympathy and respect - not least by surrendering the pretence that he's done it all for his family. At last Walt told Skyler: ""I did it for me,"" ""I liked it. I was good at it."" ""I was ALIVE!""

One way or another, Heisenberg ticked off every item on his unfinished business list, while the scenes slipped by at their customary stately pace, wasting his enemies, settling a score with his old rivals, freed his protégé, apologised to his wife and ensuring that his children would - someday - get the drug money he believes they deserve.

The series delivered everything that has been great about Breaking Bad: tension, emotion, pathos, brutality, humour, jaw-dropping shocks – and last, but not least: resolution.

Jesse Pinkman's character, intensely played by Aaron Paul, giving a memorable performance in the show and building a natural chemistry with the lead character, Mr. White – and exceptional play of an Exceptional actor: Bryan Cranston.

Beautifully written by Vince Gilligan, carefully directed by a great team, with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, brilliant acting, absolutely great cast – couldn't get any better.

Breaking Bad might not be perfect, but is definitely a great piece of art."
10.0,13 January 2021,"I have watched this series three times and every time I watched like four episodes in a day. Every episode leave you with some curiosity so you are forced to watch the next episode. Besides the great acting, the directors and writers did a great job."

10.0,20 July 2014,"You can't think of a TV series this good,,to be fact bound this is probably the best work done on an electronic device which has a display(TV..:)), Bryan Cranston is so so addictive that if you have ever had METH you could survive its scarcity in times of need but when it comes to watching him act your urge will kill you. i think this much is enough to review a title this ""great""...in fact a new word to define the excellence of this TV series should be mentioned. ""Methylvalous"". To talk about the supporting cast Aaaron Paul has done a fantastic job,,in fact a fantastic act.he portrays a character of a spoilt school going brat who is secretively into making meth along side his schooling to earn money and goes on to partner his school chemistry teacher(Bryan Cranston) in making the world's purest blue meth. Anna Gunn,Dean Norris,Betsy Brandt and of course Wlater Jr. do play their part very well. All in all you cannot ask for a more Dark comical tragic Thriller TV serial."
10.0,8 February 2015,"What more can I say about this show other than that it is the best show I've ever seen. I watched this because I saw that Ozymandias got a 10/10 and I saw all the awards and I was like, heck yes I'm watching this show. I finished it in under 2 weeks and was so intrigued every second of every episode. The last episode was my favorite ending ever. It ended perfectly! I love this show because of the phenomenal acting, writing, directing, and plot overall. It is a genius idea. Thank you AMC for making amazing TV shows. I love Breaking Bad.

Nuff said.

Breaking Bad."
10.0,17 November 2020,This is the best TV show ever made. It's just perfect in every way.
10.0,25 June 2014,"I've watched this series twice now, and the acting and writing are so good, that I can defy you to watch this and not love it!!!!

The season ending episode, is so good, that even after having watched it maybe 10 times now, I still pick up little things that I did not catch the first times around.

The last few minutes are RIVETING... to say the least, and the very last scene in the met lab, when they started the music from Badfinger, was so spot on, that even the words to the song, described Walt to a T!!!

It is a long series ( 62 episodes ), but personally I wish it would have never ended, it is that good!"
9.0,25 November 2020,"That TV show is masterpiece, idk what to say, u can rewatch 10 times and still have fun till u watch this masterpiece."
9.0,25 January 2022,"Vince (the director) focused on the details and the development of the characters and building events, and all these standards gave the show a unique flavor that made it special."
10.0,26 June 2022,"I was pressured for a very long time to see this show. I kept hearing how amazing it is. Basically, the pinnacle of television. I put it off for a long time to make sure I have enough spare time to appreciate it, and also I've been a bit bored lately, so I finally decided to give it a shot. I went in it completely blind as I somehow have managed to avoid seeing any spoilers for it since it has come out.

So let's start with the positives:

The acting and dialogue are amazing! 10/10. The scenes feel very naturally flowing and I can feel myself being pulled into them as if I'm in the same room. The interactions between the character are organic, the issues they are facing feel familiar and down to earth, making it very easy to empathize with them. Bryan Cranston in particular is amazing at portraying all the feelings and struggles of Walter White.






Now onto the not-so-good parts:





It pains me to say this, it really does, but it seems ""Breaking Bad"" is a victim of the emperor has no clothes phenomenon. Don't get me wrong, it is a decent show with some really strong points, but it's being pulled down by a lot of issues people seemingly don't want to talk about. So much so that I got tired of waiting it to become good and eventually dropped it halfway through Season 2 and only remembered to write this review 2 weeks after the fact."
10.0,29 October 2020,I just finished this show and I really wish I could delete it from my brain and watch it again because it's one of the best shows that I've ever watched in my entire life if not THE BEST.
10.0,31 May 2014,"I sincerely believe that everyone here has lived through one of the greatest shows in the history of TV. I highly doubt another series will surpass Breaking Bad - the calibre of the show was just unbelievable. The acting; breathtaking. The plot; riveting...heartbreaking. The writers; genius. The soundtrack; compelling. The character development; unparallelled. Everything about this show was unforgettable, and there's a huge breaking bad shaped void in my life that I will never be able to fill.

Thank you to everyone involved in the making of Breaking Bad, because it was, quite simply, perfect."
10.0,28 December 2013,"Breaking Bad has always been my favorite TV series but I never felt like writing a review about it or something, since many many people already said before me just what I wanted to say: it's without a doubt, the best TV series ever. That's something only a person who has followed plenty of TV shows in his own life could say, and I am that kind of person. I've seen The Sopranos, Dexter, The Walking Dead, Game Of Thrones, Twin Peaks and many other arguably defined ""best TV shows ever"", and Breaking Bad is definitely the best among them. The only one that's only SLIGHTLY inferior is HBO's best, Six Feet Under. Sure, I still have to try out shows like Mad Men and The Wire, but I doubt they could even go close to this AMC masterpiece. Breaking Bad is a perfect mix, since it has comedy, tragedy, action, horror and cop stuff, and no movie or show has ever integrated so many different genres in such a perfect way. Everything about it is excellent: the soundtrack, the directing, the montage, the metaphors, the little details, the acting, the writing, the twists... I never could describe it with words without missing important features it has, because it's a complete show, maybe the only one ever. 10/10"
10.0,18 February 2021,"The first episode of Breaking Bad will make you wonder is it really the highest rated TV show but as the story progresses in its own turtle pace, you'll realise why it is so popular even though the final season aired years ago.

It brings you a master piece that takes several Youtube videos to realise how great the show really is. The casting, the foreshadowing and especially the character development is mind blowing. The show has the 2 best character developments ever seen on TV (in my opinion) in Walter White and Jessie Pinkman.

The show revolves around a theme US never gets bored of : drugs. As you see a simpleton High School teacher progress to become a Drug Empire's core you begin to like the protagonist as he taps into the darkness present in everyone (classic entertainment industry move) and then just like you'd expect, he gets too dark. Meanwhile you feel sympathetic for his sidekick, curse his wife and wonder was his son just physically handicapped.

The show unfolds it plots quite slowly. However at the end of every episode it leaves you a trail of serotonin forcing you to sit on your couch for yet another episode shot with yellow filters because apparently it's Mexico.

The actors have done their part really well as you end up not just judging their stupid and weird behaviour but also feel their pain. (Yes you feel a lot of their pain). The tragedies that takes place in every character's life is complimentary to the theme of the show. The dialogues carry their weights and the color gradient is immaculate. It doesn't come up with a musical score that you'd call absolutely gorgeous, but you'll stick around for an entire episode with no story progression or character development because it's worth it.

Breaking Bad is one of the best shows ever made. It is justified. It is beautiful. It is a masterpiece. It is SATISFYING, it is worth your time!

ps: El Camino: a Breaking Bad movie is the icing on the cake."

I put off watching this show for SO long as I didn't want to get caught in the hype. So many people were talking about it and after watching it, I see perfectly why. The wittiness, subtle comedic value, the attention to detail, the character build up, the story development, the cinematography, the camera angles. I could go on and on. The writers did a flawless job. Absolutely love this show and 10 put of 10 is entirely deserved!!!

10.0,27 September 2013,"Not only is this the greatest thing ever to be on TV screens, its a total game changer. Nobody else will get away with anything substandard anymore, after people have gotten a taste of the good stuff anything less will not satisfy them anymore, just like drug addicts. This show is 99% quality just like Heisenberg's meth. It is impossible to stay emotionally unattached after watching this show, and that's what makes this the greatest show of all time, how will Walt handle everything? The characters are very real and relatable and the acting is brilliant throughout. Breaking Bad is not as popular as the most popular TV shows, because it is just too good and too intelligent, it is ahead of its time but it has brought us to the future of quality TV, everything from this point on will be compared to the greatest TV show that has existed so far."

10.0,10 June 2021,"What can I say about B. Bad that hasn't already been said? I think I like Better Call Saul a little more, as it isn't afraid to take risks and be more absurd.

They're both better at what they set out to do, and Breaking Bad is one of the rare examples of art and technical execution meeting perfectly to create a perfect (or damn close) experience.

This, Call Saul, and The Wire have all got to be my favorites and I think anyone who has the time should watch all of them."

10.0,24 July 2021,I liked it but my cousin didn't so we decided to rate it 9/10.
10.0,2 January 2014,"Amazing.... It has a different plot after the end of the second season. But without spoiling it, this show begins with the tale of a man's needs making him desperate. It later focuses on ambition and a mans desire to rule and leave behind a statue for all to glorify. The paradox is, no matter how much the writers seemingly antagonize the main characters, the audience always cheers for the owners of drug cartels and murderers. Season two is conclusive and a cliff hanger at the same time. There are few television series like this. I have not enjoyed a show enough to tune in on since Seinfeld and Friends. You will love this so long you don't give up during the first few episodes before an actual plot develops."

10.0,1 February 2022,"It's surely an amazing storyline, acting, and an interesting show, but i personally think two seasons would have been enough for it.

I think it was waaaay too long, there were so many episodes not useful and it was very obvious that at some time the director was just trying to add random scenes to complete an episode ( example, the fly episode, and many many others)

Again, great show but too long."
10.0,16 March 2021,"This masterpiece of art will take you on an emotional rollercoaster like none other. The ups, downs, the twists, is really incredible. I've seen GOT, The Wire, The Sopranos. All great shows in their own right. But no other show has managed to keep getting consistently better season to season. Warning though: If you watch this, you will be as addicted to this as Walt is to power and Jesse to meth. Once finished, it will leaving you wanting more and more, but always chasing the purple dragon. This is greatest show of all-time, bar-none."

9.0,10 March 2021,"This is my favourite series of all time. It has all you like. I love the drugs theme and is so dark. Bryan Cranstorm delivered us a fantastic show and we need to thank him. If you haven't seen this show, I recommand you with all my heart!"
10.0,15 October 2021,"The finale and last season were a bit lackluster in my opinion. I just thought the show would reach higher economic heights showing them really ball out and make way more money than they did. A bit of a letdown.

Jesse is an awesome character and my favorite by far. Walt just becomes a horrible person as the show goes on.

The Flynn character acting is pretty bad. It gets worse throughout the show. Especially towards the end, just very inconsistent and hard to ignore.

Walt's wife is a VERY unlikeable character. That's a bit of an understatement.

There are a lot of cool characters that are well played. I do not regret watching it, it was good."

10.0,5 March 2021,Flawless show Starts well and gets better and better
9.0,26 March 2021,"In my entire life, I've never seen a TV show that good. I've seen many TV shows and can count how many of them came close to be as good as Breaking Bad. Everything about Breaking Bad, the acting, directing, writing it's all top notch. The tone of the show was kept consistent throughout it's five seasons.

If you watch the first season now, you'll probably be shocked by how much the story and characters evolved through it's runtime. Walter and Jesse, became such nuanced characters throughout the seasons. Bryan Cranston gave me one of the most believable performances I've ever seen, as well as Aaron Paul. I keep telling my friends, you guys gotta watch Breaking Bad it will change the way you see TV shows. And they don't believe me. I don't blame them, cause at first I never pictured that Breaking Bad could be as good as it is.

This show is different in every sense, it's very special. Two of my favorite episodes ever, Ozymandias and Felina are bars that I have set for TV episodes. I still look for episodes as good as these. The Laws of Gods and Men, from Game of Thrones, Hero, from Attack on Titan, Who Goes There and Form and Void, both from True Detective. These are a few examples of episodes that came close to the greatness of those two.

This show is special, and I honestly recommend this to ANYONE. If you despise TV shows, don't think they are as good as Cinema or Anime, whatever. Breaking Bad will most likely change your mind. Watch this, it's not only entertainment, it's art.

PS: I also recommend Better Call Saul if you fall in love with this universe."
9.0,21 February 2021,I can't imagine a better series than this. Big respect to Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul

10.0,29 September 2018,"Well, I started watching Breaking Bad for a the hype about it. Always rated as best tv show in youtube videos, and I read so many good reviews about it. When I started watching I wasn't impressed at all. Don't get me wrong, it is a good show, but certainly not the best in history; I mean like any of you who say Breaking Bad is the best have you watched Game of Thrones? Compring Game of Thrones to Breaking Bad is a crime in my opinion. Season one and two can be made a movie instead of twenty eposides full of boring scenes( breakfast scenes most of all). Season three and four it got a little better, more action and suspense going on. Season five is legendary, many events going, they finally started sacrificing characters. But the show never reached the hype about it. I wish I can understand why this show is rated 9.5."
10.0,15 March 2021,"This is a show with complete package from start to end . There is no such point of show which will disappoint you. Most show where you find ending not up to the expectations but this one is completely different. Storyline, acting, screenplay, direction and the hunger will be always there to watch what next. All the characters whether small or big but it creates a lasting impression. It is a 10/10 show for me even though the show has been more than 10 years now."
10.0,19 March 2021,As the title suggests this is the greatest show of all time . As many have suggested GOT was the only TV series that was going to ever come close to topping this and it failed miserably at the end . I watched BB back in 2013 and it honestly blew me a way . I have now in 2021 convinced my wife to watch it and I am enjoying it as much as I did the first time watching it with her . It really is just a masterpiece and think it will be a timeless classic for Many many years to come . Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are absolutely sensational their chemistry on screen is brilliant (no pun intended). Comical at Times without even meaning to be . The rest Of the cast are also solid . It's going to take something special to knock BB off my top spot of GOAT show of all time .

And btw, the i have never seen such successful character builup before..you cn actually have a series on most of the key characters... For me, its the ""Titanic"" in series..."
10.0,7 March 2021,The last three episodes are perfection. The way they close the series out is so satisfying. This and the Friday Night Lights series finale are what we all deserved as loyal fans.

10.0,18 February 2021,"I've seen a lot of tv series. But when it comes to Breaking Bad, I always ignored it. I didn't got no time for it. But one day back in January 2020 i started watching it. I loved first season. What a storyline, cinematography. I was like why i haven't watched it yet. However i was so obsessed with this series that i literally cannot stop thinking about it. After finishing it i was like what have i just watched😦😦😲 I've never been so obsessed with anything like Breaking Bad. I have watched it 3 times till now. To me Breaking Bad is the greatest series of all time. Gonna start watching tomorrow again probably. Love you Walter white, love you Jesse Pink."
10.0,26 December 2013,"The entire series becomes addictive after watching a couple of episodes of first season. It reaches its peak in the last two seasons.

The journey of Walter white is like a roller coaster ride and the intelligence of the character mesmerizes you.

I had a marathon course while watching it and by the time i finished I felt the same way it feels like finishing a good book.

The best part is you are introduced to interesting characters all way and most of them make an impact as much as the lead characters.

The creators have made a good story and the scenes and direction of each episode is flawless.. I happened to watch the story making time-lapse video of an episode of breaking bad and truly appreciate the effort put into it.

I can undoubtedly say that this is the best TV show I ever watched and a highly addictive one. This is simply not a series to be missed."
10.0,8 June 2015,"This show is the most BadAss TV show i ever watched. Awesome script, killer dialogs, best acting...this show has everything it takes to make the best show ever. When i first started watching it, i thought its too slow or seemed like it lacked the spark. The reason was i could not connect to its story but when i did its all i could think and talk about. All the time i used to watch which even made my friend and family addicted to it. And you wont stop saying ""Yeah B***H"". So believe me its worth the time. Bryan Cranston and AARon Paul made justice to their characters, superb acting...also the other actors did a great job in playing their character. There was never a time where i felt that these characters wouldn't exist in real life. Even though Skyler made me furious sometimes."

10.0,27 April 2020,"Breaking Bad

This was my choice for a quarantine box set as I missed it at the time.

Much was brilliant, a gathering storm up to the end of series 4, it then perhaps seems the case it was a victim of its own success. Series 5 became baggy and unfocused and really was quite unrecognisable from what had gone before.

Walter had clear motivations behind his actions, following the death of Fring everything just fell into an abyss of contrivances.

The cast universally were quite brilliantly played. I would say that Aaron Paul was the right man at the right place in the right part and perhaps of the entire cast the weakest actor, but still gave a mesmeric performance.

If I was to put my finger on the key brilliance of this show I would say it lays in the meticulous planning and nuance of the script, and really striking new ground in the breadth and scope of TV drama.

Overall I loved it"

10.0,4 April 2021,"Breaking Bad. I still can't believe some of my friends despite my insistence have not yet watched Breaking Bad. Ignorance is not Bliss!!!

Category; Timeless Masterpiece; Adventure beckons, become drawn into the life of Walter White. His evolution into the Heisenberg persona from schoolteacher to Meth cook.

How his character evolves in the choices he makes, and how countless others become swept into his chaotic wake. The double life, the betrayal of his own family and the battle for his and his family's survival in the complicated world of drug running, pits each of these into a spiraling vortex that keeps you on edge from beginning to end. It's 10 out of 10 on every count. The script is imaginative and compelling, it's believable and astounding. The acting is unsurpassed and therefore able to form a connection with the viewer. The Cinematography delivers on the same high plateau as the aforementioned, completing the experience...don't miss this!!! I synced with this series for good after the third episode series 1 , from that moment I was on the roller coaster!!!"

10.0,28 February 2021,"Just finished binge watching the 5-series over 5-days of the acclaimed TV series. I was less interested in it when it was on originally, due to the fact that it was another drug related serial and others that followed in its wake, i.e. Ozarks. But, having to quarantine for last two weeks allowed opportunity to see it all together. Yes it is masterfully made, with exceptional acting & sensational story plots, right down to its climax. So, I have nothing against the programme itself, but I reflect upon the idea that it's based upon, of drug cartels, manufacturing, distributing, with help & protection from highest echelons of power, all geared towards targeting the most vulnerable in the society. All of it for ego, entitlement & greed that is never satisfied, regardless of how many lives are destroyed in sacrifice to make few people rich, that are morally corrupt without any care for humanity. The serial is exceptional in its depiction of the journey of one man, but what could have been highlighted in more detail is the impact it has upon the underbelly of the world that starves & scrapes for drugs instead of buying food or to be healthy. Sensationalism of drugs is the last thing that we need in a country like USA where the Federally legalised drug manufacturers already rip-off the patients with overpriced medication; not to mention the opioid epidemic that they have created for their greed to be drug kingpins of the world. Alarmingly the corporations are in bed with the congress, the senate, the politicians that are elected to serve & protect their constituents, and they all have made a never ending web of exchanging money for power & power for money at the cost of millions in USA & around the world that suffer due to such deplorable deeds of people in public offices. If anything there should be more light shed on such scenarios instead of making programmes about glorifying drugs in any manner. All said & done, it's an exception programme & glad to have experienced it with gratitude."
9.0,25 February 2021,Words are insufficient to describe Breaking Bad Better to watch it.
10.0,15 January 2015,"It's simple. I've never been so hooked up with a series in a my life. Since I watched the first episode in season 1, I couldn't stop watching it. Vince Gilligan did a fantastic work here. The written is a piece of art. The opening theme is sticky. The characters, the script, the actors, the locations, the shots... it's ALL WELL DONE! Every minute, every second is enjoyable. Want to know my truth? today I finished watching all seasons, and I can't imagine my life going on without more seasons of Breaking Bad. I'm sad, because I will miss Mr. White and Mr. Pinkman.

This is the best series in history."
10.0,18 April 2012,"Breaking Bad had a slow start. The first season took some time to get used to. The second season became interesting, and the third and fourth make it one of the finest dramas of all time. What's so interesting about Breaking Bad is that you simply cannot take any character's side and stay partial to him/her. The story picks up pace brilliantly as seasons progress. One of the major assets of this show is its razor sharp and quite splendid characterization.

Quite simply, Breaking Bad is one of the finest, American television has had to offer after the likes of Six Feet Under, The Sopranos and AMC's very own Mad Men."
10.0,23 February 2021,"I have watched some good shows, but I always have that voice in the back of my head whispering eerily ""breeeeaaaaking baaaaaaad was betterrrrrrr."" Nothing compares. It is the single most gut wrenching, most tear jerking, most awe inspiring, most terrifying, most expectation defying, most emulsifying...(okay now I'm just rhyming lol), but seriously- THE GREATEST SHOW EVER MADE- period. The end.

Ps: the only show in my mind that even comes close is actually Better Call Saul, and even it seems rudimentary compared to BB."
10.0,23 November 2020,We are not worthy for a show this good. 7 years after the show has finished and nothing has come close to its greatness. At least we have better call saul and el camino (which have to be some of the best spinoffs ever) but even BCS is ending next year. Vince gilligan don't let the world of breaking bad die. We need more.

10.0,15 February 2015,"If you are a bit like me you might think that a TV series on drugs can't be very interesting. However I've been proved wrong. This show is the most intense, profound and brilliant show I have ever seen.

Describing this show is not easy though. What makes it this special? To me it is the psychological depth of the characters, the progression of life stories and the small and large scale snowball effects in response to choices being made.

I'm not a professional in filming techniques, but even I can see that Breaking Bad is also unique in camera work. Unusual angles are used to shoot a different than usual series and little imperfections are cherished instead of polished away. This series shows wrinkles, body hair and moles. Just as it shows people making little normal daily mistakes, that don't add to the story but make it look so much more natural.

To conclude I'd say if this TV series was a book it would be literature, so it is definitely a must watch!"

The performances, the cinematography, the use of colors, the setting, the premise, the action, the dialogues, the emotions, the story, the ending - everything is outright brilliant and perfectly done.

Have watched it many times since it ended and bad part about that is that no other show gave the same feels that this one did.

To all the people watching it for the first time, I'm jealous of you. Savor it."

The character development of the story is top tier. Vince Gilligan has done a great job presenting this season to us. The most beautiful way possible to show their audience. B*TCH!!!!

Perfect pace not too slow not too fast. The idea behind the story is brilliant. I don't want to spoil you people by start telling the story but I can't control myself. I would recommend you go watch this by yourself. This show is the only show rated on my list as a 10 star. And will be the only to have this honour until a new update comes."

10.0,4 January 2022,I have had countless recommendations to watch breaking bad and I am very pleased I have. The show has many high points and a few low points where the show is a little slow. But the high points are really high and enjoyable. There are some high octane moments but most of the time the quality of the show is a solid 8/10. The ending of season 4 and 5 was some of the best Tv I have ever watched. I am not happy with Skyler's character. But my favourite character is Jesse and Aaron Paul is amazing in this and so is Bryan Cranston as Walt. I am now excited to watch the prequel show and the el camino movie. I give breaking bad an 8.6/10.

10.0,4 September 2023,"This is an unusual series. I, like many other people, started watching it on the recommendation of friends. The response was mixed. I watched a couple of seasons and... stopped! Yes, I didn't want to watch it. I really got bored. But a year or so later, my friend and I started talking about Breaking Bad again. I confessed to him that I had not finished watching the series. He was surprised and strongly recommended that I continue watching. One evening I did just that. I watched several episodes ""through force"", but then ... then I was sucked in so that I could not tear myself away. I wanted to sleep, but I kept watching more and more episodes.

If this review is read by a person who, like me, stopped watching Breaking Bad, then be sure to continue. Then you will be pulled in so that you can not tear yourself away. I would put 10 points, but since I still interrupted my viewing, then let it be 9."

10.0,9 May 2021,"It is the most amazing show I've ever watched in my whole freakin' life. The duo of Walt and Jesse is just incredible. Everything is balanced and the show makes you fall for it deeply after every episode. You get hooked to the show and can't stop watching it. I see the relationship between Walt and Jesse as a Father- son relationship and that is the most heart touching element of the show according to me. I just want the director to continue this show because it is so damn awesome. If you haven't watched it, you are missing a major thing."

10.0,3 April 2024,"This show is arguably the best of all time. At every turn the plot is unpredictable yet very logical. The characters are perfect in their roles as well as the people the production team cast to fill their role. The acting in this show is second to none. The art in this show is also top notch almost every composition can be a still image and hung on a wall. Perfectly composed images and framing. As well as every detail is perfectly placed and their for a reason. A damn perfect show filled with drama, suspense, art, action, comedy and more. It touches every genre and the comedic genius is off the rails. Everyone would enjoy this show and everyone should have the chance to watch this. Incredible!!"
10.0,1 September 2020,"I,ve seen many different kind of series. My most regret is watching breaking bad. You, ll be drawned in it for a long time.

To make a long story short do not doubt and enjoy watching this masterpiece😉"
10.0,16 May 2020,"The second time I saw it, I found that there were so many details, and many links echoed with the later plot, with some irony. One white and one powder, it seems that I still like it. From any point of view, the play is worthy of God play. Cancer locks the final countdown of his life, but he lives out of it. To some extent, it's cancer that makes him reborn. After ""I am away"", it's an empire that neither the audience nor himself imagined."

10.0,3 December 2014,"This is my 1st review & I'll keep it short. I don't remember ever watching a series as good as this & the fact that the quality was kept up throughout the whole run was (to me), amazing. I love/d this show & doubt it will be bettered. I'm looking forward to the ""Better call Saul"" spin-off but i don't expect it to compare. It was a rare show, in the fact that the producers stopped when they did & didn't try to take it past it's best in an attempt to make more cash. The Spin-off looks as though it may be trying to do just that though, only time will tell. Finally, on the off-chance that there is anyone out there that needs any more of a hint that this show wouldn't be a waste of their time &/or cash (re; DVD). I would recommend this to anyone except for young kids, due to the drug theme throughout."

The sympolism the reality the morality every moment of Breaking bad takes you to a whole other word and to the real word at the same time .. really thanks a lot for such show and thanks for whoever recommended to me!!
10.0,18 November 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a gripping, intense, and flawlessly executed drama series that undeniably revolutionized television storytelling. Created by Vince Gilligan, it aired from 2008 to 2013, spanning five seasons that showcased an unparalleled journey into the depths of human morality, choices, and consequences.

The series centers around Walter White (played phenomenally by Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Faced with the reality of leaving his family in financial ruin, Walter turns to manufacturing and selling methamphetamine to secure their future. He partners with former student and small-time meth manufacturer Jesse Pinkman (portrayed brilliantly by Aaron Paul), setting off a chain of events that unravels the complexities of their characters and the morally grey world they inhabit.

One of the show's standout strengths lies in its character development. Walter White's transformation from a mild-mannered teacher to a calculated drug kingpin is enthralling yet haunting. Cranston's portrayal is nuanced, portraying Walter's descent into darkness with a depth that's both chilling and empathetic. Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman is equally compelling, evolving from a troubled addict to a character burdened by guilt and seeking redemption.

The writing of ""Breaking Bad"" is nothing short of exceptional. Each episode is meticulously crafted, delving deep into moral dilemmas, ethical boundaries, and the repercussions of one's choices. The tension is palpable throughout, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats as the characters navigate a world fraught with danger and moral ambiguity.

Visually, the show is a work of art. The cinematography, use of color symbolism, and meticulous attention to detail elevate the storytelling. From the vast New Mexico landscapes to the cramped, tense interiors, every scene is crafted to evoke emotion and immerse the audience in the characters' world.

What sets ""Breaking Bad"" apart is its ability to explore complex themes without compromising on entertainment value. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of the drug trade, human nature, and the price of ambition. It challenges viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the choices people make when faced with dire circumstances.

The supporting cast is exceptional, adding depth and richness to the narrative. Characters like Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), and Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) contribute to the show's brilliance, each with their distinct motivations and impact on the story.

The final season serves as a masterclass in storytelling, with a culmination that is both satisfying and thought-provoking. The series finale delivers closure while leaving enough room for interpretation, ensuring that ""Breaking Bad"" remains a topic of discussion and analysis long after its conclusion."
10.0,1 August 2021,Most nice series I watch ever in my life.o love it.

10.0,30 November 2018,One of the best shows I've watched but it's not for the faint of heart. It has some really slow spots and odd pacing at times. The characters are solid by and far. Some scenes are hard to watch due to the content. There are a number of shots that are remarkable in terms of the cinematography. Overall the show is very well done.

9.0,8 September 2020,BEST SERIES EVER MADE if you wanna see a series without getting exhusted for even one minut you should see it.
10.0,20 September 2018,"Having been introduced to Breaking Bad on Sunday, I now find myself watching back to back episodes of the programme as soon as I've finished work, I watch solidly until 12 midnight and up again at 5am for work. No other tv goes on. Thankfully all my soaps are being recorded.

Great programme...A must watch!"
10.0,11 July 2017,"Intelligent, original and interesting story. Great acting. Logic in its own universe. Metaphorical and matter-of-fact at the same time. Simple and complex at the same time. I watched it twice and kept finding new reasons to love it. What other TV or movie can make buying a plastic container in Home Depot or installing a water heater actually interesting? It is the simplicity of the normal life that makes it so believable. Unlike other shows where one someone is ""smart"" you just have to believe they are. Here they SHOW you why they are smart. Actions have consequences. Godfather-like, except for 65 hours which, like a long classic book, I loved so much!"
10.0,16 May 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is undeniably one of the most outstanding television series of all time and a personal favorite of many viewers, including myself. With its meticulously crafted storyline, brilliant performances, and unparalleled character development, the series stands as an absolute masterpiece.

The plot of ""Breaking Bad"" is captivating and gripping from start to finish. The journey of chemistry teacher Walter White's transformation into a methamphetamine cook and drug lord immediately hooks the audience. The suspense and unpredictable twists keep viewers on the edge of their seats, eagerly awaiting each episode.

The acting performances are phenomenal. Bryan Cranston shines in his role as Walter White, delivering a performance for the ages. His portrayal of the character's evolution from an unassuming family man to a ruthless criminal is both impressive and nuanced. Aaron Paul also excels as Jesse Pinkman, adding an extra layer of emotional depth to the series.

The character development in ""Breaking Bad"" is exceptional. Each character is carefully and thoughtfully crafted, allowing viewers to understand their motivations and conflicts. The moral ambiguity of the characters and the exploration of the concepts of good and evil make the series even more compelling, leaving room for intense discussions and reflection.

The visual design and directing are also remarkable. The series' dark and gritty aesthetics mirror the depths of its characters and story. The cinematography and shot composition are cohesive and enhance the emotional impact of the scenes.

""Breaking Bad"" is a series that leaves a lasting impression. It tackles themes of power, morality, and human nature in a thought-provoking manner. With its gripping storyline, outstanding performances, and excellent character development, the series unquestionably deserves a rating of 10/10. ""Breaking Bad"" is a timeless masterpiece that continues to be regarded as a pinnacle of television even years after its initial airing."

10.0,6 July 2017,"Not much can be said about what hasn't been said. This is one of, if not the, greatest drama of all-time. It has revolutionized viewer expectations, and has created a nightmare for TV drama writers. People now expect BrBa quality, but that is extremely hard to reach. But acting, directing, writing, story, characterization, are all phenomenal. My only flaw, is that like meth it has formed an addiction with no way to truly suppress my addiction now that its over. But I am thankful they ended this show on a high note, and didn't continue it past its lifetime, like so many great shows do **cough** Walking Dead **cough**."

Tweaker, hood rats, bottom feeders that will rip you off in everyday possible to get their fix. This series proved that no matter what you do, how you do it you WILL NOT live a life of fast cars and beautiful women. You will drive trashed cars and the women, the toothless, skinny spunned out tweaker are no prize. This series shows this. I wished it didn't have to end."

10.0,10 October 2018,"The writers, directors, who ever came up with the plot, the character designs, the epic scenes, every angle i try to look at this show from, it's always damn near perfect! This is one of those shows that makes the audience feel smarter as their watching, in Breaking Bad the writing and acting are so technical, everything feels answered at the end. It's a very serious show but its aesthetic thru-out is just so engaging with the audience. The writers and directors did such a good job of just letting all the important characters progress, and from a birds eye view, looking at this show from start to finish, makes it a show like none other."
10.0,10 October 2019,"Constantly engaging, brutally breathtaking scenarios at points, pitch-perfect emotions and great level acting this is what makes all seasons of Breaking Bad very catchy.

10.0,24 October 2018,"I first watched this series 3 years ago and was totally blown away by it. It truly deserves every accolade that has been bestowed upon it. How it sucks you in to every scene and makes you love or hate a character whether you want to or not, makes this the greatest thing ever to grace a tv or cinema screen. When I got to the end of the whole series, I wished it could go on and on for ever but I knew it had to come to a conclusion sometime - otherwise what's the point of a film of tv show I suppose. But fear not - because if you haven't seen it in a while, watch the whole thing again. You will be pleasantly suprised how much you may have missed or misunderstood the first time around and it actually felt like I was watching it for the first time!"
10.0,16 September 2020,"Breaking Bad created by Vince Gilligan was one of the best creation in the Tv series. Bryan Cranston as Walter White aka.

10.0,4 March 2020,"Breaking Bad is a protracted Macbeth. It tells the same story, it just takes much longer to get to the point: relatively average man by all accounts has the opportunity to benefit from an evil deed, so he does the evil deed. But then he learns that sin corrupts and blinds the intellect, and evil deed after evil deed, evil becomes more and more easy to commit, and eventually is just about the only thing the person is capable of.

The show-- although this goes unreported-- issues many challenges to materialist philosophies and the like. Although modern, it is also very anti-modern in important ways.

Took away one star because there's some smut the show didn't need. Otherwise, the gold standard."
10.0,3 September 2020,"Breaking Bad is truly one of the most captivating tv series in existence. Great acting, writing and character development.

Overall, Breaking Bad (Season 1) is a very solid start to a show that I've got high expectations for. This season essentially sets the scene for the following seasons. Bryan Cranston is superb as lead character, Walter White. He adds that sympathetic element to his character and he brings the show to life with every episode. There are many solid moments with each episode, that are thrilling and heartfelt. It's a very graphic show, but I feel that does serve the narrative for what is happening, but yes some small parts may be slightly unnecessary. But yes i do feel the show will only get better, and I can't wait to see where it goes. Jesse and Walter, love it!

Quote - I was curious. Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that. There's a lot of money in it, huh?

Rating - 4/5

Season 2:

Well this season kicked off big time and I'm starting to feel this is when Breaking Bad comes alive. This season never put a foot wrong in any department, the story of this season was fantastic and I loved how the writers added that thrill aspect all the way through. Once again, performances are excellent from everyone, just sublime acting. More characters are introduced that will no doubt become prominent figures, the writing is great and as I said in my review for the first season, the show is only gonna get better. I like where it's going and can't wait to see what happens next. My personal favourite episode was 9, 11 and the finale was outstanding.

Quote - 'Never trust a drug dealer' - Gus

Rating - 5/5.

Season 4:

This show just keeps getting better and better with each season. I can't praise it more than I already have. It's such a unique show that keeps outperforming itself with every episode, the direction, the acting, the cinematography are just a few of the reasons why Breaking Bad is one of the all time greats. I can't wait for the final season which I know will blow my mind. What a show

Quote - 'I Won' - Walt

Rating - 5/5.

Season 5:

This season just solidifies Breaking Bad's status as easily one of the greatest TV shows ever made, with a strong argument to say it is the greatest. This season builds on all the previous ones that came before it and goes the extra distance. The consistency that Vince Gilligan, the cast and crew manage to show throughout this whole journey is, for me, the main reason why it's the best show, just pure genius. But specifically this season had it all. Tears, drama, more tension and a finale that perfectly wraps up this quite unbelievable show.

Breaking Bad will live with me for a very long time, a show like no other that acts as the benchmark for others to reach, but it just isn't that easy. What a show, simply the best

Everything in this series is very good. The acting is great. Every character was written with care. I think that Walter White was the most well written character among them.

There are some scenes that are just unforgettable. With every season breaking bad gets better. And the 5th season is the best.

You should watch this series, once at least. It will give you some great moments to remember. It will give you some great characters to love. And I'm goddamn right.

Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is nothing short of brilliant, as he transforms from a timid high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman is equally impressive, bringing a vulnerability and rawness to his character that is captivating. The show's attention to detail and cinematography is unparalleled, capturing the grittiness and beauty of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and exceptional performances."

It is a Masterpiece,no doubt...how your mood changes towards the Antagonist,rooting for him 1 second,hating him the next,due to his decisions,the brilliantly layered 'Baddies',nearly all who sometimes to good things,(..especially Mike..).

10.0,14 January 2023,"If you like cinema, then this is the show to watch! Not only is it a compelling story,excellent character development, superb shot composition, but the color grading is what really set this over the top. Simply put, you will never have a more fantastic experience. First, the story, man is it classic southern gothic American dream if you never heard of one ""science teacher gets sick and must sell one of the worlds most dangerous drug to help his family survive"", absolute genius is what that is. The character development goes from a feeble and skittish to strong and feared, with all the little neat quirks in between!! Shot composition is so dynamic and structured, a true masterpiece. Finally, color grading,le pièce de résistance, from the first episode, first scene, Walter White in his underwear against a vibrant pastel blue sky and washed rust colored new Mexico clay. I was hooked. Then once you're all tuckered in, you get the meth. Brilliant blue against the alien yellow hazmat suits, it's enough to drive your cerebral brains out your eye sockets. I couldn't find a single flaw over the five times I watched the series."
10.0,27 April 2022,"I've been hearing how great the Breaking Bad is for years. Finally sat down and decided to give it a look. Glad I did, it had me hooked 10 minutes into the first episode. I am half way through season six and still not burned out, that is saying a lot for me. Only complaint is that I do find Skyler to be pretty annoying.

This show changed my life! I was someone else , I thought differently when I saw season 3 and 5 , I should appreciate life and what's given to me , I will never do drugs , I will study and become something! this is what the show gave me! gave me hope to change and maybe quit some of my own addictions like smoking ! please: if you want to change your life and maybe quit some bad habits , watch this TV series , it's something else ."

10.0,2 February 2018,"Though I may be very late (more than 4 years); but as soon as i got into the show, I watched the entire 62 episodes within a fortnight. Such an impressive job was done by the stellar cast, especially Bryan Cranston aka Walter White (also known as Heisenberg), that now I treat his character as a real life person out of fiction. The way he comes to know about his inoperable lung cancer and considering how much troubled his life was at beginning of season 1, it was pretty much clear that he had to do something off the charts to earn huge amount of money before he dies(to provide for his family). Here enters the other half of famed duo, Jesse Pinkman. He's a former student of Mr. White who is completely into drugs.Both of them are imperfect but are in sync when doing their common job i.e. coooking meth. Walter, being highly qualified chemistry high school teacher, makes purest meth which even surprises DEA. Everyone is after his famed 'Blue Sky' meth and the sales department is under Jesse. As we later progress into the series Walt and Jesse face many obstacles and enemies like Tuco Salamanca, Gus Fring , a Neo-Nazi group and even Walt's own DEA agent brother-in-law Hank Schrader. But Mr. White outsmarts everyone, either by trickery or total chaotic violence. At the end Walter dies , but on his own terms."

10.0,26 October 2023,"This is by far my favorite show so far. I've always kind of shyed away from shows like this but it was totally different than what I was expecting it to be. The two main characters Walter and Jesse are so incredibly written. Their opposite personalities make it so captivating to see them interacting with eachother.

It feels like there is never a time when they act out of character and I know it's because the writing is excellent, but the actors are perfect as aswell. They play their parts so incredibly well, it feels real. Aaron Pauls performance was absolutely amazing. And his acting in the last season was phenomenal. When he portrayed Jesse's despair it was truely gut wrenching.

And Walter is an amazingly written character. It's clear from episode one that he want's more from life, and we see him discover himself, for better or worse. Bryan Cranston did an amazing job at playing Walters character. You truely feel just how cruel Walter really is, you can feel his manipulation, almost as if his intentions were to manipulate the audience.

Anna Gunns performance was also incredible. I truely sympathized with her character during every season. She is a heartbreaking character, and Anna plays the role of Skylar perfectly. Her character in my opinion is also beautifully written. There is a lot of controversy on the likeabilty on her character, but for me she is my second favorite.

There are also other many amazing characters in the show but I'll spare the details as I don't want to give away spoilers. All I can say is that this show is definitely worth the watch. I'd give anything to watch this masterpiece for the first time again."
10.0,13 April 2019,"S1E3... Krazy-8 called it right there and then. ""Your real problem is sitting upstairs."" Jesse... Jesse mofo Pinkman. Now... BrBa isn't something new, and there have probably been doctorates written about it already. So I'll just summarize my emotions about the conclusion. I won't mark it as a spoiler, because it isn't. Besides... no matter how I describe Jesse - the truth is always worse.

To start off, BrBa reminded me of the final episode of Riget, another all-time cult classic, something that had a more abrupt ending and a far worse legacy, thanks to Steven bloody King. In that episode, the main actress was chasing someone and had to take an elevator down. And the elevator went to floor 0... -5... -10...-25...-50....-80.... It was an elevator to hell. That's what BrBa is. It's in the name, after all. No matter how tough do you think the situation where the protagonists find themselves in is - the worst is yet to come. It's not even seasons... it's almost like every episode is a floor down... to the last episode's abyss.

The cast is stellar. I mean, sure, there are some prime Hollywood stars that you can just put into anything and that'd be it, like Freeman, Willis, Depp etc, and I wouldn't say that I'd chase the cast of this show wherever else they'd star in. Well, maybe Cranston, he deserves that much. But the cast did their roles, and did them incredibly. Now, almost every character is unlikeable. In fact... only the secondary character are likeable. Steve Gomez, Gus, Lydia... Pretty much the entire main cast are basically mutations of humanity. There's Walter's wife, who really does an excellent job of being the least loving wife imaginable, let alone caring mother. There's their son, who tries his best to be sweet, but who is, after all, a literal r-tard. It's in the script. The DEA brother-in-law, Hank, a piece of work that really goes beyond even his pathetic agency, his wife, basically a mental criminal, who needs separation from society and placement into an asylum, but who is, after all, ""family"" and who is married to a DEA agent... I'm glad they don't have kids. This pair... deserves to be sterile. But no matter how terrible they are, Jesse, one of the protagonists, takes the cake.

Now, there were two actresses, whom I hated. Well, I mean, hated their characters. Because they were just too good. Marcia Harden from Mist... made the movie, which is quite basic by itself, pretty much unwatchable. Really incredible acting. And Kate Mara. The faces she made in FF2015 and Transcendence... You can't look at them without wanting to him her. Especially because she is female. But Aaron Paul... man. This guy... I'm not sure I'll be able to watch anything else he'd star in. Even that upcoming BrBa movie, if he'll be the lead. I... I really hate his character. He just gets the cake. The absolute monstrosity. The real villain. Hiding in plain sight. It wasn't Gus. It wasn't Walter or Hank. It was Jesse. And no, this isn't a spoiler, this is merely an opinion.

He went from being useless to more useless, from a mess to an even bigger mess. Somewhere in the middle of the show, when he sort of ""steeled"" himself - I thought they are going to develop him into something. Nope. Still a pathetic, useless shamble. A waste of life, literally. No lessons learned, ever. No effort, no effect. I mean, sure, there were a couple of moments with Gus, where he has sort of done something. I guess the writing can account to that much. But beyond that - he was the absolute antithesis of Walter. No matter what they do to Walter - he is an old man. He goes through hell so much that Dante would tip his hat. Yet he, from the beginning to the end... cares. He has an agenda, and this agenda is love.

Hank... he's an animal. A pig, a proper choice of an actor. Just literally a pig sniffling out his treat. Meticulous, narrow-minded, selfish. For a moment I hoped they'd develop him into anything resembling a human. But no... And yet, even foregoing Hank - Jesse is the real antithesis. A person, who cares for nobody. Well, he does get tantrums about children... not that he ever wants to make one, not unlike Hank. But beyond these tantrums - he is an empty shell. There is no loyalty, no care, no reason, no love, no logic, no comprehension. From the very first episode to the very last - his on-screen purpose is to be a parasite to Walter. A literal parasite.

Of course, the writing is sloppy. You can see the cracks from the very first season. Gilligan did a lot of work, and it is commendable, and I wouldn't do it any better, and that's something you can't say about most Oscar-winning movies nowadays. But still.... he had to tie just SO many loose ends, so many stories. Every character, every detail, every action - needed a consequence, if not a backstory. And so you begin to see the forced writing. I mean, obviously in the real world Hank's first guess would be Walter, come on. Doesn't take a genius. And even then - all of the ""solutions"" to their problems were forced. Krazy8's plate, Tuco's family\house, Gus' relationship with the Cartel... It's not documentary, but you see how many things are just ""too much"" of a coincidence.

And it's the worst in the last season. From Walter basically ""Dark Knight Rising"" himself across the country... to ""book"" that just happened to be... there... to that... pack of cigarettes... I mean, wow. Poor Gilligan really had to tie up everything and within a schedule. And I'll admit, again, he did it fine. Few shows and movies can brag about a proper ending, and I'd say I'm satisfied. It just felt a bit rushed. While, obviously, the story goes down stage by stage, and it couldn't overlap... ""something"" could've been done to make it more coherent. Less things left to chance, more things actually discussed or dealt with.

But then again, you realize two moments: ""everyone lies"". And Walter often makes a complete fool of himself, and I don't mean his ""certain moments"", forcing an unpleasant outcome. So when everyone lies - you can't seek reason or logic. When Jesse doesn't think, learn or improve, EVER... There is no other way. It could've been written better, but could it really have ended better, without dislodging the narrative? No. It is... Breaking Bad. And you can't break something bad without... breaking it.

Still, if there was something I'd give 10 stars without looking back - that's BrBa. Perhaps the last thing I should add - is how well the director operated, the style of the show. It's all.. REAL. I mean, I remember only once scene where CGI or special effects were used... you know, the Face-off. But other than that? It's all actually real. Filmed not on some 8k IMAX Red Digital Cinema. And such directing, coupled with proper writing and, again, stellar acting - makes this show actually palpable. That's something you really, really miss with modern movies, even Oscar ones. Everything is shot with green screen, stunt doubles, quality is replaced with CGI, writing - with pandering to the lowest common denominator. The fear of a 50 IQ kid\adult not understanding something, and thus requesting a ticket refund - is way bigger than the fear of making a joke of a picture. A joke can sell for a billion, Marvel can attest to that. But a work of art? Eh, it could rot in hell with all those 50 IQ kids not understanding it.

This show is not afraid to be brutal, depressing, nihilistic, outright burdening. I'm not sure fans of most shows\movies would like it, regardless of age. That is - I wouldn't mind showing it to a 10-year-old kid, assuming that this kid is raised properly. Because it would be a great lesson. But I'm not sure about showing it to my aging mother. She likes Vikings and stuff like that, semi-historic with dress-up and special effects. But for something to go dark, like pitch dark... Hell, even my friend of the same age doesn't quite feel like continuing to watch. And I can't blame him... but I can blame Jesse. That sonnova..."
10.0,13 March 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is a critically acclaimed American television series created by Vince Gilligan. It aired from 2008 to 2013 and follows the story of Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher turned methamphetamine manufacturer, and his former student and business partner, Jesse Pinkman.

9.0,3 June 2020,"Looking at the second pass, I found that there are so many details, and many links are also somewhat ironic because they echo the later plot. White and pink, I still seem to like it now. No matter from which point of view, the ""Poison Master"" is worthy of the divine drama. Cancer has locked the final countdown to his life, but he has lived out of it. To some extent, it was cancer that brought him back to life. After ""I am awake"", it was an empire that the audience and himself never imagined.Break the law and break the old framework to do crazy things that a dull person would not do. However, these things are just to continue the middle class life of the family after death. The rules, obligations and responsibilities are still deep in the bone marrow. How can we be a person who lives for ourselves, or how can we live?"

10.0,1 August 2023,"Breaking Bad is nothing short of a television masterpiece that leaves an indelible mark on its viewers. Created by Vince Gilligan, this critically acclaimed crime drama series first aired in 2008 and quickly captured the hearts of millions with its gripping storyline and exceptional character development.

The series centers around Walter White (played brilliantly by Bryan Cranston), a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher who, after being diagnosed with cancer, ventures into the dark world of methamphetamine production to secure his family's financial future. What unfolds is a rollercoaster of moral dilemmas, unexpected alliances, and the transformation of an ordinary man into a complex anti-hero.

One of the show's greatest strengths lies in its ability to delve deep into the human psyche, exploring the intricacies of good and evil. Walter White's character arc is a tour de force, as viewers witness his gradual descent from a sympathetic, desperate man into a ruthless criminal mastermind known as ""Heisenberg."" Cranston's portrayal of Walter White is so captivating that it earned him multiple Emmy Awards, solidifying his status as one of the greatest actors of our time.

The series also introduces us to a rich ensemble of characters, each with their own flaws and virtues. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman, a small-time methamphetamine user turned Walter's partner-in-crime, is equally compelling. Their complicated relationship forms the emotional core of the show, making it not just a crime drama but also a poignant exploration of human connection.

Beyond its outstanding character dynamics, Breaking Bad also stands out for its meticulous attention to detail. The writing is sharp, the cinematography is visually stunning, and the soundtrack effectively complements the intense storytelling. Every episode leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, as plot twists and unexpected turns keep them yearning for more.

Breaking Bad's exploration of the consequences of one's actions, the cost of ambition, and the impact of choices is both thought-provoking and harrowing. As viewers witness Walter White's transformation, they are forced to confront their own notions of morality and ethical boundaries.

Furthermore, the series doesn't shy away from addressing social issues and the impact of drug-related crime on communities. It serves as a cautionary tale, shedding light on the devastating effects of the drug trade and the toll it takes on individuals and society as a whole.

In conclusion, Breaking Bad is an extraordinary series that remains unparalleled in its brilliance. It has rightfully earned its place among the greatest television shows of all time. Whether you're drawn to compelling character-driven narratives, intricate moral dilemmas, or simply seek an enthralling viewing experience, Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. Prepare to be enthralled, disturbed, and profoundly moved by this unparalleled masterpiece of television storytelling."

9.0,13 May 2024,"""Breaking Bad"" is the best TV show I've ever seen. A TV series that doesn't need words to describe the splendor that this show represents. I was stunned by the characterization and change of characters during the 5 seasons, which are one more beautiful than the other! Walter White I think is one of the best protagonists in the history of cinema and is definitely one of my 3 favorite. Jesse is one of the best deuteragonists that cinema has ever presented, a perfect character. A character that I think is underestimated for the importance it has is Flinn, I love him. I loved Hank Schrader so much and I hated Skyler. Marie is a good character, but I never liked her. Mike is a great character that I can't wait to deepen with ""Better Call Saul"", and with him also Saul Goodman that I love so much. The various antagonists in the series convinced me a lot, especially Gus Fring, one of the best characters in the series. Gilligan's direction is sensationally beautiful and innovative, he had an incredible idea. The plot is a bomb and his writing is phenomenal. The level of photography is incredible, the images are iconic. EVERYTHING IN THIS TV SERIES IS ICONIC IN THE CINEMA WORLD. I have no words about the actors' interpretations: Bryan Cranston among all played one of the best interpretations of the story, but as he did an excellent job Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odernik, RJ Mitte and all the rest.

Now I talk about each of the 5 seasons: -The first season is in my opinion excessively hated. I loved it! The first episode is amazing and introduces the TV series flawlessly. Everyone says that the first season is very boring and is the worst: in my opinion it is anything but! It's a magnificent first season because it should be seen as an introduction to the huge and perfect story that will develop! It only serves as an introduction, and it does. Perfectly.

-In the second season much more things begin to happen. We are beginning to see the dangerous side of drug trafficking and the troubles that the protagonists will have to face. This season introduces the character of Saul: FUNDAMENTAL!. It took such a weird character to animate the whole thing, and he does it perfectly. I really enjoyed Gus Fring's introduction here. I also liked Jane who gave Jesse a moral boost.

-the third season animates things a lot: you can see the radical change of Walter who realizes that sometimes you don't have to use half measures. It deepens the character of Gus that interested me immediately and I loved the greater family involvement in writing.

-The fourth season, on the other hand, is on the level of perfection: here we can really see that the issues are no longer just related to money but are also beginning to enter the threatening and dramatic side of the series. I loved Jesse's biggest burn and his dramatic deepening. Hank is becoming more and more central in the story and I really liked this choice. This penultimate season I enjoyed a lot.

-I don't want to talk about the fifth season: PERFECTION ON THE SCREEN.

This TV series overwhelmed me, it gave me emotions that I had never felt before. I would pay to see it again as if it were the first time.

. Evaluations: 1st season: 9.95/10 2st season: 9.9/10 3rd season: 9.9/10 4th season: 10/10 5th season: 11/10 best episode: ""Ozymandias"" - rating: 12/10!

Worst episode: ""Fly"" - rating 9/10 Best Character: Walter White .

10.0,7 November 2020,"Finished this show 2 years ago, Everything that makes this show great is a testament to art itself, Vince Gilligan is the GOAT No doubt about it. But that's not all this show has to offer....Storytelling, Character development and justice, Cinematography, Acting, Direction everything is just top notch. When a lot of people say that this is the best TV show till date, I was quite skeptical but then I fell in love with it and I'm still feeling the artistic impact after 2 years. Great way to portray subtle emotions, intentions and reality of the characters, I have too many positives to point out in this show. Protruding ones, This is a must watch 💯"
10.0,19 April 2014,
10.0,12 September 2018,"Lots of TV shows come and go. Most of them go unnoticed. Very few TV shows manage to make an impact on the audience and out of those few some never leave your mind because they're just too good.

Breaking Bad is a show that will forever remain unforgotten and unparalleled because of its unique concept and also the brilliantly written plot and characters.

The character of Walter White itself is the highlight. I don't remember the last time I was so impressed with a character from a TV show. The way his character develops throughout the seasons is just wonderful. Bryan Cranston was absolutely wonderful in his portayal as the high school chemistry teacher turned crime boss.

Aaron Paul as his dimwitted and emotionally troubled assistant was also very good.

Overall this show is one of a kind and I've seen several shows trying to match up to this one but they failed miserably and eventually shut down. I enjoyed each and every bit of this show mainly because of the plot, brilliantly written characters and fantastic performances by the lead characters. It's no wonder it's the greatest show of all time."

10.0,23 September 2018,"Every element of this show leaves me awestruck.

Huge round of applaud for the greatest show ever made!"
10.0,6 November 2020,"Breaking Bad is the most exhilarating, fast paced show you will find, every action causes a reaction later in the story, this is Breaking Bad's greatest feature(in my opinion), they set up something and pay it off brilliantly. Other than that, the show's other strengths are the characters, who are brilliantly acted, the action, the tension, the writing, the cinematography, the production design and much, much more. I recommend that you watch this show and also go watch it's sequel film, El Camino, and it's prequel series, Better Call Saul."
10.0,9 April 2014,"Breaking Bad is as ominous and poignant as it is amusing and flippant, the escapades of the Chemistry Genius High school teacher gone rogue with an ex student is as comical as it is meaningful, but what really provides is how striking this series is as an enigmatically exceptional production that ceases to amaze on both levels of scope and scale.

From the beginning to the end Breaking Bad exceeds to captivate and involve the audience cognitively and materialistically, each episode holds equal to importance and intrigue; the choreography illustrates masterful simplicity in coherence with the plot. Throughout the series the audience is played emotionally. Empathy and apathy play fundamental roles in the portrayal of characters that never once become a tedious appendage to the bigger picture, even less significant roles are imposed as impacting and spur charisma and diversity into a story line that at first glance seems rudimentary.

Walter White, the main role in Breaking Bad is acted and directed in exemplary fashion, his pitiful situation reflects a superlative in character development and provides an ample perspective to the resultant outlet of his intentions. The family of Walter, while being implied as implicitly innocent actually come into interaction with the dark side of Walter White often, this continuity and differentiation between clandestine and regular give not only Walter White two sides of a coin but also his lifestyle and the subsequently subversively progressive nature of the plot.

Breaking Bad holds true to the realism and philosophy of ethical and morale situations, while also making these situations entertaining in a perversely farcical manner. It's this often uncannily insinuative implication of life's misdemeanours that makes Breaking Bad such an unimpeachable, refreshing and original achievement."
10.0,22 July 2018,"Starting with the story, when you hear about a drug dealer makes drugs ""methamphetamine"" and kills souls, you will hate him without knowing him of course, and here comes the philosophy of the writer and the way he writes which made me sympathized with that durg dealar in this series and with the other side at the same time, that thing revealed to me how the writer is genius !!

The superb thing in this series when it comes to the writing is each and every character had their own impact on the story in a way or another, the writer put so many details to make sure that ""death isn't the end"" so that even if the character dies it's affect will appear in the series sooner or later ..

And the last thing is the family, the great message that made me fall in love with this series is the family in which the main character of the series became a drug dealer and he knows that thing is illegal but he did it just for his family so when he dies he will ensure his family future and even if he died his family will always remember him and what he did for them.. for me that message was enough to make this series one of the best in tv history.."
9.0,21 January 2023,"If you're a series fan and haven't watched Breaking Bad yet, you're missing out the BEST series ever created.

This story will be never outdated, even after 10 years of production (last episode was in 2013).

One of the most interesting points in the series is to observe the evolution of each characters, the formation of character, what is considered ethical, the involvement between them, their standards of acceptance, in short, a great evolution that allows the viewer to understand the reason for each decision taken.

The way the plot is done: breathtaking!

Simply: WATCH.

And don't forget: watch the movie right after the last episode."
10.0,13 February 2023,
10.0,28 April 2022,"So, back in about 2010, I (living in Europe) stumbled across this series. After seeing the first episode, I had to immediately call my movie-buff-friend to tell him to go watch it right away! (Normally, we would wait until our regular meet on Sunday to tell each other about good new stuff we'd seen).

. He was also immediately hooked and we discussed the developments of our now shared soul journey every week. In awe of the next level writing, cinematography and high production values.

. I never re-watch series, but at the hint of another friend I have started re-watching Breaking Bad from the start. In the first 2 episodes, I spotted some questionable decisions. But hey, they are not hardenend criminals at this point, I'll continue.

. I just saw S01E03, with Walter sitting opposite of Domingo. The heart-wrenching struggle, sorrow, fear and consequences sunk in to the core again.

. I know now I'm going to watch this masterpiece all to th end again. And it will again not be easy. Breadking Bad is rightfully the all-time top of *multi-season* series on IMDB. Simply the best TV every made."
10.0,17 January 2022,"There's no denying it, this is the most fascinating show I've seen since I was born. I just found out about this show in 2014, and every day I watch many episodes continuously, then watch it again from the beginning. BB is like a delicious dish that you can eat forever, never get bored. It was perfect in everything, the content, the music, the setting, the production design, the cinematography, the acting, the characters, the twists, and the ending. Walter White is perhaps the most memorable and distinctive character in the history of movie and TV show characters. He is special not only in his position in the film (as the main character's transformation from good to bad) but also in his transformation in psychological depth. He makes us wonder why we support bad things so much, and we find all sorts of excuses to justify them. Since when have we been hypnotized by Heisenberg?

As the title says, Walter is really talented. And he is a good man. But no one is perfect. Walter simply doesn't accept that. To be more precise, he was allowed by society, the law and the people around him to not accept his own incompetence. Given his ability and what Walt did, he deserves more than he has, he deserves to be honored and admired, and appreciated more than that. And he knows it. The problem is, the things around him, his friends, his colleagues and his wife, always give him the feeling that he is just a normal person like everyone else, even a bit shy and easy to bully. Or at least that's how he feels and accepts that reality. A person who is inherently talented and is always proud of it, what would he think? The man of the family, Walt accepts the truth, but his pride does not. And when he realized his efforts were being turned into the success and glory of others, this hurt Walt even more. Lung cancer is just a drop of water that overflows an already full glass. And that evil pride won.

Watching Walter White transform into Heisenberg was truly magical and made me think alot. Does he love his wife? Yes. Does he really want to earn that money for his two children? Yes. But it seems that it is the conscience of a good person, which has long been swallowed up by that evil pride.

Breaking Bad is proof that a movie or TV show can become a classic without spending too much money and creating all sorts of fantasy things and monsters. The more I watch the last seasons, the more I see that the darkness in Walt is stronger and more reckless, at this point the good conscience in him has given up, but it still tries to find something to survive, like a redemption, Jessie-Pinkman. Walt sees him as his student boy, a testament to Walt's talent, Walt also sees Jessie as the son he wants to have, at least from Jessie's personality. Walt has always wanted to protect Jessie, just as the part of Walt's soul wants to save itself. However, even that is not enough.

It can be said, Breaking Bad is a gem of movies and shows, the greatness of the experience, the thing that can turn pride into tears, and turn those tears into emotions filled in the heart. You don't cry, your heart cries.

And I mean, Walter White is both a victim and a villain, a strong man, a weak one, an inspiration and a sinner. What a character! What a show! I don't want to say anything more. Should we sympathize with Walt and give him love? Or will we judge him for the evil things he has done? Maybe it's one person's point of view, or it's two streams of thought in each person. I respect all those thoughts. Anyway, I love this show very, very much!"
10.0,12 May 2020,"The ending of Niubi proves that the play is an insurmountable drama. When Mr White finally admitted, ""everything is for himself."" It has exposed the hypocrisy of the family thought that the United States has always advocated, and slapped those hypocritical mainstream dramas loudly. Human nature is selfish."
10.0,26 July 2023,"I'm on my 7th time around for Walt, and it's not lost its (crystal) sparkle. I don't know how it could be more perfect. I think even writers across this wonderful planet would have a game adding to this masterpiece.

It's such a lean story line, virtually no fat to cut from it. The only episode I'd happily skip is that bloody fly. Other than that......a joy.

The characters are so rich too. For me, the best kind of characters....you can't pigeon hole! They all seem to evolve into something completely different, not just Walt.

Even after 7 times around, it still makes me nervous to watch, and excited to see the next episode. You forget parts, then magically remember them.

Breaking Bad will not be knocked off its mantle any time soon. Bravo Vince!!"
10.0,18 May 2017,"An amazing series about a Chemistry teacher diagnosed with cancer who decides to make drugs. At first Walter's decision to make drugs is to make money for his family to pass away, but the real reason why he keeps doing it, is because those years that he spends making math are the times that he has felt most alive, ironically despite the fact that he is dying. What makes this series so good is Walter's character, watching him progress from this person who has never had any excitement in his life, to doing ""new"" things due to the fact that he is living as though it was his last day. I rooted for Walter through the end, despite many of the monstrous acts that he committed, due to the admiration I have for this amazing character. There are many other very well fleshed out characters who are all amazing, but not on the level of Walter Hartwell White. Also, every single soundtrack which is picked in this series fits in perfectly and suits the scene which it is put in."
10.0,2 June 2020,"Vince Gilligan is a genius. The story telling is just awesome. The direction is just perfect with Bryan's contribution to it. No matter how many movies or series I watch, nothing can replace Breaking Bad. The background story, the character arcs; hats off. 👏 That's how you tell a story and end as well. I hear people saying that it's a slow story. I don't know how can they think this way. I think the story telling of Vince is a gift from God. The way he focuses on every detail is an art. I mean, how can you love or hate a character if you don't pay attention to details. How can you think it's slow and boring! Better call Saul is another must watch show for breaking bad lovers. Another masterpiece. ❤"

10.0,16 November 2020,This is the second greatest show ever created. Right after game of thrones but not by much
10.0,10 February 2023,"""Breaking Bad"" is a multi layered story that truly tugs on your heartstrings. It tells about a journey of a chemistry teacher Walter White and his ex-student Jesse Pinkman going through the drug-dealing market.

It's the second-best rateds show on IMDb, a box-office hit and it is called the best show of all time. Does it deserve that tiel? I think yes.

As the show's focus is illegal activities, death aand blood are very common. The special effects are perfect, making gore believable yet not pretentious.

The actors are expressive and perfect for their roles. Starring Bryan Cranston, he delivers an amazing performance along with the rest of the cast, creating heartbreaking, powerful and exciting scenes.

There isn't a lot of music, but when it does appear it typically conveys the character's emotion/state of mind, which I think is a brilliant idea. It's an amazing show, and I reccommend it to everyone. It will always get a 10 out of 10 from me."

10.0,27 June 2019,"Breaking bad is a series that never get out of theme and tempo, it is a perfect example of ending a series on a high note, most of the shows don't cope up, the writing, screenplay, acting. Everything is top notch, and few of people have watched better call Saul, it's a sub series of breaking bad, and will give you goosebumps."

I really love this 2 seasons... season 4 is great and acctually better than season 1 & 2... I really admire this serial with all producers and actors/actresses...thanks all of them!
10.0,29 August 2020,"One of the best shows ever made. I dont even know if something like this will ever be made again. Its gonna affect you mentally, emotionally and in many other ways you cant imagine. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Everything you already heard about this show - is probably an understatement.

The acting in it is truly amazing. It probably is the best acted TV series of all time without a doubt. Bryan Cranston delivers one of the best acting performances ever, but the supporting cast is almost just as good. Usually, there is a dropoff in tv shows in movies; you'll have one or two great performances, but the rest of the smaller supporting cast is basic and average, but in Breaking Bad, there are truly excellent performances and the roster runs deep. This is the kind of show or movie where even the smallest roles are memorable. There really isn't one bad actor in any part of the series, and that's part of what makes it so good.

Once you are finished watching this masterpiece, watch it again because there is so much attention to detail that you can't pick up on in your first watch. There are all kinds of foreshadowing, symbolism, references, and little details that will make you appreciate it even more. This is not a show where one watch is enough. It gets better every time you watch it. Also, be sure to learn about the making of it, behind the scenes, the story of how it got made, all the Emmy awards and other awards it won, the records it set, what other prestigious names in Hollywood like Anthony Hopkins said about it, and all of the greatly written articles on it. It will really help you cope with it ending. But a warning: it is so addictive and good that you will probably find it difficult to let go, and every other show in the future will pale in comparison.

If you haven't seen Breaking Bad yet, do yourself a favor and experience this once in a lifetime classic. Avoid any spoilers, and it will be ten times as good like it was for me and first time viewers during its airing."
10.0,13 August 2018,"Breaking Bad is a show about two men deciding to make crystal meth, but what is magical about the story premise is that is what it feels like watching Breaking Bad. You can not help but be hooked and want to watch more and more and more and more. Aaron Paul is phenomenal as Jesse Pinkman, Pinkman is very, very dumb, but he is so lovable and despite being a drug dealer still stands up for what is right at times. The amazing thing about Jesse Pinkman is that he clearly he has a consciousness when it comes to killing people or ruining people's lives. He does not mind when they are drug dealers, but when they are good, normal people he cares and stands up for what he believes in. Cranston is amazing as suburban husband and teacher Walter White. The audience sees White morph from a wonderful, thoughtful husband into a cruel, callous drug lord. White becomes an entirely different person and even gives himself a new name for this new persona, but I will not spoil that. The writing is absolutely superb, the only bad episode that I can remember is called ""The Bug"". Breaking Bad may be the best show of all time, but that has to be one of the worst episodes in the history of tv shows. Please skip that episode, but otherwise it is absolutely amazing. I watched this show for the first time at a very young age and it definitely had an impact on me as to whom is involved in the drug world and erased any curiousness I had as to how drugs would make me feel. I suggest this for teenagers, adults, or anybody who wants to watch amazing television while discouraging drug use at the same time. Breaking Bad definitely does not glorify the world of drugs, it simply states what the drug world is like. Please, please watch it, you most certainly will not regret it!"
9.0,24 February 2020,"I'll keep it short: Each episode may not be better than the last, and there are certaintly ""filler"" moments in the show like any other, but never has a show been able to get you so invested into its story and characters like this one. Each season is better than the last and each big moment will have another to one up it till its finale, which isn't the best of all time, but certaintly better than Game of Thrones. Don't care who you are, you have to watch this show. It may be slow at first, but it is so worth it till the end. No matter what."
10.0,9 February 2023,"Breaking Bad is the only television program I have ever seen that is as consistently authentic and compelling. Unquestionably, this is one of the best shows ever, and it keeps getting better.

The adventures of Jesse Pinkman and Walter White are legendary. These are some of the most masterfully crafted characters to ever be created by a pen on paper.

I can't stop praising the acting and cinematography. I was seldom distracted by the acting since some of the shots are complex pieces of art. The performances are so good that it seems inappropriate to call them performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad is able to retain the level of interest and technical excellence seen in only the finest of movies, and in terms of tone, every episode is constantly engaging.

I enjoyed myself while watching the show one of the best experiences of my pathetic life."
10.0,11 July 2021,Feeling sad for completing the series within 2 weeks.
10.0,11 October 2018,"This kind of TV comes around once in a generation. It is as addictive as the substance they create in the show.

Every line, beat and thought is so perfectly thought through that it's exact definition of the sublime.

I don't think any review will ever do this show justice, it is just one of those things that no matter who you are or what kind of TV you like, you must watch BB. It will enhance your life but also leave you with a hole, which very few TV shows will ever be able to fill. And that's OK, because you will have experienced this, and therefore life is complete."
10.0,13 April 2023,"It's no secret that ""Breaking Bad"" is one of the greatest television series of all time. The show's captivating plot, brilliant cast, and masterful directing all contribute to its well-deserved acclaim. At the heart of ""Breaking Bad"" is the transformation of Walter White, played to perfection by Bryan Cranston. White's journey from a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug kingpin is nothing short of riveting. Cranston's nuanced portrayal of White makes it easy for viewers to become invested in his story, even as his actions become increasingly reprehensible.

The supporting cast is equally exceptional. Aaron Paul's portrayal of Jesse Pinkman is a standout, imbuing the character with a raw vulnerability that makes him both sympathetic and endearing. Anna Gunn is also noteworthy in her role as Walter's wife, Skyler, adding depth and complexity to a character that could have easily been one-dimensional.

The show's creator, Vince Gilligan, deserves much of the credit for the show's success. Gilligan's writing is taut and suspenseful, while his directing brings a cinematic quality to the show. The use of color and framing is particularly notable, with each shot contributing to the overall narrative.

""Breaking Bad"" has received numerous awards and accolades, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, 2 Golden Globe Awards, and a Peabody Award. These accolades are a testament to the show's lasting impact on the television industry.

One of the most impressive aspects of ""Breaking Bad"" is the way it explores complex themes such as morality, power, and corruption. The show is not afraid to take risks, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in mainstream television. It is a bold and uncompromising series that demands the viewer's attention and rewards them with some of the most memorable moments in television history.

In short, ""Breaking Bad"" is a television masterpiece that will stand the test of time. Its captivating plot, brilliant cast, and masterful directing make it a must-watch for any fan of the medium."
10.0,25 August 2018,"This show was absolutely brilliant. Wonderfully written and beautifully carried out by the actors. I was hooked after just the first episode and could NOT stop binge watching. There is never not a time when it's boring in any way, it kept my attention throughout. Truly an ""edge of your seat"" kind of show, and that's just an understatement. Watch it now!!! And be prepared to have lots of spare time as you will definitely want to binge watch."
10.0,27 September 2019,Best series in the world like all of it is like a lesson for your live
10.0,12 January 2019,Pure gold...... Watch and enjoy! Walter White shines throughout the entire season.
10.0,15 January 2019,"Bryan Cranston is the best actor on this show but I have got to say Aaron Paul comes profoundly close to being nearly as good as Cranston, both of their characters are are amazing and what complete this show of course along with all of the other actors."
9.0,4 January 2019,"I know I'm probably writing this review for no reason, as there are already hundreds of thousands that you could read, but I needed to express my admiration for this utter work of art. In my opinion - and many others - Breaking Bad is the best TV series ever created. The basic plot greys the lines of morality by making the protagonist the villain. This has been done before, but never have I related to a criminal like this. The story structure is completely solid and the progression always works to further the main plot. The writing from Vince Gilligan is phenomenal; I can't remember an episode of the series that I disliked. The story was always furthered in each episode. Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston portrayed their roles flawlessly, I don't remember a second thinking something was unrealistic or cheesy from them. But while Cranston was entirely spectacular, I never felt the same connection with Walt that I always felt with Jesse. Aaron Paul absolutely blew me away with his performance, portraying Jesse Pinkman as a pitiful addict who you just want to comfort. Overall, this series has no flaws. I will recommend it to everyone of my friends until they all love it as much as I do. 11/10 stars, thank you Vince Gilligan for making history."
10.0,13 February 2023,"Breaking Bad was an amazing show. Once you start watching Breaking Bad from Season 1, it will feel a bit slow but gradually as the story progresses, it becomes strongly addictive and gets very interesting. Everything was perfect about this show in my opinion: The acting was perfect, the storyline and script of the show was very good; the way everything takes place and how the plot suddenly thickens when something significant happens is certainly very good. The plot twists were very surprising and interesting. The VFX of one of the major plot twists was surprisingly good. The art/props department certainly made the famous half face well. The soundtracks of Breaking bad implemented and highlighted the key points and storyline very well. Another thing I really like about this show is how Walter changed from a poor weak high school teacher to the biggest meth kingpin of America running the largest meth manufacturing operation in US history. I also really liked how the relationship of Walter and Jesse forms over time and how they go through all these situations and continue cooking with each other; they have this connection between each other like father and son; like the child Walter never had. The things they go through and how they are there for each other is very amazing. Besides, Walter and Jesse were a really funny duo and made me laugh a lot during the show. The funny thing is that Jesse was originally set to be killed off during season one! In my opinion this show was quite funny at times. Overall, it was a very well thought out drama TV series and I think it was amazing. Breaking Bad also achieved 92 awards and 248 nominations and it has also been nominated for numerous accolades, winning five American Film Institute awards for Television Program of the Year. I am thinking of re-watching the whole 5 seasons again at some point in the future. That's how good it was."

10.0,29 October 2020,"While the second season was somewhat weak (compared the rest of the show, that is), every episode of Breaking Bad is an achievement in entertainment as we know it. Despite its slow start, this show does a brilliant job at transforming Walter White, a sad, dying man who wants nothing more than the good of his family, to Heisenberg, the only man to rival Gustavo Fring in the methamphetamine business. Every actor in the show, Brian Cranston, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Anna Gunn, R.J. Mitte, Betsy Brandt, and so many more show themselves to be heroes of the acting craft. From every monologue to every look to every hysterical breakdown, the cast is mind-blowingly good. The same can be said for writing. Ingenious action sequences as well as quiet, heartbreaking interactions. Nobody can emulate this dialogue. It is a treasure. without getting into spoilers, I can really only say to watch this show now if you haven't already. The greatness of this show can not be overstated."
10.0,12 May 2020,"The middle-aged male teacher, who is poor and down-to-earth, with his genius and courage to see the dead as the end, has made an exciting career of poison teacher under the surface of a quiet life! Full of tension plot, natural and appropriate interpretation, full score work."
10.0,15 September 2023,"Breaking Bad is almost perfect The only thing that puts people away is its slow pase, I hated it too, especially in the first two seasons (It took me over a year to finish Breaking Bad because of it) but I began to apprieciate it because it built up tension, gave the viewer more reason to care about the show's main characters, because the slow ""nothingness"" that happens throughout episodes is mostly their day-to-day life and without fancy camera angles you could buy this as recording of actual real life people, because the show keeps things realistic especially in these slow moments.

The story? It's almost perfect (Once again it gets a bit rough around the edges in the first two seasons) The acting? It's almost perfect And overall it is a really fun and emotional experience.

It really toggles the problems of society, masculinity, war on drugs and the criminal world. If you like these subjects you will really find something intresting in what the show has to say on each of them.

Definitely recommend I just wanted to write about the slowness of Breaking Bad because that's the only thing that keeps it from being a 10/10 That's why I give it a 9 Go watch it if you didn't!"
10.0,6 June 2020,The best series in the world .. good actors good events
10.0,12 July 2021,"I have watched around 25-30 TV shows and I couldn't take my time or I didn't had any intension to write a review. But this show made me write. Yes! This is the top rated TVshow and it is worth the spot. At starting of the 1st season I thought it would be overrated but when I finished the 1st season I couldn't stop watching this, such a hooker. And this is the best ever TV show made💯"
10.0,17 February 2023,"I have seen many shows, movies, and other cinematic films before, but I have never really seen anything like this.

Breaking Bad was something that I was expecting to be good when I had started watching it. I was right, It was good. Fast forward to season 3, it wasn't good, it was great. Onward to season 4, it wasn't great, it was amazing. Onward to season 5 and the final 3 episodes, (Ozymandias, Granite State, And Felina) It wasn't amazing. It was perfect.

To start off, the beginning of the show was good. It had irony of a loving family man becoming a drug dealer, and it seemed on the surface like your typical drama show. I don't have much to say about the 1st season other than it keeps you on your toes, and has a very well set plot. It's set like a ticking bomb, you never know when it's going to blow, you just know it will, and everything will fall. However, although not much is shown in season 1, this show has symbolism - LOTS of it. Essentially, the main depth of season 1 is to not get into drugs, but the show builds on itself flawlessly as each season adds more tension and power.

Now, the 1st season is where it barely starts. Many people say it may be slow, or out right boring. Although I personally enjoyed season 1, it is probably the worst season of the 5. Not because it's bad, but simply because of how good the other seasons are.

Season 2-3, Walter begins to grow more powerful, and he definitely lets this power get to his head. It's probably around here when you can tell more of the meaning and overall message of the show. Also, you almost kind of bond with the show, or get attached to it. This may happen in many shows, but it really does show how good the show really is. The more complex a show is, it is often much more original. That's what breaking bad is. It's very original, from the irony to the characters, it's very realistic, relatable, but somehow also so original you have no idea what to expect. From one season to the other, it always leads to so much variety and dynamics that It's hard to get bored of the plot, or if you don't pay attention enough, you might not be able to keep up!

Now, in season 4-5, you have been with the show long enough to know everyone. You understand all the characters and you kind of get used to the flow of the show. These final parts are where that attachment to characters come back to bite you. I don't want to really become too specific, but it's these moments where the ticking bomb finally comes back and blows up. I don't mean to sound like I'm saying this simply because I like this, but every good quality you can think of in a show, that's in the last seasons of breaking bad. Betrayal, drama, division, representation, dynamics, suspense, depiction, is all packed into a creative and elaborate way. Shows that go on for hundreds of episodes couldn't even compare to what this short 5 season 62 episode show has to propose. I think the length of it is perfect too. It has the ending that you kind of gradually thought would happen, but never really thought the show had the audacity to go there. The final shot of Walter staring at the camera will really have you gaslighting yourself.

To all the people who have seen the show, if you asked them to find similarities between Walter in episode 1 and episode 62, they probably would've been able to list 3 or 4. But if you asked that same person to list differences, you would be sitting there all day. Yet still, the show doesn't lose it's main theme, or at least too much to the point where it's simply not what you wanted and liked about it in the beginning. Watching the people change. Watching the surrounding and the setting change. Everything flows into the complete disaster that had been it had been slowly developed into. Unless you have some sort of problem with the format of the series, this show is for you."

10.0,8 November 2020,"I finally checked out the series recently. I mirror what all the positive reviews say here: great acting, writing, great scenery of New Mexico and the dessert, as well as a good soundtrack as well. Love America's Horse With No Name.

I'm sure I'll check it out again in the next few years if not months to catch things I might have missed the first time around. Without spoiling it though I know the common theme is Walt Broke Bad to set up his family financially for his treatments but I bet to differ a little on that.

As I said I'm sure I'll re-watch it"
10.0,12 October 2023,"Breaking Bad is one of the best series that you can watch and enjoy, and it is highly recommended that you watch it.

This series is spectacular and attractive for all movie and series lovers, and all viewers and critics of this series love it Breaking Bad series is one of the most popular and top series in the world and imdb.

This series is now at the top of the top charts and is very spectacular And you don't get tired of watching it and you don't want to finish it at all and you want it to end indefinitely And you will face the wonderful game of Walter and Jesse.

And many thanks to the creators of this beautiful and spectacular series."
10.0,27 October 2020,"Director Vince Gillian has crafted the best modern villain tale within the world of Walter White. The audience explores Walter at his darkest levels watching his tactical self-centered decision making and how it impacts everything around him.

The story from beginning to end is compellingly driving us off a cliff, yet the drive is through a slow motion lens allowing the viewer to settle in a enjoy the ride.

The major characters are brilliantly depicted and portrayed through the masterful cast! And yet even the smaller characters of Badger, Skinny Pete, and Gale are relatable and delightful.

Breaking Bad's storytelling style, sets the bar so high, it may be decades before another heavy weight show can spar with its genius."

When I first started watching I tried to make myself hate the show due to the love it gets, but I just couldn't, it was to amazing, I really started loving it towards season 3/4. If you're seeing this and u haven't seen breaking bad/bb, please watch. You won't regret it, even if it isn't your ""taste"", that won't be a problem, because this show is for everyone. I usually watch comedy but breaking bad has changed my mind about everything, it changed my life. Greatest show ever."

The story starts with this great teacher who, as the chapters go by, turns into a evil person and extremely selfish who only wants money and power but everything has consequences.

The production of the movie is completely insane, all the characters with particulary clothes and all the scenes was filmed in nuevo mexico so gives you a very good perspective of how it is in real life.

In conclusion, it is the best show ever, all the drama, highs and lows of each episode will keep you entertained for a long time."

10.0,21 January 2022,"It's simple, this TV Show is the Mother of ALL the TV Shows.

The way of development of each of the characters, the ambivalence between what is good and what is bad, what is easy and what is fast.

Brian Cranston in the best role of his life, without a doubt an impeccable performance, without mistakes, without attitudes that create confusion about where his character is headed.

Hank without a doubt another fabulous character, his pride, his insistence like a hound looking for the bone.

Gustavo Frin (Giancarlo Esposito), one of the best antagonists of all the TV series, the personality changes, a good man who is dedicated to working in his business and the next second, the transformation of his face and gestures it's magnificent Many people have told me that they got bored with the beginning, however from the end of season 2 and the beginning of 3 everything explodes and a maelstrom of uncertainty and bad decisions begins that lead to wanting to see one more chapter and another until finish the series.

I had seen Lost, Game of Thrones, Prision Break, Sons of Anarchy, The Sopranos, Peaky Blinders and more, but all of them have one fault, the endings never close up like BR BA.

The ending of BR BA is magnificent and for that at least for me, is THE TV SHOW you need to see."
10.0,12 May 2020,"What really makes Breaking Bad one of the most moral TV dramas in history is that actions lead to results. Whether it's out of pain, greed, fear or panic. You are bound to take the consequences for your actions, not for your inner scheming."
10.0,21 November 2023,"The character of Walter White is at least as tragic as Jake la Motta in the movie Raging Bull. La Motta was losing everyone who loved her as the price of the evil and violence she committed, but she was still naive. Walter White is never naive, but both of them are tragic in the sense of paying the price of being himself: La Motta lives without understanding what kind of person he is, Walter takes revenge for living as an insignificant person until that day when he gains power; He changes and turns into a bad person - despite his conscience reminding him of himself with a black fly from time to time. The character of Walter White is a character that has now taken its place in the history of cinema and television that's for sure. Breaking Bad should be watched and thought about."

10.0,10 May 2014,"I registered with IMDb just so I could write this review. I am almost finished with Season 5, and I think this may well be the best TV drama of all time. I got onto the bandwagon late, and already knew how it ended when I started watching the show, but that was basically all I knew. I cannot express in words how amazing this show is. There are so many amazingly interesting characters/performances, but I have to say that Esposito as Gus Fring is unbelievably great as a villain, and Bryan Cranston is sublimely flawed and interesting as White. The relationship between White and Pinkman makes the show, and the decision not to kill off Pinkman in the first season is THE thing that turned this show into a phenomenon. Whoever made that decision, I assume Gilligan, turned an interesting and great TV show into an all-time great TV show. ""I am the one who knocks"" and ""I won"" are two of the greatest TV-drama lines of all time.

Minor Quibbles: So far, Idon't think season 5 is as good as the others. I don't really buy that Beneke would just not say anything after what happens with Skyler's guys.

I know how it ends, I don't think season 5 is quite at the level of the others (so far) and I still cannot wait to finish the series."
10.0,16 December 2021,"Breaking Bad is a netflix series directed by Vince Gilligan. The series stars Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul who play the role of drug dealer and associate. The story of Breaking Bad is a chemistry professor and his associate who do drug trafficking. It was originally released in 2008 january 20. As of now 5 seasons and 62 episodes are avaible.

My opinion : Breaking Bad is a very good serie with action, and suspense."

10.0,30 April 2023,"Breaking bad is an excellent series. Netflix, instead of wasting their money on originals, should license more series like this. Just like Rough Diamonds Breaking bad is an exception to many of the recent Netflix originals. They are authentic, they have no drugs no explicit sex, and no foul language. Queenmaker was another great series with a clean ending; you don't have to wait for season 2. House of Cards, Money Heist, Delhi Crime, Queen's Gambit, Night Agent, and Marcella are good examples of what Netflix should focus on. In the past Netflix licensed excellent TV series like Revenge so that we could watch them without commercials. That was the biggest value proposition for us. Many of the recent originals are pretty bad, full of explicit sex, drugs, foul language with f and mf words. Many have actors who do not belong in the script but are there to satisfy diversity. We love the Korean, Northern European, some other foreign shows."

10.0,13 April 2023,"Everything about this show was litteraly perfect, best development ever created. One of the few shows that got better every season, like season 1 was like an 8/10, season 2 was like a 8.5/10, season 3 was like a 9/10, season 4 was def a 9.7/10 and season 5 was litteraly a 10/10. The acting, the writing, the pacing, everything was perfect. Went from a high school chemistry teatcher to the most biggest and dangerous druglord ever. Bravo Vince! This show is what made me get into television. Perfect in every single way. And the spinn off(better call saul) was by all mean a surprise(no spinn off have ever been geeat)for how good it was aswell. Breaking bad is the best show ever made no doubt."
10.0,7 November 2020,Every now and again there emerges a truly engrossing series that surfaces issues like no other. I honestly cannot say at what point I became hooked but it was doubtless quicker than substances in this series. An absolute must watch in the current day obscession with drug-related dramas. You litterally have not lived until you have seen this...and then there is Saul to follow up.
10.0,20 December 2020,This was the first se with my man tougher and we couldn't stop watching. It's still on my top 5 liste and now we have seen a lots of good serie
10.0,17 October 2023,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be."
10.0,25 April 2022,"What made this series a worldwide hit? Plenty.

Memorable cast, engaging script, which is obviously well-crafted and meticulously thought out, flawless cinematography and impeccable direction. Dialogue is on-point, without being superfluous, and occasionally witty.

The lessons it imparts about the human condition are down-to-earth and thought-provoking.

And the characters. Wow. Seldom does one watch such an assemblage of highly competent, immensely motivated actors whose performances light up the screen. On top of the topnotch performances of the likes of Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anne Dunn are quite amazing actors. Come on down: Bob Odenkirk, Giancarlo Esposito (Angry Black Man), Jonathan Banks and Dean Norris not to mention Laura Frazer.

There is clear effort to experiment with creative storytelling and the series pulls this off. A case in point is how episode 10 of season 3 was conceived and directed. It's an episode unlike the others.

A consolation for the countless fans is the on-going prequel ""Better Call Saul"" (which was introduced in episode 8 of season 2), which is Saul's origin story, and the special, El Camino, which continues the story of Jesse Pinkman."
10.0,10 February 2018,"Grate Story, Fabulous Acting, Super Strong Scripting allover its too good the best i ever saw, and most impotent Became more and more crazy and thrilling after every episode ."

If you want to understand TV series "" Breaking Bads "" better/completely/wonderfully ,, You should/had to watch "" Better Call Saul"" 1st. This TV series is Breaking Bads 2. And Breaking Bads 3 is Good Girls TV series. By watching Better Call Saul you can find the answers of these question.

1-How did the mob boss change the Laundrymat to a drug laboratory ? Who did constract the laboratory under the laundrymat?

2-How did the retiree policeman conect to mob boss and start to work for him?

3-How did the lawyer connect to the mob boss?

10.0,1 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is an amazing show. It's well written, well acted, and well shot. Bryan Cranston is fantastic as Walter White, and the story is exciting and unpredictable. The show's portrayal of the drug trade is realistic, and the characters are relatable and interesting.

What I love most about Breaking Bad is how the story builds over time. Each episode is carefully crafted, and the tension and suspense keep you engaged. The show has a satisfying conclusion that is both emotional and thought-provoking.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a must-watch for anyone who loves great television. It's a powerful and compelling story that will stay with you long after you've finished watching."

10.0,28 September 2022,"Breaking Bad is very good from start to end. It has good actors and actresses. They play their roles very well. For example the son of main character is half disabled like he can't walk without walking stick, he can't speak well and he's so good at playing the role. It's like he's a real disabled. Character development is good and the plot is good aswell. And finally the show has non-stop action besides the beginning it has a slow beginning but when it comes to the plot, the main event it gets very good and exciting. And there are some more spin offs like more shows and some films. The film is about the time after series. And the series about Breaking Bad is the one of the characters individual series. It tells about his life story and lots."
10.0,20 November 2020,Although the series breaking bad is a great drama it had two scenes which i absolutely dreaded and shouldn't have been so gross. one was a kid shooting a man and another a man shooting a kid. morals of this series is at its lowest ebb although it's presentation is phenomenal with a dialogue par excellence.

10.0,10 October 2019,"As the title says, I've just finished watching breaking bad through to the end for the 4th time. What an absolute masterpiece of writing, casting and acting. Infinitely watchable. The best TV series I've ever seen and I envy those who have yet to see it."
10.0,24 August 2018,This was such a dramatic show that had you feeling for the characters until the end. Some parts were a little tedious but they made up for it in other ways like the elaborate plans and over the top characters that were cast to their roles perfectly. The amazing makeup and costume designs were always perfectly executed and clever in what they represented. In my opinion this is THE BEST show ever made!
10.0,9 July 2021,The last episode just took my brain to all the reply of past 61 episodes.
9.0,3 March 2023,"A good start, better mid story and perfect ending! This is a soap opera for men haha! If you're bored and you never ever watch this TV series before, bro i envy you. Because you can watch it online straight two to three days straight. I remember watching this before and wait for an episode once a week and when the series ends it took me several months again to wait for another episode. This TV series is a masterpiece I'm 100% sure that you're gonna love it and it so good they made a prequel of this TV series and the title is ""Better Call Saul"" I'm not gonna spoil it just watch it! You're going to love Saul Goodman! Haha."

10.0,13 January 2019,"Wooow! Stop! Im emotionaly broken and very sad. This Show was the best Show i have ever seen! You cant compare it with any other series. The performances of the Actors are really really good + the writing and music of this series. This Show deserves more than 16 Emmys. When i think about this Show i think like i have to cry. This Show was more of just a Show.this series has moved me emotionally and spiritually into the spell. Whenever I hear the music or when I start to watch small parts on Youtube I find it very sad that I can not see this series again for the first time and I will never forget my feelings after the finale (S05 / 16 ""Felina"") . Im shocked."
10.0,12 January 2019,"Breaking Bad is without a doubt a show that deserves the 10/10 rating. Everything about it is just incredible right from the very beginning of the show (with a fantastic pilot) and never breaks down in its scenic drive to the finish. The show has a unique use of cinematography, story and a fantastic soundtrack but where the story really shines from most other shows is in how real these characters and world feels along with how the show never forgets about the consequences of the character's actions and how they can never truly get away with what they did in their past.

In this way, the writing is some of best in film or television, every character never loses track of who they are and their personalities even as these horrible things happen to them or their loved ones throughout the whole show. Every character is just fantastically thought out, written and incredibly well acted. You never feel as if they are just actors playing characters for even one second, they always seem to embody that person which makes the drama and crime even more emotional, disturbing and gut-punching.

There's nothing bad I could really say about the show apart from maybe some episodes in series 1 were a tiny bit slow (which is totally made up for in how it is just setting up the premise/characters) and that some of the science early on isn't entirely realistic (which you wouldn't notice that much if you don't practice chemistry) but that's only a minor nit-pick that doesn't effect the rest of the show.

The show just feels unique in how gripping and disturbed the balance between the disturbing nature of bad versus worse (there's no real good guys) and how no one really wins in this type of situation. The DEA can't beat the cartel and the cartel can't get the DEA off their back. It's a perfect anti-villain show and character drama that never loses a sense of the story and thriller elements. It's not just focused on making one thing good, it focuses on making everything great from it's characters, story progression, writing, cinematography and acting, it fully deserves to be classified as a near perfect show.

If you haven't seen this, watch this show, it is absolutely fantastic. You can watch one a night, you can binge watch it like I did but no matter which way, it is just a great experience and character study."
10.0,19 November 2018,"Best TV series I've ever seen!!! Cast is beyond fantastic,story,thrill,light,camera,music,.... This is what we call A Masterpiece must see show!!!"
9.0,4 September 2021,
10.0,13 July 2020,"This show is amazing. There are some minor plot flaws but overall this show is amazing. The characters Walter White (Bryan Cranston), Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), and Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) were phenomenally cast. The acting, writing, plot, pace, camera, editing, were excellent. You feel like you're in the movie. You need to watch this on a big tv screen.

Vince Gill was a writer for X-Files, my other favorite show. This show had to be good too and it is. This show is gripping and will have you hooked. If my eyes didn't bleed out of its' sockets, I'm sure I could marathon this entire show.

El Camino and Better Call Saul are also good. Better Call Saul comes before Breaking Bad and El Camino comes after. Watch everything haha, BUT DEFINITELY WATCH BREAKING BAD!"

8.0,18 September 2019,"This is the best piece of television I have viewed so far, ever. I can say that with resolution. From the highly subtle and sensitive character development, to the outrageous and surprising twists and turns the plot takes, every scene is a necessity in the development of the story. No stone is left unturned. At no point do you feel like you want to scream ""why are you doing that?!"" and if you do, there is a definite and clear reason as to why the characters act in the way they do, often far more clever and calculated than any viewer could predict. It is a carefully constructed combination of dry, dark humour and horrifyingly gory, depressing scenes, yet, beautifully paired with experimental cinematography, it manages to leave you constantly assessing and evaluating true morality. The plethora of particular camera angles, use of various filters, the brilliant soundtrack and the ambience of each scene is always somewhat upbeat, despite the many dire situations that the characters involve themselves with. Having watched this series multiple times, I am truly never disappointed by a scene. Each scene is carefully constructed to lay bare the questions that we would ask within ourselves throughout different phases of our lives. Even, for example, the episode where Walt becomes obsessed with a fly - that is another very intricate yet important character building expression. Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and Co truly capture an essence within our humanity that we ourselves cannot necessarily comprehend until we are exposed to empathissing with these emotional situations, through this series. Extremely accessible and relatable whilst also totally shocking in parts, it is a rollercoaster ride throughout, leaving you feeling simultaneously defeated yet very much empowered by the end."

I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. Perfect show, congratulations to the director and all the actors. The beginning is perfect, the end is perfect, I don't think it could be better. The scenes are always done in the best way, episodes are always eye-catching and addictive. History made with everything in mind, full of details. 10/10."

10.0,10 July 2021,Just finished watching it for the first time and it makes me feel ill knowing i'll never be able to watch ut for the first time again.
8.0,8 June 2015,"Breaking Bad is a show that stays with you for a long time even after you finished all the seasons. It is brilliant writing, acting and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.

I must admit my first shot at watching BB did not go well. I found the first episodes quite boring and didn't feel that interested in watching any more. Months later I decided to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. This is one of those shows that you can watch 5 episodes in an evening and feel like you can't wait for the next night to watch some more.

I have watched BB all the way through twice. Once on my own and once again with my partner who I persuaded to watch it with me. He is very fussy when it comes to TV shows and does not get drawn into them easily but, like me, he was hooked on this.

Like any other TV series BB does have its boring parts but this more than makes up for it with the rest of the show."
10.0,26 November 2017,"Who hasn't watched Breaking Bad? it has become a cult show in so many countries at a level that hasn't happened before. Everyone says that it's great, that no other show can top it, and they are right, but why is it?

How can someone not like a guy, a chemistry teacher in his fifties, who looks at his life and says ""fuck it"" and starts cooking meth, in the same way we like the character of Kevin Spacey in American Beauty. He kills the monotony in his life, which makes the plot full of possibilities in many aspects of the story.

The most important trait of Breakin Bad is the originality of everything. It doesn't have a source material. Everything looks fresh, with no clichés and no trite elements. And if you are a movie buff you may have caught some references to classic movies, especially, Tarantino's movies.

Each episode is powerful, filled with emotions and character development, interesting dialogues, and situations of all type. Every character, every scene, every dialogue, every shot is meaningful for the whole of the story.

From episode one to the final episode the series reached a climax, and level of expectancy never reached by any other TV show.

I've watched breaking bad three times, and I've always found some new deep peculiar meanings in the plot.

I have no doubt that this is the best TV show of all time."
10.0,19 August 2020,
8.0,1 February 2018,"I heard many great things about this show. People claimed it to be one of the best shows on television. After seeing it, I must say that this television series is a pure masterpiece. The acting, writing, directing, camerawork, sound design & music, editing, and every other aspect of this show is executed flawlessly. This is more than a television series; this is a piece of art. Vince Gilligan has hailed himself as a genius by meticulously crafting this perfect series. I absolutely recommend this to anyone. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is the best television series of all time."
10.0,5 May 2020,Breaking Bad is seriously an awful experience! A one time expirience. This tv show's got perfect story perfect cast perfect screenplay most importantly a great finish. I watched the pilot episode a long ago but don't know why just didn't continue. And I just finished this sensational show and became an all time fan. If anyone trying to discontinue like me after pilot episode I give a big no. It's a story of a chemistry teacher who's suffering from lung cancer and just wanna leave enough money for his family after him. But this man get into this meth world and becomes a king of it. As of that realizes he gained a lot of hatred from his own family. It's got a mesmerizing plot. Vince Gillian just made us see how a very good person can change down to a very dark person with adding a pure blue meth! Salute to vince!
10.0,29 November 2017,"To me, the ending of a TV series is a very important thing. Many great shows fail in the ending which doesn't make them remember long.

But in case of Breaking Bad, the story building from season 1 to season 5, character development, the inevitable fate of these characters, friends and family of Walter White make this show even more memorable. As a complete ended TV series BB is still the best. No matter how good Game Of Thrones is, the ending will tell the difference of greatness between GOT and BB....."
10.0,9 August 2019,Best show ever . I mean this story tells how a good man make bad decisions and gets away from his family. Because all he did for its family he says in the end he says All I did it for me . That's what satisfaction to him . And he feels while working He's alive. 🔥💯

10.0,26 January 2019,"This is a stellar show that you should not pass up. I watched it without my wife, as she was not interested. After I finished watching it, I told her she HAD to watch it.....when she did, she beause addicted to it, too.

The entire cast is great, but CRANSTON owns this - you believe every change he goes through - no matter how small the change may be- he is a most amazing actor. He carries this series to a higher high.

My wife said she was even sad when she finished watching this series. I told her she would love it, and she surely did!"
10.0,16 July 2017,"Walter White is the salt and pepper - innocent man, two masks, cruel and merciful in the same body. Great acting, Bryan!

Brilliant!"

10.0,2 June 2020,"Everything about BB is almost perfect.The plot,the actors,the direction,music you name it.Oh and the attention to detail is on a whole another level.The way each and every scene is shot, the camerawork, it's a treat.I was rather skeptical about the way they would end it but they did a pretty good job there too not leaving almost anything unattended.My favourite character, which would surprise a lot of people is Saul Goodman which is played by Bob Odenkirk.I wish I could see him till the last minute of the last episode but anyway they made another show based completely on that character which I'm gonna see next.But most importantly this show has the potential to almost change your outlook towards life.It leaves a deep impact on your brain it's unbelievable.Almost every major character in the show leaves a vibe on you.I mean to say that if now I see Bryan Cranston in another movie or show I won't see Bryan Cranston, it's only Walter White that I will see.Likewise for all the others.So yeah if you haven't seen the best tv show of all time go treat yourself."

10.0,25 July 2020,"Breaking bad is a series which was made for the people who want something like adrenaline push in their life. It starts with Walter white who is a high school teacher at the age of 50. He starts suffering from cancer. He has a son who is a cripple and his wife is pregnant. He have to earn money for them. He finds his school student Jesse Pinkman who is doing meth business. They together start doing the business. From the first season the characterisation of the crew is done very incredible. The showcase of every character is amazing in a way. You got Walter white who turns from Mr.Chips to Tony Montana. If someone ever ask me to direct a mafia movie I will definitely take a lot of inspiration from breaking bad.

Cast: This is the most accurate cast that would portray the roles convincingly in the world for this series. Bryan cryanston has Walter white is the best portrayal of a character in any series. Aaron who portrayed Jesse Pinkman is any supporting character will not make you convince at this level. The duo combination makes you one of the best in the business."
10.0,2 April 2024,"It is truly great all seasons in all respects and there is nothing to criticize in this masterpiece There is a connection between the events in terms of the past and the future, which is very crazy, and this can be seen in the third season, and the characters are beautiful and great. I feel sad for those who did not watch the series, because they missed out on a lot of events, and everyone who watched the series knows what I am saying We spent a lot of time watching, but we did not feel like we were watching. Rather, we enjoyed a lot. Thank you for this work, and I do not think there is anyone who will compete."
8.0,18 July 2018,"A little wink there for GOT fans, hehe. All my love to you brothers! So, speaking of this specific work of art, I would say entertainment rarely comes with such compelling story, script, actors, drama, direction, intrigue, turns and twists, outcomes and begginings as this. Many have said it and many others will stand for it: Breaking Bad is point break of an era of TV. Enjoyable experiences as good as it gets."

10.0,26 April 2022,"A mindbending show which narates how a person can become accustomed to own dark part by letting it grow bit by bit and become monster without ever realizing it.

This show can guide you into depression so be vary of it. Also make sure you watch it and complete the first season. Its my favorite but many dropped at that.

And lastly dont really expect any one episode to be great its simply accumulation of many to make this masterpiece!"
9.0,11 September 2023,"This is undoubtedly one of the greatest series that have ever been created, and with it began the era of TV series. It is the type of series that even after a while you can rewatch with great pleasure and fully feel the masterpiece of the series. Not only thanks to the interesting plot twists, which you can not predict, but also developed characters that are interesting to watch. If by some miracle you haven't watched the series yet, and especially if you haven't caught spoilers, you are lucky to feel the first emotions from the first viewing.

The series is made flawlessly. How good the direction, camerawork, sound, music, actors and much more unites this series, just a titanic effort. And that's just what lies on the surface, because underneath the series has superbly developed characters, plot, visual styles, philosophies, and that sort of thing you can think of. The series from start to finish is made to make a masterpiece, not to pour water on.

Minuses are very hard to find, but I think everyone will find something to dig into, as you can't please everyone. I, from my bell tower, can only warn that I personally found season 3 and the first half of season 5 a little less cool/tightened. That doesn't mean they're bad, don't get me wrong, it's just that you can't be perfect everywhere and it's definitely not necessary to change anything. It's just that the directors decided on, my guess, a slightly different direction, or maybe it just happened, but they go right back to being perfect. I only noticed this after a second rewatch after a long time.

This is a series everyone should watch when the time comes. Absolutely no regret for the time spent. Not only will it keep you from getting bored, but it will leave a wonderful aftertaste and give you a new experience to think about."
10.0,11 May 2020,All time favourite show classic story 😍 Acting😘😘
8.0,30 July 2023,"I'm personally not the type of person to watch this kind of genre of a series, I starting watching it on a spontaneous whim, glad I did because it's bloody tremendous.

The whole story, writing, acting, throughout is bloody brilliantly put together. I especially like to give Bryan Cranston a massive shout out for his outstanding performance, such a talented actor, I loved his performance prior to Breaking Bad, for example in Malcolm in the Middle, Bryan's skill & talent contributes highly to this series in being a such a success.

Overall this series is a masterpiece, and well worth the watch."

10.0,5 September 2021,"Simply put, it's one of the best TV series I've ever watched. It will have you binge watching, had me and the mrs up till the small hours every night. I cant praise it enough. Gripping stuff."
10.0,25 October 2018,"Breaking Bad is definitely the best show ever made. The show follows Walter White as he is transformed from a meek high school science teacher who wants to provide for his family after learning he has terminal cancer into a ruthless player in the local methamphetamine drug trade. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman, Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name ""Heisenberg"" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, Walt eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the Drug Enforcement Agency through his brother-in-law Hank Schrader, the local gangs, and the Mexican drug cartels and their regional distributors, putting his life at risk.

If you haven't watched it yet it's a must. I give Breaking Bad 10/10 cause it's awesome!"

10.0,29 December 2018,"Just because you intend to do good, doesn't mean you will. A person is not bad, just because they do bad actions, and a person is not crazy, if they do crazy actions.

Such is the story of breaking bad. A crime fantasy that everyone has atleast once thought of. Yet the greatest horror someone with a family could ever dream of.

Ultimately, I loved the show, and admire it."
10.0,8 February 2021,To be honest I'm not done watching but I'm about to finish the 4th season whatever the series is good new story not seen in any other thing I watched it has good script writing perfect acting with a good story again. at the end I'm just a normal watcher.

10.0,11 March 2023,"Well first of all, the show's Pilot episode might just be the best written one ever, every important character gets introduced, Walter's challenge (his sickness) gets introduced, and more stuff. Then, the show's conclusion was sort of excpectable, (at least for me), however they executed it amazingly. The show has so many amazing dynamics, Crazy plot twists, Some funny scenes. But most importantly, Breaking Bad has maybe The absolute best cinematography ever. You can really see just how cruel the world can be, and how realistically they made every decision. Acting was also on point. Especially on season 6 episode 14. Anyhow this series is an adventure, and an experience that everyone should have."

10.0,24 July 2023,"I watched this show after it ends by about 10 years and I felt like it is a show for all times and all places I liked how the incredible writing makes the show more interesting by every episode to build some incredible moments at every season if the show were slow at the season begining it became crazy at the end of it. I liked the characters building and how they are developed and their decisions and openions changes by every season. It was really a breaking bad . There is a lot of iconic characters in the show like Gustavo fring , tio Salamanca, and the great Heisenberg. The acting in the show were amazing specially from Bryan Cranston . In my opinion breaking bad is one of the greatest shows I have ever seen."

10.0,24 May 2013,"Evil isn't a light switch, it's a journey and it's a journey that Walter White has been on since the story began. Walter White could have gone far in life as a scientist but instead he took the easy path and became a lowly high school science teacher with a disabled son and another child on the way. Then he discovers he is dying from lung cancer. What is a man to do? Well this man starts to manufacture meth as a way to cushion his family for when he is gone. This show is very dark and yet very well written. There is not a needless character in the story. From the brother-in-law DEA agent to the wily lawyer, from the increasingly suspicious wife to the Ne'er-do-well business partner, Everyone has a purpose. In essence you are watching something truly beautiful. A good man breaking bad.....and taking everyone else down with him."

Character development is a masterpiece, plot is a masterpiece, cinematography is great, almost perfect casting. Even the smaller roles are a product of great casting. Even the costume, clothing and color design is design is telling its own story.

Bryan Cranston is one of the most talented and versatile actors ever. Like most actors, he has his weaker roles...this is not one of them.

Aaron Paul a product of perfect casting, also a fairly strong actor.

Final few episodes are great. Finale is one of the best TV history.

Most of all, its a product of genius writing."

All the episodes are out and available on Netflix and other streaming services, and i guarantee you that you won't get bored.

10.0,27 July 2018,Comedy by actors show wit of the writer's and director who have supported the gesture. Gestures like making 'drugs' are based to the comprehension that drugs kill us. The drugs that involve the medicine industry are steroids and antibyotics which are harmful to the internal system of the body but the other sort of drugs are recreational meaning for achieving sleep. The actors and actresses while watching these Television Show were adults who had a relation who was mortally going to die. The example through the years are that actors who performed the series were doing their payed jobs and did not reveal if they worked pro bono or without money. Attention to the forty minutes series lead us to encourage the importance of being self agonized to continue living. Living after a certain age is the important attempt to 'not give up' to death which like in race hears the start and knows the stop. The attention to death is a passage to create our final chapter with illumined attention. Observing slips and falls in life because after an age the body is ready to have children over wasting the 'grey matter' that goes in using the brain behind the actions that daily we are legally here to perform after our birth. Responsibility like that of the persons in this Television show where drugs that killed humans in real life are consumed or created rather. The sequence of courage is to bring an important achievement in direction and screenplay is the cinematography of 'Breaking Bad'.

This series was so loved because it was brewed in a lab."
10.0,6 May 2022,"It's hard to say what hasn't already been said, about this groundbreaking series. The story will completely hook you in from start to finish, and makes you wanting even more after it's conclusion. I've just finished my 3rd viewing and always find something new to analyze each time. Without giving too much away, the synopsis goes like this; A high school chemistry teacher is diagnosed with lung cancer. After going on a ride-along with his DEA agent for a brother-in-law, he decides to apply his knowledge for chemistry to produce methamphetamine with a former chemistry student of his; street smarts combined with knowledge of chemistry. From there, the show only gets crazier after each episode. If you've never seen this show, immediately stop what you're doing and check it out. I can't recommend this enough."
10.0,21 February 2023,"This show is a cinematic master piece and captures every little thing you would want from a TV series. The characters and acting are the best of the best. The pacing is perfect and you are never bored throught your watching time.

Characters: All the characters are terrific and are all amazing and you can relate so many of them.

Setting: All the locations used in breaking bad are amazing, realist and never look like they have been filmed in some studio or greenscreen which makes the full program more realistic

Theme: The theme is quite depressing and sad when you see what happens to all the characters as nothing ever really goes to plan.

I would recommend this to anyone out there looking for an amazing show to watch."
8.0,1 June 2023,"I have watched all of the best tv shows, like the walking dead, prison break, chernobyl, and sopranos. But breaking bad is different. It has the best acting ever. Not to mention the most amazing character in television ever Walter white. Every episode has a deeper meaning. And even the episode fly has a deep meaning. It is a cinematic masterpiece. Aaron paul delivered the best acting performance that made my skin crawl in granite space if you watch the episode you will know what I mean. The complexity of the show is also crazy. Ozymandious 5-14 is the best episode of tv ever made. Anyways this is the best show ever."
10.0,19 July 2020,"The show's character's mindset is the pillar of the show, written in a great way that forms one of the most fascinating storyline ever to exist."
10.0,19 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is a crime drama series that follows the transformation of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and decides to produce and sell methamphetamine with his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to secure his family's future. The series is set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and consists of five seasons and 62 episodes.

Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time, and for good reasons. The series boasts a compelling story, complex characters, superb performances, stunning cinematography, gripping direction, and a memorable soundtrack. The series explores themes such as morality, identity, family, loyalty, corruption, violence, addiction, and survival. The series also balances dark humor, suspense, tragedy, and action in a masterful way.

The series starts off with a simple premise: a dying man trying to provide for his family by breaking bad. However, as the series progresses, the stakes get higher, the conflicts get deeper, and the consequences get darker. Walter White becomes an anti-hero who gradually loses his humanity and morality as he becomes more involved in the drug world. Jesse Pinkman becomes a sympathetic character who struggles with guilt and trauma as he witnesses the horrors of his trade. The supporting characters are also well-developed and have their own arcs and motivations. Some of the most memorable ones are Skyler White (Anna Gunn), Walter's wife who becomes conflicted about his actions; Hank Schrader (Dean Norris), Walter's brother-in-law who is a DEA agent; Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), Walter's and Jesse's shady lawyer; Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a former cop who works as a fixer; Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), a ruthless drug lord who poses as a legitimate businessman; Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), a sociopathic criminal; and Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), a cunning executive who secretly deals with Walter.

The series also features some of the most iconic scenes and moments in television history. Some of them are: Walter's ""I am the one who knocks"" speech; Jesse's ""Yeah science!"" exclamation; Walter's ""Say my name"" demand; Hank's discovery of Walter's secret; Walter's phone call to Skyler after killing Gus; Jesse's escape from captivity; Walter's confession video; Walter's machine gun attack on the neo-Nazis; Walter's final goodbye to his family; and Walter's death in the meth lab.

Breaking Bad is not a flawless series, however. Some of the criticisms that have been raised are: the slow pace and lack of action in some episodes; the graphic violence and disturbing imagery that may be too much for some viewers; the unrealistic or implausible aspects of some plot points or scenarios; the unsympathetic or annoying behavior of some characters; and the controversial or divisive endings of some seasons or episodes.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a masterpiece of television that deserves all the praise and acclaim it has received. It is a show that will keep you hooked, entertained, moved, shocked, and amazed from start to finish. It is a show that will make you question your own morals, values, and choices. It is a show that will stay with you long after you watch it. It is a show that you should not miss."

10.0,4 August 2019,From the best 25 series ever and it deserves more rating than this
9.0,20 October 2018,"What's so crazy about this show is that each season gets better than the previous which literally never happens with TV. In fact, my favorite episode is in the final three episodes of the last season."
10.0,30 September 2013,"I knew I wanted to wait till the series finale had aired to write a review about Breaking Bad because I kept holding out to see if the show would surpass its potential like I thought it could. It never quite made it past it's potential, though parts of seasons 2,4 and 5 definitely dabbled in that territory. This is not to say that just living up to the potential isn't a bad thing. Breaking Bad was often a great show and a great story to follow along with. It also boasted two incredible performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul throughout. The evolution of the series and of those two characters is something special to watch. The show never quite reaches that next level for one gaping reason, and it's partly because of it's two leads... the shows supporting characters are for the most part boring and irrelevant. When I think of some of the best dramas ever (Justified, Lost, Fringe, Damages, The Wire) the big thing that they possess that Breaking Bad doesn't are relevant characters. It's a lot easier to take your story in lot's of different directions and have relevant sup-plots when they involve characters that grab your attention. Breaking Bad struggled to have that throughout, with key supporting characters Hank, Walt Jr.,Marie, or Skyler (ohhhhh Skyler :S ) providing the spark for any good sub-plots. One great supporting character is Saul, but mainly for his comic relief. Most of Breaking Bad's supporting character's are ones with only a season or two story arc like Gus, Mike, Jane and the Salamanca's. Though the show doesn't quite get to the heights that some of other great dramas, it's still thoroughly entertaining from the opening episode to the satisfying series finale."
10.0,21 July 2022,"I watched up until Season 4 Episode 2 where I finally gave up because I couldn't handle how boring this show was and how much it wasted time, literally most of the scenes have 0 meaning and the dialogue in them is completely insignificant and silly, I'm pretty sure seasons 4 and 5 are better but honestly I had enough with this show I can't stand it's boredom anymore, I'm watching shows to get entertained not force myself to continue."
10.0,11 October 2022,"Truly disgusting! This series is definitely worth watching. But not for the reason the critics tell you. I'm not sure if it's the fault of the writers or Bryan Cranston, but the Walter White character is by far the least interesting and unbelievable character in the series. You can literally fast fwd through whole sections of episodes w/ him and his family and not even notice. They spent the first 80% of the series presenting W White as a nerdy, ugly (sometimes gross), belligerent man who's constantly rudely barking at everyone to his own demise. Then they expect us to except him as a ""Clint Eastwood"" badass. I didn't buy it. That being noted, outside of White's dweeby family, literally every other character is interesting, well written and captivating. Aaron Paul is 10X the actor Cranston is in this drama. I say watch this for sure, but ff through the stupid, boring White family filler."
10.0,16 March 2021,"Sheer brilliance by Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul."
10.0,26 May 2021,What a show!!! Just amazing. You get involved with every character you get to see every characters good and bad side. It may be slow but that's what engages you. It's not just the ending the quality is from the start. A chemistry teacher to drug lord what a journey.
10.0,28 February 2021,"I bet you've heard it a thousand times people saying 'Breaking Bad' is the best TV show you'll ever watch and they are right. This series is so well rounded and with its plot, acting and cinematography that makes a must watch. Please give this series a go"

When chemistry teacher, Walter White, is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given only two years to live, he decides he has nothing to lose. He lives with his wife and teenage son, who has cerebral palsy, in New Mexico. Determined to ensure that his family will have a secure future, White embarks on a career of drugs and crime. He proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling meth with one of his former students. The series tracks the impacts of a fatal diagnosis on a regular hard working man and explores how a fatal diagnosis affects his morality and transforms him into a major player of the drug trade."

10.0,24 March 2021,Such a tragedy that it's over and won't come back. Sad but this is also a fact that makes the show damn perfect.
10.0,25 February 2021,"Words cannot describe perfection. And yet, perfection exists. It's this series. After watching it for the 8th time and knowing almost every dialogue by heart, I still notice details I had not seen the time before.

How many years did Vince Gilligan spend working out all these characters, all these plot twists, all these sceneries, this psychology?

Vince Gilligan and his actors should get the one and only platinum Oscar for making the perfect series, never to be equalled, ever.

Generations have lived and not seen Breaking Bad. What a waste..."
10.0,30 March 2021,The best show that I have watched till date. The main reason for its success is that they had a finished story before the start of first season itself. It was a great story and the actors took it to another level. Walter white and Jessie pinkman will never let you forget them. A must watch.
10.0,29 March 2021,All I want to say is just watch it instead of seeing the reviews. Once you watch it you will be telling your friends to watch it.
10.0,25 July 2021,"While it's not the greatest series ever (that honor still belongs to the Sopranos) it is in the top 10.

The writing is outstanding, but it lazily relies way too much on coincidence and contrivance. When the writers need Walt to screw up and say too much, they put him on pain killers or get him drunk. The direction and location shooting are brilliant. The creation and backstory for the very believable Los Pollos Hermanos and Madrigal was fantastic. How 'Gus' was dealt with, was absolutely riveting TV. The Season 4 ending was intended to be a series ender, because a 5th Season was uncertain. I would have been very pleased with that as I had lots of problems with Season 5 and the series resolution. Sometimes, less is more.

However, the creator, Vince Gilligan, doesn't seem to realize what a monster he created with the character of Skylar (Anna Gunn). In fact, the actress and Gilligan were appalled by the fans turning on Skylar and properly assigning her much blame. She even wrote an op-ed about it telling the fans ""they were wrong! Skylar was not a bad person."" Stunning arrogance! She was the author of every bad decision and ill-conceived crackpot idea that brought Walt down. She is a control freak who thinks she has skills way beyond her abilities. She carries this I-ALWAYS-know-better arrogance that backfires every time, and then she blames Walt. In S4: E3 Open House, when Walt buys an expensive champagne to celebrate, investment mogul Skylar freaks out saying they have to play the role of being flat broke. Yet, they are celebrating buying a car wash for $800K and when Walt leaves, he will return to his very expensive condo. But, of course, Skylar is always right. She is the Queen of passive-aggressive behavior. In the intervention scene for Walt, I would have taken that talking-pillow and shoved it down her throat!

Even at the Party, to celebrate Walt's great news, Miss Moral My Ground, has to throw a strop when Walt's reaction to the news doesn't conform with hers, and of course, she never lets anything go. She can never, ever give Walt a break, but yet she is willing to give large sums of money (not hers) and even commit felonies for her worthless boss. When it all comes apart, she is up to her self-righteous eyeballs in the conspiracy. When she goes into her 'scared act' in Season 5, someone should have asked her: ""We'll Miss Skylar, the bad guys were going to wipe out your entire family and your incredible husband stopped it. Would you rather it turned out differently?"" No, what the control freak is scared of is that she realizes she is no longer in control and that scares her to death.

I absolutely despise Skylar!

Bryan Cranston has proven that his performance in this series was no fluke and he is a first-tier movie star. His Walter White is an extremely complicated character, driven by so many competing factors. He is, at heart, a good man trying to do what's right for his family and himself and is absolutely, freakishly loyal to his disloyal, low-life, constant-liability partner, Jessie. But, he's also a man who has been bullied by his wife and other life experiences into accepting fate, rather than creating his own destiny. When he finally gets a chance to be the King of his domain, all of his inner demons and frustrations are unleashed. I never understood why two old pro's like Walter and Mike were so at odds with each other. I mentioned the lazy writing earlier, using convenient coincidence or character manipulation to further plot points. One of the worst examples occurs in S4: E5 Shotgun, when Walter can bury 'Heisenberg' with the police and incredibly, stupidly decides his ego is now more important than his and his families safety. Horsepucky! The writers write Walt as the smartest guy in any room, then when the plot needs it, the stupidest guy on the planet-lazy writing. The remaining, unresolved question, that was never answered in this series, is why did Walt continuously put everything on the line in order to keep saving the totally worthless, ungrateful, reckless, dangerous Jessie Pinkman.

Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul) is also treated way to kindly by the writers. He is not the drug dealer with a heart of gold. He is weak, weak, weak. Walter saves his life time and again and he still does not get the proper loyalty and respect from Jessie. 'Gus Fring' said it succinctly in his first meeting with Walter: ""You can never trust a drug addict."" Jessie is constantly writing checks that Walt had to cash. I quite enjoyed the beating Hank threw him. Pinkman was a master screw-up who was constantly putting others in harm's way because of his stupidity whilst skating by because everyone else pitched-in to save his sorry self. Poor little Jessie, it's always someone else's fault. I was so sick of his self-indulgent feeling sorry for himself. Walt made Jessie a multi-millionaire; he protected him; saved his life countless times.

The big Jessie/Mike episode, S4: E5 Shotgun, was absolutely absurd. Gus is running a $100M operation which could not be funded by some dead drops with small bags of cash. And the arch with Jessie sobering up completely and becoming focused and hard, is ludicrous plot manipulation by the writers.

Note in S4: E10 Salud, when Jessie does the cook alone, he manages a 96.2 purity. Recall when Gale was explaining to Gus, at the very beginning of their venture, that he could 'cook' a 96% purity every time, but that Walt's 'cook' was 99+ and the difference between 96 and 99 was huge. Oddly, the cartel, who would certainly have already tested Walt's purity, celebrated Jessie's inferior 'cook.' Jessie was an extreme liability and should have ended up in a hole in the desert. The original plot called for his early death, but he became a fan favorite. Note to producers: Don't let focus groups drive your narrative.

But, short of that outcome, harnessed in an underground Hell, spending the rest of his life making meth, was the perfect poetic-justice-ending for this detestable creep.

The supporting cast are excellent, led by Giancarlo Esposito. He creates a multi-faceted bad guy who is the opposite of the usual Hollywood psycho crime boss.

Dean Norris (I don't think or buy that 'Hank' would have responded as he did when he realized it was his brother-in-law that was 'Heisenberg.' He would have handled it as family, not as law enforcement).

RJ Mitte, what a sweet kid, and Betsy Brandt, what an annoying nag. David Costabile's (Gale) appearance is brief, but like everything Costabile does, it's very memorable.

Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks (The first time I watched it, somehow, I missed that super quick shot of Mike Ehrmantrout in the hospital in the Season 3, E 8: I See You) are so good in this they star in the equally good, maybe better, spinoff: 'Better Call Saul.' This series was also Jessie Plemmons big break.

Worst Episodes: Season 3: E1 No Mas; E9 Kafkaesque; E10 The Fly; E11 Abiquiu; Season 4: E2 Thirty-Eight Snub; E3 Open House; E4 Shotgun; All of Season 5.

Best Episodes: Season 2: E8 Better Call Saul (One of the all-time great introductory scenes of what will become a legendary character); Season 2: E9 4 Days Out; E12 Phoenix; Season 3: E6 Sunset; E13 Full Measure; Season 4: E1 Box Cutter; E10 Salud; E11 Crawl Space; E13 Face Off (many people think 'Ozymandias' is the best episode of the series, but I think it's this one, and it would have/should have made the perfect ending to the series.)

Best Season: Season 4.

Season 4 and E13 Face Off were planned/written to be series ending. Walt ending the series with ""I won"" would have been the perfect ending for me. I have loads of problems with Season 5 and the resolution of this series.

Worst Season: Season 5."

10.0,23 August 2021,"This show gets so much right but in all the seasons and every episode they write the girls so poorly, They are all the same character: annoying, bossy, nosey, and extremely flawed and unintelligent. This is with every single girl character. Not a single one in the show does not have those traits. It's a glaring issue."
10.0,12 March 2021,This series is the best which I watched.

10.0,18 March 2021,"It's one of the best shows I ever seen you can watch it with your family, it get better and better every season especially the last one."
10.0,30 April 2021,"I watched the entire series 3 years ago and rated it a ""10"". Then I moved to Albuquerque--nothing to do with the show--and I noticed what a total dump this city is and how the filth is whitewashed on the show. Also, the family dynamic of the Whites is very constrained. The family scenes are painful to watch--like they are total strangers to each other. Skyler's character is annoying. Finally, my second viewing of Bryan Cranston has been negatively affected by his embracement of left-wing politics and roles (i.e. Playing the communist writer Dalton Trumbo). I was watching a film with Amy Adams the other day and I said how much I liked her. Why? She's attractive, she's a great actress, she gave up her first class seat on a plane to a soldier and she doesn't advertise her politics. The last is especially important: you don't want to piss off half of Americans, unless you're a moron.

In conclusion, the writing and the plots of ""Breaking Bad"" are second to none--especially in Seasons 3-5 but the family scenes are much too slow and for the reasons listed above, this show is an 8/10, down from 10/10. ""Breaking Bad"" should not be the 4th highest rated show, ""The Sopranos"" is much more deserving of that distinction."
10.0,14 August 2021,"I finally had time to rewatch ""Breaking Bad"", and it has been just as fun as the first time. Definitely one of the best TV series ever made in terms of writing, direction, and acting. Popular series tend to grow stale over time, but the quality is uniform throughout the five seasons here. Everything is crafted so carefully that even the subplots and fillers are worth it. It's basically a crime drama with a lot of focus on exploring the depths of all characters. It's not a new formula but has the perfect balance between action, black comedy, introspection and tragedy. The cast is what makes this series so unique: even though the spot is on Walter and Jesse, the side characters are just as iconic and meticulously written that even potentially boring daily life sequences and family drama events are entertaining. Gus is one of the best villains in television history, but does he really count as a villain? I understand that he could not stay around forever, but after he is gone I couldn't help feeling the void that he left. Hank didn't get the same recognition, but I personally thought that in the end he was one of the most likable and multifaceted characters, and the one with the most realistic development.

Even though I enjoyed the whole series, the first two seasons are by far the best in terms of pacing, development and realism. It's impossible not to binge-watch mid-season one to early season three. Things get bigger and more complicated in later seasons, but basically rely on the same structure and situations of the first two. Season three and four introduce great characters like Gus and Mike, but season finales apart the pacing significantly slows down. A lot of situations also start to repeat themselves: Walter and Skyler have the same conversations every single time, Jesse gets manipulated by Walter and turns against him when finding out, Jesse loses himself and gets saved by Walter in some unorthodox way, etc. Season five tries to change the game a little and mostly succeeds, the second part in particular offers a lot of great moments as all storylines start to close. The ending was maybe a bit low-key, but it felt like the right thing to do without getting too unrealistic and leaving loose ends."
10.0,21 March 2021,Simply the best series ever . Period I have never ever watched something with so much intense and impatience in my life. Watched all seasons in a week
10.0,1 March 2021,"Bryan Cranston is the #1 reason (sometimes I think he's the only reason) why this show is incredible.

The other actors (Bob Odenkirk!) do a great job, the writing and camera work easily draw you in, and the premise (from science teacher to criminal mastermind) is exciting. But Cranston is such a talented, likeable actor who immensely helps the show earn the 10/10 rating.

I adore a series that shows that the writers carefully planned every step. In great detail, the show tells an interesting story of a man who slowly becomes a villain."
10.0,30 January 2013,"It is the best TV-series I have ever seen. The performance of the cast and the direction is just so amazing that u will never know what to expect. The jokes are funny. Over all The series is very entertaining and you cannot stay without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most of the people including me didn't know what would come.

I loved this series the first time I watched it, now i've seen it more than 3 times and i still love it and want to watch it. The music was also good and the acting was the best. A must watch series!!!!

i m eagerly waiting for fresh episodes, yet to release in march 2013 i feel very bad when i can not get this series very easily in India.. but after all i feel very happy to enjoy show."

9.0,12 June 2011,"if uve seen some and you like the general style then id say you are in for a special period in your life.

when someone asked me what it is (really unknown in Europe at the moment), i said it's a bit of a genre of it's own, being a mix of suspense (The Unit type of thrill), and black comedy within tragedy; i.e. it has serious stuff in it as well / is thought-provoking.

i really hope they will keep it up for the 4th season.

p.s. id skip episode 4 of the first season though, and maybe the 3rd too, i don't remember about the third.

p.p.s. many will disagree, but i think it's on par with The Wire, if not better :)"
9.0,26 March 2021,
10.0,16 June 2016,"By the time I started watching this show, it's been a year already since it's end. The show was very praised and called the greatest show of all time by many. I didn't binge-watch since while the show is very good, it wasn't that addicting for me. Anyways, I'll now start reviewing the show season by season.

Season 1 - It's not bad, but it's all a set up really and it has only 7 episodes, so when I finished this season, I was like:""So this is really the greatest show of all time?"". Pilot episode was great and promising, but then the middle of the season was kinda dragging. There was some great acting, of course but it's all very small compared to the rest of the series. Then episode 6 came and I was amazed and I was expecting a lot from the finale, but it felt really anti- climatic. It was better than episodes 2-5, but it still wasn't anything special like episodes 1 and 6. See, the thing with Breaking Bad is that sometimes it may seem really slow and even pretty boring at times, but when it gets good, then it's DAMN AWESOME! And that was pretty clear even here, but this season is still a huge disappointment and the worst of the show. 6/10

Season 2 - A huge improvement over Season 1. We get to know more about the characters and their problems, it's pretty intense at times, some people call this season boring too, but it wasn't really boring to me. It started off pretty intense and episode 2 was extremely intense. After that, it gets a bit slower again, but there is a stand-alone episode which is an absolute perfection. It's episode 6 and it's called Peekaboo. After that, it's not boring at all, at least not for me and by the end of the season is where Walter's breaking bad really starts. And he's not the only one who is breaking bad here. It also affects some other characters and changes them in later seasons. And the finale is much more fitting here and has quite a cliffhanger. 9/10

Season 3 - This season was pretty good, but for me it's kind of a let down after Season 2 that very pleasantly surprised me. It's really slow for the first 5 episodes, but then episodes 6-8 make up for it, especially episode 7. The next episodes are also very good, but it feels like some of them are only appreciated for their climax. And the same case is with me because not really much happens during an episode, but then there comes a terrific ending, I'm talking mostly about the last 2 episodes of the season. And some people may call episode 10, ""Fly"", just a pointless filler, but I really enjoyed it. The whole episode was stand-alone and didn't have much to do with the main plot, but for me it was well worth a watch. So, at the end, I can say that this season is pretty decent, but not as good as Season 2. 8/10

Season 4 - OK, that was amazing. In my opinion the best season of the show. It may have a slow start, and even middle, but it's not as slow as it can be and it's enough to keep you interested. But the last 4 episodes, oh boy! That's the most intense thing I've ever seen. Especially the end of episode 11, ""Crawl Space"". I've never been so scared in my entire life. Just the way the last scene is shot is brilliant, and the soundtrack and Bryan Cranston's acting makes it all even better. I literally got a panic attack and I could feel my heart beating in my chest like it's going to burst out. Just incredible! And the last two episodes were almost as incredible as this one. This season may have a slow start, and maybe even middle, but the last 4 episodes make up for it all. 10/10

Season 5 - The one that ends it all. By now, Walt completely broke bad and this season gibes you such a mix of emotions. One more thing about this show is that you can't simply have a favorite character here. They all have a good side, but they are all really flawed. After all, they are just ordinary people and that's the main reason this show feels so realistic. You don't know how to feel about some characters and one moment you can't stand them, but the other you completely feel for them. Or vice versa. In this season, that happened to me with literally half of the characters. This season has only a few boring episodes and there is always something interesting happening in each episode, at least a small part. And I appreciated Aaron Paul before, but he truly amazed me in this season. He should be in more good movies, because that way he could get an Oscar one day! And I don't even need to say anything about Bryan Cranston. He's fascinating. This season was very dramatic and tragic at times and when it ends, you just can't believe it's over even tho it's all tied very well. And while this season was very good, I still appreciate the suspense of Season 4 a bit more so that one remains my favorite. 9/10

I'm so sorry to say this, but while this show is very good, it might be just one tiny bit overrated. Please don't kill me. But I still think everyone should watch it because some moments in this show are better than some of the greatest movie scenes. But it felt like it lacks substance at some parts, so I'm not giving it a 10."
10.0,21 February 2021,Seen it over and over again an know I'll see it again
10.0,14 January 2013,"Seasons 1 and 2 are good but it gets really (really) good on season 3. At first i thought that everything will happen very fast and he (the main character) will be king of everything and all. Wrong! the show takes its time and that makes it more realistic about the difficult decisions that must be taken. Most episodes are really ""quite"" with a hint for next episodes or with one define moment. What i really love is the ironies and how everyone/everything are being connected with the story along the way. Watch it if you like slow, clever, realistic and a little bit hard core movies/series. it's not ""Tarantino style"" hard core but has its moments!"
10.0,21 February 2021,"This is television at its very finest. Five seasons of pure gold, with not one bad episode, consistently high calibre in every department - storyline, character development, and.acting. Many episodes are slow burners but they always hold your complete attention. Throughout the five seasons we get to know each character well, and eventually have an emotional attachment to their stories and where they may be heading.

Its fabulous television The best TV show I have seen."
9.0,3 March 2021,I think this is the best well deserved series ever. I know you want the 2nd as much as we do. Hopefully.
10.0,28 March 2021,
9.0,15 April 2020,"I have to confess that I wasn't a huge admirer after the first couple of seasons. In fact I left it for a year or two, before coming back to give it another shot. I don't agree it's the perfect TV series as many here argue, but it is a very good one.

Let's dispense with the negative first. I found the pace of storytelling slowed alarmingly every so often. This was my main problem with the first couple of seasons and even later, with episodes like The Fly, where the story arc (s) just seemed to stall and the writers appeared to be spinning their wheels. I also had a more minor issue with RJ Mitte playing Walt Jr. Whereas initially in the earlier seasons he looked pretty much the part as the teenage son, in the later seasons he just began to look too mature to be playing 16 year-old Flynn. I do accept that he would have been a difficult character to replace, but imagine if he'd been killed off. Now that may have been interesting.

Breaking Bad aced it with its cast creating many memorable characters. In Bryan Cranston, they scored an incredible actor with a huge range, who seemingly effortlessly is able to convince us, that this mousey chemistry teacher, has the smarts to become a major drug player and in the process, transform his persona across the series.

The supporting cast are wonderful. I loved sisters, Skyla and Marie, not just because they were fine actors, but also because they looked like sisters; one blond and one dark-haired. Dean Norris playing Marie's husband Hank, was an outstanding land-bound Captain Ahab, ever chasing his mythical white whale in drug lord Heisenberg. Giancarlo Esposito as Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring, the Chilean high-level drug distributor and fried chicken king in Season 3 & 4 is scaringly good. I also enjoyed seeing Jonathon Banks's Mike Ehrmantraut, gradually build up to playing a very prominent role in the series by Season 5. He is such a seemingly confidently laconic, but at the same time, intense character. Then in Season 5 we are introduced to a couple of unforgettably attractive scoundrels in Jesse Plemons's well-mannered Todd Alquist and the woman he longed to get closer to, Laura Fraser's fearful, but deadly, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

The New Mexico locations, especially those of the desert variety make an exceptional background to the action that frequently occurs in that sort of environment and the plentiful sunshine contrasts well, with the ever-darkening themes and actions of the narrative.

Finally, what also impressed me with Breaking Bad is the fact, (with the possible minor exception of Marie's kleptomania - not sure why it was ever introduced as a sub-thread anyway) there don't appear to be any loose ends left to annoy viewers. Everything that was started in the beginning and during the course of the 5 seasons, appears to have satisfying and believable outcomes. The most obvious and arguably important being, Walt's discovery of lung cancer early in Season 1, which leads to the poisoning of not just his body, but also his soul, both of which, it's not spoiling to suggest, end up being beyond salvation."
8.0,23 March 2021,
10.0,24 March 2021,"That is all, no words can describe this masterpiece"
8.0,8 August 2013,"This is such a tough review to write for this show. Much like your emotions as you watch this. Every character has something you root for and something you hate about them. I found myself cheering for Jesse much of the time, but he is a meth junkie and cook. Not the person you generally cheer for. I keep wanting to root for Walt in a weird way, but his evilness is taking him over.

I think the character development is what I really appreciate about this series. Each character has a background that makes the character human and someone you can relate to. I really enjoyed the character background of Gus. He is such an interesting character.

Another thing I really like about the show is each episode has parts that are very funny. Saul is the sleazy lawyer for many of the characters and I laugh each time he is on the screen. Walt's brother in-law (DEA agent) is a trip and just plain funny.

For anyone wishing to start watching here are some suggestions: 1) The concept of a chemistry teacher becoming a drug dealer after getting a cancer scare is a stretch in a way. But the story allows you to make it OK, you just have to keep an open mind. 2) You have to be OK with most of the main characters doing immoral stuff. You have to watch it as entertainment and stay curious how the story lines play out. 3) Put your seat belt on because there are twist throughout the seasons.

When I watch the show, I feel dirty afterwards and feel like it is real life, which means the show makes me feel like I am in each episode.

Overall, a unique show that has not been done before. If you like Lost and the Walking Dead, then you will most likely like this series."

10.0,13 March 2021,"There are so many shows with good ideas and original stories but they end kicking the bucket sooner or later because of the lack of material they've been given or that that the writer didn't think through that their stories would be a success. Not to blame them. But I honestly think whoever wrote Breaking Bad should be a novelist. Or a writer. This damn story is so good from the beginning to the ending. It got me hooked from the first episode and it just kept me hooked until the last season. Why? These characters are so deeply written that you would think they would exist in real life. Like really, did Walter White exist in real life? Maybe. It would be possible. This story was so realistic and interesting you would think that. I think it's the best tv show out there. Give it a try will ya?"

But I think fourth season is going out of track.....

but I am waiting for what would be the end as gus and walter are trying to terminate each other,also hank behind gus which would put walter in front of hanks gun.

10.0,25 December 2020,"I liked the film in general, but I was binge watching it And had to fast forward it during some boring scenes Such as breakfast scenes. Gotta note that I hated Skyler character very much And her sister, skipped almost every scene that included the two.

The main subject that got me hooked up, was to see how Walt becomes a drug Lord or emperor... Every subplot other than that bored me

The Ending was Badass"
10.0,11 April 2020,"This is the most thought out show I have ever watched. Every single character is 100% necessary; every character has so much depth and so many layers of personality. They left it at 5 seasons for a good reason, to give it's viewers short and sweet QUALITY entertainment."

I'm crazy about series, i watch every kind with no restrictions, but no other series let me so speechless. The amazing performances from the actors, the complexity and transformation of the characters, the realism of the plot, the perfectionist way that the story is conducted, all the construction and development, every single detail was extremely well ""architected"" by the director, Vince Gilligan. A mixture of drama, suspense, psychological thriller, with the right pinch of comedy and action who makes you tense from the beginning to the end. Every new season is better than the previous and the series finale closes the story in a epic way. No wonder that Breaking Bad won so many awards, 63 at total in these 5 seasons. No wonder too, that even before the series ends, it was already considered cult. I highly recommend. I'm already missing Walt, Jesse, Saul, Gus, Mike, Hank, Albuquerque, Blue Crystal and everything about this series... Breaking bad it's not just a series. It is a work of art. ""I am the one who knocks""."

Thank you for not staying to long. You never made crap just because you could make money by staying on the air for longer.

Thank you for starting out as a extremely good show and only get better as it went along.

This show was like reading great literature. The story was great, but so much was going on on different levels.

May be the greatest work of art ever on TV."
10.0,13 August 2021,"I'm new to the show so take this with a grain of salt but this show is great in every way possible. Every episode makes you wanna watch more and more after the first episode you are HOOKED.

I love this show and it doesn't get much better."

The show would not be at all the same with out it's amazing writer Vince Gilligan, and it's extremely talented actors/actresses especially Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, and Dean Norris. You just get sucked into the show and can't stop watching, the show just he's more and more action packed every single episode building up to the shocking final season.

Everything about the show is perfect, it's sad to see the show is over and to know there will never be anything else on television up to the extremely high standards of Breaking Bad."

10.0,16 October 2014,"All I heard for months was what a great series this show is and after watching pretty much the entire thing in the span of 3 weeks (I know, but it was winter break for my school and I love movies) I was not disappointed in the slightest. I rarely found anything wrong in the acting or script. Very minimal awkward moments.

The only thing I wish that didn't happen was that awkward lull in the middle of the series where it became kind of a ""same sh*t different episode"" although I have rarely found the series that can pull off not doing that.

Bryan Cranston has shown a side I always knew possible and I am just happy he found it. Him and Aaron Paul are phenomenal actors and I hope to see more of them thanks to this.

In short, it's definitely worth your time and if it wasn't for the fact that it's really long and I have things to do with my life I would sit down and watch it all over again. Watch it and love it and welcome to the club."

10.0,6 February 2012,"Breaking Bad puts a whole new perspective on any television series before it. This action/adventure goes places that other television shows wouldn't even dare to look. Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher, is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With a pregnant wife and son with cerebral palsy, he knows he needs to make some quick money to support them after he is gone. He quickly falls into the drug world with a former student of his, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), cooking and selling one of the most potent and dangerous drugs known to man, methamphetamine. While he is trying to make a more stable life for his family, he must watch as his own life spirals out of control."
10.0,3 February 2022,"+ Cinematography + Acting + Plots + Awesome comedy +Good characters motivation

10.0,24 May 2014,"Often at times the standard of writing and acting in TV series can be sub par, however from the the initial synopsis you can tell this was a thought provoking labor of love. And if this series was going to everything the writer and director hoped it would be, it would needed everyone to be on there game and Bryan Cranston was from start to finish. In my option Aaron Paul grew as an actor as did his character throughout the show and the relationship between the two of them really took you through all the emotions possible. I am sure you will have heard a lot about this series and it's never really advised to believe the hype and more take the journey and judge for yourself and enjoy."

10.0,26 November 2013,"The story line make me to want more and more. I want to see every small detail form this TV series because the producer was extremely careful to details if you watch when you are disconnected from your daily concerns you will see all the evidence left by the characters some times you see something that will be an important clue in the investigation that the camera does not focus on it but is in a light that make you to remember the thing till finely it come and make a change in the life of Walter and Skyler White, Jesse Pinkman and Hank and Marie Schrader and the other characters. I'm still viewing the TV Show and I hope that the end will be as original as before and will not be a cliché like the other movies and TV Shows I follow before.

I was a big Malcolm in the middle fan and was used to him being the stupid father. I was wrong. He did excellent in his role of Walter White. And the rest of the cast is perfect. It has deep characters that you get invested into, and moments that just make you go,"" did that just happen?"" It will always keep you guessing. This is why it is the best show ever. Aaron Paul was pretty much what you would imagine a drug dealing failure of a student to be. This show is also very realistic. You finish an episode, go outside and think to yourself,"" and this really happens?"" If you decide to watch this show. Say good bye to your social life."
10.0,18 December 2023,"Really good and quite gripping series, which despite not being quite as good in the later seasons as it was in the beginning, keeps the suspense going.

The cinematography is some of the greatest I've seen in a TV series. Kudos to Vince Gilligan and the team behind the making of Breaking Bad (2008 - 2013). The characters are top notch and perfectly acted. The main two create a very good chemistry and duo between them.

I'm a little disappointed in the love story, and on the fate of one of the characters.

Nevertheless, Season 1 and Season 2 are GIANTS! Super interesting. After that, the story starts to get a little fuzzy, followed by unrealistic events that annoy in a very small way, but don't challenge the greatness of this series.

Final Score: 8/10."

10.0,14 January 2019,Best show ever on tv and will be forever nothing can beat it for next century
10.0,12 August 2018,"I 'll make it short: if you can resist this, then you are one out of a billion. In other words: I had the tip from a friend and from the first episode on, I could not make myself to see only one episode. At least two per day and I remember seeing five (and that was before noon on a Sunday...). Yes, I know I am weird, but I'm not the only one."
10.0,3 March 2021,Can't remember much of it apart from it was awesome but the one thing that lets it down are the fluff and filler episodes sometimes it take an age to get to the end of a plot because the writers and directors have to make it to the minimum episode threshold.
10.0,2 June 2024,"There are plenty of people rating 10 this amazing 10/10 show. No wonder, at first it took me some time to watch the show but then i got completely hooked, BrBa just keeps getting better and better each season.

The script is just perfect, perfect down to the last minute detail, perfect story touching philosophical aspects sometimes and being unrealistically real and the show made me really think about life, Walter white became a ""bad"" man but what matters when you are dying and you don't feel proud of your life, i would do the same.

Bryan Cranston. He gave me one of the most raw and realistic interpretations i have ever seen, a master class in acting.

I don't lie when I say that I cried excited when i remembered I was watching the best TV show of all time."
10.0,12 April 2021,This serie is absolutely perfect and everything you watch afterwards will simply not compare in any way. The story line is breath-taking. It has all the elements you need and more for the best story line of all time. Character development is also second to none.
10.0,18 August 2011,"A story about a chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer and to support his family starts preparing the drug meth from which he hopes to earn enough money.

Breaking Bad has everything going for it whether its the direction or the acting or writing.This is one of the few shows which provides such a detailed character arc of all the leads. What this show does well is blend dark humor with suspense with (occasional)action with detailed character sketches.This show is all about the details, its amazing how well the script is thought out(many scenes resort to metaphors).The moral dilemmas which each character faces in many situations throughout the 4 seasons are quite intense.Many complain that this show is slow but its this slow pace which helps to build the tension.If we didn't care about the characters then why would we care about what happens next in their life and in order for us to care about the characters we need to understand them and their mindset and that is only possible if the show has a slow pace in which each actor has time to showcase their character. In season 1 walter white is this reserved chemistry teacher who loves his family and seems like a person who wont even hurt a fly but as the seasons progress he truly breaks bad and his evil side is let loose. The marvelous thing about the show is that the supporting cast is brilliant, they are not just random people who are penned down on the script just to accompany walter white in his story but they are well thought out characters who affect the whole story.

The acting in this show is the best you will ever see. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul are currently my 2 most favorite people in this world.They live the characters and give their characters life.Their are many tense moments in this show where the characters are in a difficult situations and they have to get out of them and these situations are really thrilling ,but what i find more thrilling is when the character has 2 choices to make and in most cases one choice is good and one choice is evil and the way the whole scenario and the moral dilemma is showcased really makes you just want to stand up and clap.

I truly recommend this show cause this show will absorb you into its METH world. This show might just be the best show you haven't seen!!!!!"
10.0,23 February 2022,This show was the absolute best. The characters were fully developed and died charm to the show. I loved following them through the seasons to see how they evolved.
10.0,10 March 2011,"I've been a huge fan of Breaking Bad since I first started seeing the ads for season 1. I've told everyone I know about how great this show is. I've gotten my wife and all of her friends hooked on it, and we religiously watch every episode.

Breaking Bad hooks the viewer immediately with it's lets get down to business approach. This show is a unique, candid portrayal of shocking realism. Each individual character in Breaking Bad is unforgettable, and as real as can be. No fluff. The unstable balance between Walt's criminal endeavors and his middle-class teacher profile is brilliant. The excitement over all of the characters coming within a millimeter of exposing Walt and the threat of the ball of yarn coming unraveled at any time is thrillingly unnerving.

I can't wait to see what season 4 brings, and how all of the pieces of the puzzle will come together. Breaking Bad has all the elements of a timeless drama. Well thought out, and well executed.

Buying the DVDs!"
10.0,2 September 2021,What to say about this series. Teaches the lesson of life.
10.0,25 June 2020,"Breaking Bad scores a perfect 10 in storyline, character building and performances. Actors are of ""Gold Standard"", no second thoughts. There are a few hiccups along the journey and episodes are slow paced in the first 3 seasons. Despite all these limitations, it qualifies for rating of 9 on 10. However, until the time a TV show better than Breaking Bad comes into prominence, this will deserve a perfect 10! Arguably, Breaking Bad is the best show ever and ""Ozymandias"" (S 05, Episode # 14) is ""the greatest 48 minutes ever in the history of world Television"". Breaking Bad has surely attained cult status and will continue to mesmerise audience for eternity."
10.0,3 April 2014,"The series Breaking BAd is excellent. When I saw the first episode I was immediately in love :) I finished seeing the first series I was blown away ... :) Now I've seen all the episodes I am absolutely sure that is the best series made throughout history ...! Surpasses all others with distinction ... Who likes a good argument and appreciates quality stuff, with all certainty that I will find it and give note 10 to this series. It is the BEST SERIES MADE UP TO TODAY!! I hope for more shows like this in the future :)

The series braking Bad will be remembered in the next 100 years. 100 years from now maybe this series will still continue to be in the Top 10 on this site :)

If not in the top 10 is better for us because it is a sign that in 100 years have made at least 10 excellent series like this"
9.0,26 August 2014,"Most of our Critics here possibly have been around 1 or 2 of these characters in real life.. for whatever reasons who knows.. I would think some of you have and then again maybe not. I have... and to say this story doesn't draw you in because of that fact of knowing some Meth. addicts would be lying!! If by chance you have known anybody or been around anybody that struggles with this terrible addiction then maybe you can relate to the series. If you haven't then you'll get a good lesson on the in's and out's of what this ""fictional in a lot of ways"" story is about. I think everybody evolved in creating this series should be given credit for creating a very believable character that being Walter White has been screwed around by a lot of so called friends and why should today be any different then the next for him who just cares about his Family... and they just care about getting by on a day to day basis... kinda like we all try to do if we can.... and we're all trying to survive life the best we can right? Well we try each and every day to deal with life's addictions... and for Walter White the only addiction he has is the love of his Family and keeping them happy and safe... so he thinks at least until his life takes an unexpected turn. So we live each day the best we can....it don't always work out that way for some reason though does it... especially for Walter White anyway. Sorry just ranting here... anyway.. Great directing!!... and for sure some of the best acting I've seen by all the cast members.. and when I say all... I mean all of the them regardless of their small roles or large. Simply a great job of television work on all the episodes and the phenomenal way of drawing you in at the end of each show is unprecedented. Thank you for all 5 seasons.... it was educational and very entertaining and has a place in my Family's lives right now... and some of the people we know and love!! Thank you Vince Gilligan and all the other people involved and I mean all of you.... you just may have possibly saved some lives from this terrible drug.. possibly... let's hope so... Hail the King!!"
10.0,17 June 2020,This is the best show ever! If you watch this show it will change you!
9.0,20 June 2014,"Breaking Bad is what I consider thee greatest show ever aired, while many would disagree they couldn't say it was anything less of incredible. The first scene, a man looking at what he's done scared and upset, to the last scene, with the grin and happiness he's long sought. While the show is very linear there are subplots they create and get rid of. The acting is 10/10 Emmy worthy, I love Malcolm in the Middle and all I can say is, wow. What a transformation. Cranston has always either captivated me or had me laughing in tears. Every character feels so necessary and needed to continue a great story. While Skylar can get annoying you can't help but feel for her. Walter Jr exaggerates his disease perfectly, and Jesse, ooh Jesse. This man sold me from the start that he would be amazing. Each character develops over time and I'd say he (a tad more than Walt) has the largest transformations. Before I watched Breaking Bad on Netflix I'd never seen any of these actors besides Cranston, and now I love all of em. Walt is a guy who you shouldn't root for but you do through the entire series, and when you don't believe me it's very short lived. Every action has a consequence, and the ""answer man"" as Mike says can either avoid them or fix them. From police to dealers to his partner. If you never seen this show and are hesitant to watch it. Sit down, get a drink and some popcorn, watch the entire first 7 episode season and see why this show is so highly praised."
9.0,10 March 2020,"Maybe best acting show ever ,,,,,, its impact on me more than big movies ''drama ,, mystery,, action,, crime,,comedy,, and horror sometimes,, its complicated to describe"
10.0,14 May 2014,Ik had the luck that when VPRO started Breaking Bad they aired a week long every evening at 23:00 hours a episode of the Season one. At the start I realised that I've never seen anything that was comparable. There was comedy there was suspense. There was a normal family with his ups and downs. There was a brother in law at the DEA who had a very good relationship with his brother in law who gets into crime. But what was most astonishing was the fact that i could remember every episode. All of that beautiful filmed with sometimes surprisingly camera-shots and angles. Normally I watch a series but after a while the details and storyline are out of memory. Not with Breaking Bad. Every episode will stuck in your mind. The best thing you can do is sit down watch Breaking Bad and it will come in your live. All good things must end and sadly now the final episode was shown 11/5/2014. I'm looking forward to buy the Barrel so I can watch it again in remembrance of the Best Show I've ever seen

10.0,31 January 2022,This show is an addictive one. One of the best series after game of thrones. These both are the best one till now. This series is fully took with reality. It has many nail biting sequences. Perfect crime thriller drama for all time. Did with perfect cast. Heisenberg acting was first class throughout the series. 100 cent recommended.

First season opening second season exciting, third season amazing, fourth season Fairy and fifth season GREAT, in this series you will live with the characters and delve into each of them. If I write a book in it to tell about it, I won't do it right. Ladies and gentlemen this show is the embodiment of drama as it should be!"
10.0,18 August 2021,"I would say it's ONE of the best shows if GOT hadn't made those last few episodes in the last season. I still love GOT, but no one has ever made an ending of a series as perfect as Breaking Bad. The build up from the first episode to the very last was so beautifully crafted. The acting, the writing, the editing, the music, it was all together a masterpiece. Will there ever be a show as good as this? I would say no, unless there is, and we don't even know it's happening until it's half way through. Just like Breaking Bad."
10.0,2 March 2023,"Breaking Bad isn't just the best TV drama of all time. It's the best TV series of all time, regardless of genre.

I've seen every episode at least twice and there isn't a weak one among the bunch. Even the filler episodes like ""Fly"" are brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed... there simply isn't a false move throughout the entire run.

Vince Gilligan and company were ingenious in their decision to plan everything out before they started making the show because every development feels so organic and everything works on multiple levels. There are tons of surprises but nothing ever feels contrived.

I simply can't praise this series enough. It's a masterpiece."

10.0,30 November 2013,"i am a high school student who was taking honors chemistry when someone told me about this show on netflix. the first weekend i sat down to watch an episode i ended up watching the entire first season. this show is something completely different. the plot is so elaborate and well thought out, it feels like an endless movie more than a TV show. the way vince gilligan was able to create a show that contained every time of emotion you can feel is truly amazing. i became a huge fan of this show and after watching the first episode i was hooked until the end. brian cranston does am amazing job as walter white and is able to depict this moral transformation that white goes through in a way i have never seen before on a television screen. this show has set the bar for future televion. honestly no other show is even close. breaking bad is without a doubt a 10, and even though amc's other show ""the walking dead"" is great, its a 6 compared to gilligans masterpiece. I've never seen a show so perfectly executed. i made an IMDb account just so i could review the best thing television has ever seen."

9.0,9 May 2015,"This show is absolutely amazing. Everything about it: the acting, the characters, the writing, the plot...it's all there! This show doesn't fall short at any moment and keeps the audience always wondering. I love it! It is not action packed in the explosive and life and death type way 24/7. No, this show takes time to develop everything. Everything has a reason, and they actually make sense. It is still action packed, but in a different way.

The acting is on point in almost every scene. They bring the characters to life, and they portray the characters how the writers probably want them to be portrayed. I loved every character, even if I disapproved of their actions. Moreover, I sympathized with them, got mad at them, was screaming (inside my head) at them.

This show is an art. I don't know if I could express how much of a treasure it is. I read somewhere that someone said something along the lines of : ""I am envious of the people who haven't watched this show because they have the opportunity to watch this brand new."" That statement is gold. Could not be more true. This show is life, and definitely my favorite show."
10.0,27 January 2022,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism."

I wanna thank all the people involved in the making of this series that made the greatest series of all time. Now, I watch all the other series and think to myself that: this series won't be as good as Breaking Bad. YEA"
10.0,4 October 2015,"Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul is made legend series I can certainly recommend.

When I reviewed the first series, I asked: What is Walt up to? Is this some desperate, incoherent scream of rage in the face of the approaching blackness? In the end, we do learn the rather simpler answer because, well, Walt tells us. And it really does make sense of everything. Almost. Breaking Bad is great. But it's not perfect. Cranston's performance alone is enough to keep me watching for a while, but I'd like to see something resembling a completed formula, and soon.

This show is just amazing,I loved every episode,This is one of my favorite shows......

But....It's not for everyone ,This show is not safe for people under the age of 15....

But it is enjoyable for pretty much everyone else :D"

Breaking Bad == Superb plot + Outstanding acting by Bryan Cranston + Kickass story line + Bone-chilling moments + Unexpected twists and turns + Love + Emotions + Psychic behavior of Cranston + Comedy.

Since the day I watched First episode, Cranston has occupied special place in me because of his mesmerizing acting, I'm astonished that how a person can be so involved with his role like this.Aaron Paul's acting is really cool and you'll see the complete involvement with his role.

This TV show itself is like a drug.I was and I am highly addicted to this TV show.I feel to watch it again and again.It's impossible to take Bryan Cranston out of your mind."

I started watching on Netflix about a week and half ago, and I've just finished all 5 seasons today. Yep, I've lost my job because of all the sickies I've been pulling since watching ;) It's like a good book you can't put down, you get so involved with the story and characters and you can't bear to put it down. The writing is superb and all the actors were brilliant. Cranston and Paul are two of the greatest actors I've ever seen, and their performances were worthy of every award nomination and win that they received. Same goes for the show in general. I haven't seen anything like it and I doubt I ever will again.

Honestly, do yourself a favor - watch this show. You'll be seeing something truly spectacular."

But I more than recommend it, you have to watch this show before you die. Its so good, that you can't spoil it--you have to see it to believe it. The acting is so good, that its super believable--everyone puts 100% love and effort into making each second of it. But its not just the acting and effort. It is even artistic in every way, and haven't seen as much art in any movie or TV show in my life, since the art in this is beautiful and unbelievable; touched up with the perfect songs for each scene."

10.0,11 June 2014,"I must start by saying that Breaking Bad is the best show on TV i ever watched.

I heard about this since it started it's 2nd season, everywhere wonderful review, really good critics, and high IMDb rating, but i just let it slip since i didn't think this is that good.

But a few weeks back when i heard that Breaking Bad ended it was every where and that is when i decided to give it a go, so i bought it and it blew (especially after i watched the first season).

Today i completed watching it and I'm really happy that i did and sad that it drew me inside and like every time you watch something you think what next, what now after this.

Now, i think AMC is the network for mind blowing shows Madmen, Low Winter Sun, The Walking Dead... and the greatest of all Breaking Bad.

This show has everything packed in, everything you look for in a good show, Very good cast (characters), writing, directing, story, layer upon layer carefully placed, nicely developed... just great.

Keep up the good work and bring us the good shows AMC."

9.0,7 November 2010,"**minor spoilers**

Breaking Bad is simply put one of the very best TV series in the history of television. The plot sounds very simple and in some ways generic at first glance. A law abiding chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer and decides to use the time he has left to leave behind some money for his family by producing crystal meth.

This series runs with that idea and never slows down. Everything here is top notch. The Acting on this show has won multiple Emmys (Lead and Supporting in a Drama Series), the writing keeps everything fresh and fluid, the cinematography is movie caliber, the direction and editing are also spot on.

However, accolades and awards are what this show wins but not what is it about. This show is about telling a story that is in every way fully developed and deliberate with its steady pace.

Walter White is a man who as the series starts; appears to be your typical nerdy science teacher. When pushed to desperation we see him take the road less traveled by and step outside society's rules. We see him go into a dangerous world and go deeper still after seeing its harsh reality. We see this is a man who has some demons of his own. Who, for reasons revealed as the story unfolds, feels like he is not where he should be in life. He played by the rules and feels cheated and now he plans to get what is owed him.

He teams up with Jesse Pinkman. A small time dealer and user who at first teachers Walter the ropes. We see their ambitions rise ever higher and their relationship become wonderfully complex and intricate.

Skylar is Walter's wife who we see go on a roller coaster of emotions as events unfold. From loving wife who is scared for her husband to suspicious wife who starts to notice something is not quite right and more.

Hank is Walter's DEA brother in law who comes off as buffoonish and simple at first but soon we see his many layers underneath the initial glance.

Many other great characters as added as the story goes on and all of them get their time to shine as we get to know them.

What they all have in common is all of them are affected by the choices Walter makes and we see again and again how things slowly get a little worse because of them. This is a story of going into a toxic world and having it contaminate you and the people around you. About how good intentions can lead to bad results. About how a bad environment can bring out those latent emotions of rage, greed and ruthlessness. Most of all though, perhaps it is about asking a simple question.

How long can you stay in that world before it starts to become a part of you? And how long before there is no way out?

Walter White made his decision and started breaking bad; but is there still a chance he will change his mind and start breaking good?

This emotional, tense, funny and often unpredictable ride will keep you glued to your seat waiting for that answer."
10.0,9 March 2020,I can't believe I waited this long to watch this show. I wish I could watch it for the first time over and over again.
10.0,9 February 2011,"I am a new member here. My summary says it all. Every facet of this series is top-notch. I know that meth is evil. Yet I'm rooting for Walt and Jessie to get away with it all and come out on top. Unlikely. I pray there is at least 5 worthwhile seasons. This is must-watch TV. But some may want to suspend some of their moral predispositions - at least for an hour/week. I have seen every episode twice. And some three times. Every viewing I have enjoyed more then the last. This entire cast is, well, magic. The highlight of the show for me is the intense interaction between Walt and Sky. There have been scenes over the three seasons that have been as riveting as anything in my favorite films. Breaking Bad, like (for me Six Feet Under) is a showcase of what television can be. Unlike Six Feet Under it has yet to slide, even briefly, into mediocrity."
10.0,22 September 2020,No matter what you are or who you are. Watch this show before its too late. I it's incredible and worth every second of your time. You will be sorry if you make yourself not watch it. Please watch this piece of art.

10.0,23 June 2020,"Yes, you heard it right. It will start slow amd then increase pace in exponential rate with peak of its curve ending in the finale episode."
10.0,9 April 2014,
10.0,8 August 2023,"This is the best series/show out there I highly suggest you guys to watch it I have watch it like 5 times it's the best series out there nothing like it, I would give my right arm to erase my memory so I can watch it again without knowing what will happen, just listen to me and go fking watch it u won't regret it I falled in love with it first.time I watch it Breaking Bad, Prisonbrake, GOT, TWD, Banshee, Sons Of Anarky, Vikings, Warrior, is my favorites but breaking Bad beats them all easy you won't get disappointed trust me it's not slow it's fast every episode is great so guys go and watch it rt."
9.0,29 March 2024,"First of all, the series is one of the best ever, if not the best. Everything great you've heard about it is true in my eyes. The staging, the production design, bloody hell the characters and so on is terrific. Namely Walter White is one of the best written characters in the history of the series because he is so multifaceted and still understandable, even though it involves such abstruse decisions. Plus The excellent acting of Bryan Cranston it's simply an outstanding character. But the other actors are also great and try their best to build on that, led by Giancarlo Esposito. The praise doesn't stop there because the plot is just as brilliant. Each episode carries the story forward but also has its own circular conclusion, making it self-contained. The only thing I have to advise is to keep watching, because you may not find the first seasons as gripping as you hear everywhere. It was the same for me, but from season 3 onwards, the series will not let you go. I have nothing but appreciation and praise in my heart for the creator (Vince Gilligan). What he's created is absolutely brilliant art!"
10.0,26 September 2019,"The best tv series ever produced and no one (I mean literally no one) come close to this masterfully written series. There was a hope for GOT but they sucked so badly. 10/10 Mr. White, your legacy will remain forever! 😌💙 PS- Don't get me wrong but Felina could've been much better (it was still a great ending no doubt but as the last scene occurred their was a lil dissatisfaction I felt. Just my opinion though, peace!)"
9.0,1 July 2020,And ha the ending was cinematically best.got deserves that too
9.0,20 May 2022,Seen it 4 times and I'm sure I'll watch it plenty more over the years. Named my cat after Jesse. Can't imagine anything will ever quite live up to the greatness of BB.
10.0,16 May 2020,"After watching this play, I have two thoughts: Firstly, don't annoy people with knowledge. Secondly, the most common life details that have been ignored are the ones that make people nostalgic for life. For example, the sound of the vacuum cleaner and the smell of the wife's cream."
10.0,13 March 2017,"First of all I should say that ""only"" 10 rating is not enough for this show,just due to Breaking Bad IMDb should increase max. rating to more than 10 because I have rated many things 10 before but believe me those things were no where close to Breaking Bad.So either I have to change those ratings to less than 10 or IMDb should increase max. rating and I am sure many people think the same. Now about the show I will say that it is the most reasonable show I have ever seen Every event has a reason of why its happening and how its happening.Its like watching a real life happening.This is the most important reason why I like this show the most. The actors are wonderful,outstanding,superb and mind blowing.Everyone has done their role with excellence.But most beautiful actors are both the lead Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.Its so pleasing and interesting to watch the duo on screen.Their chemistry is out of this world,each second they act together on screen its like gem. There is lot to say about the show and I can ramble on paragraphs and paragraphs but keeping it to this much only I would like to add this that if you haven't watched any show in your lifetime and you know you are going to be dead in some days and also you want your last days to be amazing than this must be the show you should watch."
10.0,27 June 2020,"An absolutely fantastic TV show having you root for characters who are fighting completely against each other. Not a single bad season, at points were slow episodes yet inevitably had a satisfying end result."
9.0,24 February 2019,"Well, I've finally finished watching the entire Breaking Bad. I can honestly say it's quite probably the most consistently excellent TV show I've ever seen, with the arguable exception of The Wire. Damn, but it's hard to call which is better, so I'm not going to. Most shows which have longevity really struggle to bring things to a close when their number is finally up, but the way Walter White ends his meth-cooking saga, on his own terms, is nothing short of genius. There's really not much that could've been done to make Breaking Bad better, even with hindsight. The lead performances of Walt and Jesse are superb, and the majority of the supporting cast do solid work with sometimes slim material. If I was being uber critical I might suggest some of the lesser characters don't serve much purpose, but then again they're part of the wallpaper of life, as it were; no one lives in a vacuum, especially not meth-cooking master criminals. The dialogue is frequently fantastic, but not generally out of character, and the storyboarding is more than occasionally astoundingly good. Notable scenes are the mariachi tale of how much the Mexican cartels had come to hate Heisenberg, and the flashy intro to Walt's compulsive purchase of twin musclecars for him and his son. These flashes of humour throughout the series really lift the dramatic content too. If you've never watched BB, but have ever wondered what all the fuss was about (like I did for 10 years), just buy the boxset and start binging. I defy you to be disappointed."
10.0,16 February 2021,"What can I say that hasn't already been said!? Having read all the other reviews there is nothing to add here. I would agree 'don't watch this show' for two reasons. Firstly it is a binge watch and it will take up all your time when you might have other important things to do - you just can't help it!! Secondly, after you have seen this anything else just pales by comparison. This one saw me through lockdown till 3am on many occasions on the edge of my seat. It was recommended to me by a friend and I must admit that at first the subject matter didn't appeal to me. Nevertheless, I gave it a go and I cannot praise it highly enough. The acting is superb from all of the cast. Also, the cinematography and music is brilliant. It is a film where style is combined with substance which is rare. Pure genius in every way!!"
10.0,8 January 2021,It's very nice series....i love it.say my name hiscenburg character and jeesipinkman nailed it
10.0,21 April 2020,This show tells underground life of South USA perfectly. You have to watch that.
9.0,19 June 2020,The plot keeps you trapped from the get-go with an incredible narco story
10.0,3 September 2020,"Solid acting, people getting into their characters. The story is good, original and the (mostly) greatest plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it is just the first episode. Nothing bad to say about it. Solid thumbs up for me."
10.0,13 March 2022,
8.0,26 December 2014,"Do yourself a favor and watch arguably one of the best, highest rated, most award nominated/award winning shows ever. I probably don't need to tell you about the plot, because most people know what it is, but in case you don't know, Walter White, a high school Chemistry teacher, and Jessie, his old high school student, meet up and work together with Walters knowledge of Chemistry, and Jessies' street knowledge, they build a meth empire. Each season has its own story arch, revolving around a different character or idea, and each season is more intense than the last. This show also has some of the best acting I've ever seen. And all of it is on Netflix. You know what to do."
10.0,16 July 2014,"You gotta take your laptop with your booming headphones and sit down for hours cuz all that what happens in there won't let you move your head even an inch. A perfect blend of picturization,story,thrill all together with a set of excellent characters bringing out ""THE BEST"" compilation of crime drama ever seen!! The best part is the sequence of the story, you can never predict what's next and its always the beginning of the episode giving the thrill. You can't skip this series if you are a thriller freak. Excellent work!! Hope it would have continued forever!! Hats off for Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul for their work and to all crew members!!"
10.0,4 April 2014,"It's more then excellent, it's a master piece. I never heard about this series until a few weeks ago, here in EU you don't get the change to see them all. If you are here it is because you heard about it and probably currently watching it or heard someone talking about these series. The only think i can tell, go tell other people about this series, as you now you will understand it's unbeatable insane good written 5 seasons catching drama. The story, the character development, the setting, music, locations, reality, it has so many elements in to it, that no episode is boring and everything just sums how it should and what you just never have seen before."
10.0,13 April 2014,"wow!what a great series. 1 shouldn't missed this show. Bryan Cranston@Mr.Heisenberg...You are such a great actor. Just loved this show. Totally worth watching. Cant believed its over. All those thrills,the excitement...wow...just wow......the actors are great too. Vince Gilligan thanks for such a wonderful series. AMC thanks for presenting yet a wonderful show like this beside ""The Walking Dead"". Hoping for many more wonderful shows from amc and Vince of course... it was great waiting for the show while it was running. The storyline's just perfect. A perfect pack.Aaron Paul also did a great job.All the crewz are awesome."

10.0,19 March 2014,"The writing never falters throughout the course of the five seasons.the show goes on we realize that there's a lot more to his character than just a clever chemist trying to leave a legacy. First you will like this guy Walter White, then you will pity him, then you start feeling good for him when he starts becoming a bad-ass, then you will despise him for he goes too far too brutal in his actions.It's a fantastic concept and watching a character develop and change. AS WALTER SAID-CHEMISTRY IS A STUDY OF MATTER....AND WHAT HE PREFER TO SEE IT AS A CHANGE...THIS WHOLE LINE EXPLAINS EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF HIS LIFE.... AND I FLATTER WHAT VINCE SHOWS US THE REALITY NOT A FANTASY WORLD....

Its not just a TV show Breaking Bad is an experience."
8.0,9 July 2021,"Ever since the first episode I have loved and been addicted to Breaking Bad, the characters, writing, acting, cinematography and storytelling are purely unbeatable. This is further reinforced with the second part of the fifth season, which never stops surprising and shocking you. It is THE masterpiece, nothing tops it."
10.0,9 July 2021,There is nothing you can watch better than this and there will be nothing you will watch better than this! Infinite out of 10.
10.0,13 February 2022,In the process of watching it for the 3rd time. Just keeps getting better... easily one of the top three TV shows of all time.. could have had a happier ending.. Walter White.
10.0,16 November 2013,
9.0,15 July 2021,So Gus Fring was in the first space jam and needed to be in the second one but he couldn't so why did they not cast Asaante Wright a literal lookalike to play him? Can't even watch the movie...
10.0,1 July 2020,The show can be regarded as the greatest only for the way they ended the series. There's no show even close to the way this show was ended
10.0,25 October 2010,"After the consistent awards this series has gotten, I caved in and decided to catch up on the craze, and I am everything but disappointed.

The story is about a high school chemistry teacher's introduction into the darker side of life, drugs. His wife is pregnant, his friends are successful, his son has cerebral palsy, and a couple other significant factors that cause his break-down from everything he once knew.

Bryan Cranston (Malcolm in the Middle), Aaron Paul, and RJ Mitte are my three favorite actors in this series. Bryan Cranston has won numerous awards for his portrayal of Walter White. Aaron Paul is one of the first actors I've seen that pulls off the ""thug"" style without being over-the-top or embarrassing. RJ Mitte portrays a kid with cerebral palsy extremely well, I hope he gets enough recognition. Anna Gunn and Dean Norris are both extremely talented in the series as well.

The series seems as if it has a limited storyline, but every episode leads to more potential, and it is bound to be a classic. The opening to the episodes are sometimes set in the future, which is creative and refreshing from the normal openings.

I cannot praise this series enough, let's just hope it continues to be successful. It's worth the time and money, perfectly perfect."
10.0,12 March 2020,"This one is so exciting and fun. 2 man making drug by chemicals way and going hard way with some dangerous man, that story is so good , so impressive and so addicting"
10.0,2 April 2017,"The series about Walter White, who is a chemist, and he has been diagnosed with cancer. So he turns he's life upside-down and starts to make methanol with his old student Jesse Pinkman. And why, you may ask, is Walter doing this, to his wife Skyler, his boy Walter Jr. and to his daughter, who hasn't born yet.

Vince Gilligan, the creator off this series, had a simple plot and made it a unique one. Uniqueness in the series is in the characters. Bryan Cranston is a wonderful Walter White. The way he made the character in to his own, is still a mystery. We see Walters light side on all of the episodes, but when he is dark, he really is dark. The dark side is what you wait to see from a teacher and Bryan is great at it.

Aaron Paul is great as Jesse Pinkman. Aaron character is wise, alone and very powerful. Aaron has a way off making the character live to his expectations. Jesse is a very alone guy, who is only trying to stay alive and make it in life, but there a obstacles on the road.

Dave Porter, who has made the music, is great on this series. The cinematographers had a great way to make the viewer see what they needed to see. And the series director are all one of a kind on Breaking Bad.

I think that in the past ten years or so, the TV-series has become, and still are becoming, even better than movies. In movies you have to be excited only for a couple off hours. In a series, like this one, you get to be excited, anxious and even tense for a whole year. You have to wait for a whole week to see the next episode and wait for a whole year that the show will continue.

This series is definitely one of a kind."
10.0,14 February 2018,
10.0,14 June 2021,"It seems like they are: they spend all of their time together and Louis is always giving Walt Jr. A ""ride"". Not explicitly stated but appears obvious if you look carefully."
8.0,3 July 2021,
10.0,15 February 2014,
9.0,16 June 2019,"It was very boring at the begining but started to get me in the details, curious about whats gonna happen next. Last series is amazing but the end was not expected"
10.0,5 April 2014,The character development of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman is just amazing the love and hate relationship between the two could be a show in of its self (altgough I cant see spinoffs being good for the Breaking Bad series). The high school chemistry teacher going on a DEA ride along meets his ex student who is making Meth and decides to join in on the operation. The two acquire an RV to cook with Walts chemistry supplies. Walt is in it for famliy because of his lung cancer Jesse is well Jesse. Walt and Jesse shares some famously amusing quotes that if you don't know you need to! One complaint about the show is there are only 5 seasons that I have enjoyed a lot but tgen again its better to go out with a bang then sputring downward spiral of viewership like some hit shows such as the Office over stayed there time. All the characters come in to the show and make it worth watching and never disapoints. Better Call Saul is a spin off and is coming November im a little scared sure a reunion would be nice but Saul for a whole new TV show I don't know.
10.0,24 March 2014,"My rating: 9001/10. Over 9000! I used to think that Game Of Thrones, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Trek: The Next Generation were the three best TV shows ever made, but Breaking Bad is on a whole other level, the level of genius is out of this world. It's the only TV show I've seen that cannot be rated simply a 10. Giving it a 10/10 only gives it an ""excellent"" rating, it's much more than that, it's a masterpiece among masterpieces. I've seen hardcore fans of: Star Trek, Game Of Thrones, Star Wars, Walking Dead admit that Breaking Bad is much, much better, so much better it cannot even be compared. The skills of the camera team are the best I have ever seen. The actors are the best I have ever seen. The music is the best ever. The story will stay with me for the rest of my life. The script is mind boggling. Breaking bad is so powerful that it will change the way I live my life forever.

I also used to think that the actor Bryan Cranston, the main actor in Breaking Bad was a terrible actor. I could not have been more wrong. The only reason why Bryan Cranston was terrible is because the TV show Malcolm in the Middle destroyed his reputation in my eyes.

The show also even contains hidden subliminal messages, flashes of information on the screen, quick references to libertarian politics and was most probably written by a libertarian who follows the Austrian School of economic thought. I could clearly sens the social and economic awareness of the author throughout the show, pure genius. There were also references to former congressman Ron Paul, my all time favorite politician."
9.0,7 April 2014,"i give a 9 not a 10 simply because we need to hold our breaths for most part of the show..the lighter moments do not contain much wit and humor.The show pretty much reflects reality in terms of Walter's cancer,so you cannot experience immense joy or laughter watching that family..and his wife is also the type of person who's concerned with every little details of her husband's life and very curious when she feels the husband's hiding something..the plot is great,the storyline is great..but,you won't laugh or even smile much during the show even when it's a little bit slow..so prepare to acknowledge the reality what any serious sickness can do to you..."
10.0,12 July 2021,"It's one of my favorite tv series, if you haven't watch it yet, please do that. It will never waste your valuable time."
10.0,20 October 2014,"The only star lacking in my rating is due to the slow parts in the White family & household scenes. I found myself thinking "" get on with it!"", then I started to just fast-forward thru that. Otherwise, just great writing. Usually I find something implausible but Mr Gilligan did a great job. The X-files never really caught my attention but now I'll have to start watching that show. Great casting as well. At first, I couldn't stop thinking about Bryan Cranston as the goofy dad in ""Malcom in the middle"" or as the converted dentist in Sienfeld but before I realized it Cranston was & always be Mr White... until the next great role he plays."
10.0,12 May 2014,"A true phenomenon. Just finished watching this masterpiece. I think it deserves every accolade going including an Oscar. Hard to describe how one feels after the last and final episode finished. The writing, the acting, the directing, the skill, the list goes on.. how on earth can anyone top this I don't know!!!! LOVED IT LOVED IT LOVED IT!!!!

The baddies were really bad. The actors top class each and everyone of them even the Baby acted on cue! The series took you on a roller coaster journey. Just as you thought you had it figured out it smacked you with something else.

Where do we go from here? I would have liked to have known what happens to the characters afterwards. Just a few loose ends."
10.0,23 December 2014,"This show is easily the best show I have ever watched. The story is excellent and is executed to near perfection. From a plot standpoint, it does a brilliant job of having an intriguing overarching plot through all the seasons, while having several mini-plots that get resolved as time goes on each season. It's very easy for a show like this to lose grip with reality, but it does a very good job of not falling off the unrealistic cliff. The characters are played exactly as the story would want them to be. Each character develops throughout the show with some of them creating internal conflict within yourself as to whether they're someone to root for or against. It has enough action to keep you on the edge throughout the show. I also appreciate that the network and writers didn't see its success and try to drag the show on and on. Without providing spoilers, I was very happy with the ending, which can't be said for many shows."
10.0,7 July 2017,"Breaking Bad, in addition to being one of the best shows ever, is also one of the easiest to love. Never before have I seen a show that seems to have everything you could want. It has the fiery explosions, the gruesome death, and the quotable lines of ""Game of Thrones."" It has the brilliant dark humor of ""The Sopranos."" It has the quiet character study of ""Six Feet Under."" It's recommendable to pretty much anyone, whether you're the type who wants awesomeness and explosions, hilarious dark comedy, or (and this one is me) quiet, brilliant character drama.

How it managed to combine all that is beyond me. If you're able to look past the fact that it's built on what seems like an unrealistic premise (but is actually very realistic once you get to know Walt's backstory), and will often sacrifice hyper-realism for better drama (unlike ""The Wire,"" which sacrifices better drama for hyper-realism), and the fact that, it can, at times, seem a tad stifled in its writing, you'll find what is, without doubt, one of the great shows to ever hit television.

It should be said now, and forever, that ""Breaking Bad"" is the best- acted show on television. I truly hope people aren't still arguing about that. You can point to any regular member of the cast, and find at least three episodes for which they deserved an Emmy. For certain members, like Cranston, Gunn, and Paul, you can point to pretty much ANY episode and see an Emmy-worthy performance. That can't be said for any other show. Cranston, in particular, gives what is hands-down the greatest performance in television history, and in ""Crawl Space,"" possibly gives the best performance in the HISTORY OF ACTING. Think I'm exaggerating? Get to season 4, episode 11, and you'll understand that I'm not exaggerating at all.

Then, there is another trademark of superiority for this show, something that can rarely be said, and that is the brilliance of the directors of this show. Whether it's ""Pilot,"" directed by Vince Gilligan, subtle but near perfect, or ""One Minute,"" directed by Michelle MacLaren, the best directing television's seen since the first episode of ""Lost,"" or ""Hermanos,"" ""Crawl Space,"" or ""Ozymandias,"" all giving subtle-but-brilliant moments in directing, or the brilliant ""Felina,"" which (and to this day, I'm impressed by this) makes Walt seems about a foot shorter than he actually is, because of the framing, which, given the context, couldn't be more appropriate.

Then, there's the music selection, which may seem unimportant, but is quite great. Whether it's the original soundtrack, masterfully constructed, heart-pounding, or heartbreaking, or the songs they choose, such as ""Crystal Blue Persuasion,"" ""The Hole,"" ""Baby Blue,"" and fifteen others, all of which are positively perfect for each situation.

And the writing, though I criticized it earlier, rightfully, at other times can be some of the best in television. ""Gray Matter"" sees Walt's fantastic pillow speech, ""Grilled"" Tuco's insanity, ""4 Days Out"" the humor the show is capable of while remaining dramatic still, ""Ozymandias"" the art of the downfall, ""Felina"" the perfect conclusion, ""Crawl Space"" the cruelty of Gus Fring, and (UNPOPULAR OPINION), ""Fly,"" one of the best episodes, because of the humor, and it proves itself to be, on multiple viewings, one of the funniest episodes of television ever.

And then, there's the fact that it produced ""Ozymandias,"" which is, as far as I can tell, the inarguable pick for the greatest episode of television ever created.

But perhaps the show's greatest accomplishment is the fact that it takes the trajectory most shows take and flips it. The vast, vast majority of shows start out great, and get worse and worse, until the finale, which is once again great. ""Breaking Bad"" flips it exactly. The pilot is great, and the show starts out worse than the pilot, and then gets better and better and better, ending in the legendary final season, without hesitation the greatest final season of television ever.

It also has the second-best series finale I've ever seen (seconded by ""Everyone's Waiting"" from Six Feet Under), brilliant tying up loose ends.

I struggle to find the words that can accurately convey the brilliance of this show, so I'll simply tell you to watch it, and know that I've never known anyone who disliked this show."
8.0,20 August 2020,"BB can get a little boring every now and then. But the story, character development, twists and turns make up for those. The acting is not of the usual TV show grade. The actors really nailed all of the characters. The best thing is BB managed to keep the quality all the way through. I can't say there were bad seasons or the series went downhill. That's what I love the most about BB. That's why Breaking Bad is better than GOT. Team BB never messed up."
8.0,3 April 2022,This show had great impact on me. The whole concept of going from an under-confident man who knows he deserves better and is a laughing stock for his peers to transforming into someone that is respected by himself and the people around is something a large population must relate to.
8.0,18 May 2015,"The thing, the 'only' thing, I didn't like about AMC's TV series was that you had to watch them in succession; and, at the time ""The Sopranos"" and ""Breaking Bad"" came out, I didn't have On Demand, so, I missed a few episodes.

Anyhow, after watching various episodes of both shows, I knew that they were great, so...I bought the DVD series when they were available and watched them in order.

This is an impeccable show with great characters and crew, and, some, not so great as with any show (villains and pain-in-the-butt characters); but, overall, I dare anyone to top this show.

Can anyone believe that the creator/writer/director of this show wrote the script for the movie ""Hancock;"" and, later, ""Better Call Saul!?!?"" Vince Gilligan is very much like Quentin Tarantino - a 'do-it-all-yourself' kinda guy.

Did anyone ever notice that the actor of Walter White was in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle"" (very versatile actor); the actor of Mike Ehrmantraut was in ""Beverly Hills Cop;"" the actor of Hank Schrader was in ""The Negotiator;"" and, the actor of Gustavo 'Gus' Fring was in ""Trading Places?"" I love figuring out 'who is who' in movies and TV shows, and, this is a 'who's who' of great actors!

This is an incredible TV series...and, if you like directors such as Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, Clint Eastwood, Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and, Guy Ritchie...and, the minds of Alfred Hitchcock, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and, Rod Serling - you'll certainly like this TV series...guaranteed! :)

This series could'a and should'a went on much, much longer!"
9.0,30 October 2020,Undoubtedly the best series in history. It will not come like that.
8.0,18 November 2020,This is hands down the best show ever that I've ever seen. And I've seen a looooooot of shows. The last time I watched it was years ago and I plan on bringing it again sometime soon just to relive it all over again.

10.0,25 March 2022,The best TVseries I have ever watched. I recommend this to every new friend I get. The best part of the series is watching Walter evolve into Heisenberg.

10.0,18 November 2020,"This is the best series I ever seen in my entire life. The evolution of the characters is amazing and the composition of the scripts and scenes are simply extraordinary. Thanks to Vice Gilligan, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and everyone of the cast for make the best series of the entire history."
10.0,12 February 2021,"There are amazing shows, then there are unbelievable shows and then there is Breaking Bad. Virtually faultless, all 5 seasons of the show are absolutely stunning achievements in acting, writing and filmmaking in general.

I have never seen anything like Breaking Bad and I don't believe I will again. The plot is clever and unmissable. As the seasons go on, it gradually becomes more and more addictive to the point of insanity.

This is the only 10/10 I have ever given and I totally stand by it. There is truly nothing out there quite like Breaking Bad."
10.0,27 June 2020,"This show ranks up there with The Wire and (almost) with The Sopranos. I love watching them make meth and make money. This is really a creative and interesting show.....but (i have to say this) sometimes the characters seem to change .... their character. For example, one minute Skyer is ghastly offended by her husband's new career and then she is fascinated with the money then she is horrified with his deeds and then she uses the money to buy a business to hide the money. I was always wondering which Skyler would show up. And Jesse would sometimes be a tough-talking tough guy not afraid to put a moon roof in someone's skull and then next episode is a crying mess. I did really like how Walter slowly transitioned from a meek science teacher to, at the end, a feral monster - very entertaining. Really a wonderful show. Thank you Vince Gilligan"
10.0,19 November 2020,"Great acting, Great story, Great makeup, great everything"
10.0,2 July 2020,"The episodes are not fast paced, the story build up is slow but it is superbly crafted. if u are looking for a good story with excellent performances ...breaking bad won't disappoint. All you need is patience while watching as the story unravels ."
10.0,2 May 2022,"I didn't think it was possible to hate Skyler even more. And Walt, what a terrible person from beginning to end. Only good people here are Hank and Jesse. Poor guys. Have been noticing too, I think Hank started to suspect Walt earlier on, but refused to believe it. You can see in how he looks at Walt when Walt talks about the chemistry or the case. Only when he saw Gale's inscription did he know for certain, and had to start believing his suspicions were real. Great show."

10.0,5 February 2011,"Breaking Bad, on the surface, seems to be a marketable and typical show following the usual premise of a middle class American leading a double life- one for good, and one for evil- in the wake of other great shows like the Sopranos, Dexter, Weeds, etc.

However, what starts off as an enjoyable drama evolves into a beautifully crafted tale- the stuff of a complex modern Shakespearian tragedy. Breaking Bad is more than just a television show. It is a work of art. The acting is mostly impeccable, and the writing and dialogue is original and profound. On top of it all, the directing style seems to have evolved and improved throughout the series. Nearly every shot is a masterpiece of its own.

So if you are looking for an original series, which will not only kill a couple of hours, but also leave you seeing the world in a different way- finding story in every small instance around you- this is the show for you"
8.0,14 March 2022,"It is a fantastic show with fantastic cast. It is better than Game of Thrones, Money Heist and Peaky Blinders. I think everyone must watch this. The main characters are described as losers or narcodealers but the evolution of their lives to a new level, happy or sad episodes from their life make the whole thing more interesting. It is teaching you about human psychology too. So turn on the TV and get to watch."
9.0,12 May 2014,
10.0,27 June 2020,"Its a perfect show with great cinmetography and it has that thing which binds you with it. The very basic thing is that it has simple story with no some additional fictions or anything but the way they portrayed the series, it was just wow. Acting, dialogues,writing,direction everything was just perfect. This show is so good and great that I really want to re-experience. Jesse pinkman and walter white,they are great💯"

10.0,7 March 2022,"Unpredictable, exciting, well-acted and well crafted, Breaking bad is the gold standard in Television achievement. Every single episode has a word to say and there are small deatils and forshadowing in earlier seasons you will only notice after you finished. You might get bored in earlier seasons, but Believe me it will be all worth it. Character development is the biggest strenght of Breaking bad, of course but other aspects are well done too. So if you haven't watched this show, stop wasting time and start binging the show and when it finishes, you have experienced an adventure you can rarely find an equivalent or similar one."
8.0,26 September 2022,10 out of 10. S1 mid S2 mid S2 good S4 amazing S5 goated .this is the best tv show I have ever watched but skyler really ruined evrything she was such a b**** I mean come on like in S1 when she was like my name is styler white yo my husband is walter white yo i swear if she would have slapped Jesse I would have mur**red her. Anyway my favourite scenes are when walter said this is not meth I thought he died my second favourite scen is when walter said I am the one who knocks. Anyway the scene when hank died was so sad I felt Walter's pain. Anyway I think that S5 is the best season imagine if Gus started working for Heisenberg.
9.0,14 March 2021,"One of the best series, best acting, best direction... and what all."
8.0,25 March 2021,"I've been watched this many many times, makes me feel like home."
10.0,14 February 2012,"Breaking bad is a good show but fails to achieve greatness on multiple levels due to a combination of bad acting, unrealistic writing and lack of grit.

Brysan Cranston plays Walter White who is terminally ill high school chemistry teacher who decides to leave his family with a substantial sum of money to support them in the future by cooking meth. There is no denying that Cranston is fine actor but the supporting cast and where the show gets let down the most.

The supporting characters do not come across as believable either with their dialogue or actions and sadly their acting is less than desirable. Like so many before it the show strives to show ""true"" grit but fails like so many American shows, I don't know whether it is the lighting or make up but everything is too shiny and clean and this is a common problem with American shows compared to British shows, which do often capture the rough and crude far better.

Breaking bad is good show but nothing special but worth a watch is nothing else is on."
10.0,2 May 2017,"Breaking Bad could have gone down in history as one of the greatest television shows ever if it had ended on a high note.The logical place to end it was at the end of the fourth season when Walt killed Gus Fring.Not only was it the greatest on screen death ever, they couldn't possibly ever create a more realistic and terrifying bad guy.The next season was spent trying to tie up all the loose ends and it was very unbelievable.Even worse, they decided to insult your intelligence by cutting the season in half and making it two seasons.That's a bitch move.They knew they had jumped the shark but they weren't done taking your money.So they forced a last season on us and it had a lame story and disappointing end.They went with the old tactic of bringing in Nazis to make the real bad guys look good.A last ditch attempt to win over anyone who thought Walt or Jesse weren't great people.All they succeeded at was ruining a great TV show.One good thing is that I never saw that end coming, because it was stupid.I'd recommend this show to everyone, just stop after the fourth season."

9.0,12 March 2021,What a freaking serie!!! Haisenberg is one of the best performances I've ever watched in tv or movies
10.0,10 September 2013,"I love Breaking Bad but honestly it is a bit over hyped. For my liking it's one of my favorite shows ever but I would have never expected it to have such an amazing rating. 8.5 IMDb rating sure but 9.4 is surprising. There are way too many filler episodes that build up for some epic craziness in the episodes following so you have to get through them. Also, I would have thought the acting, which I think is amazing, would hurt the shows rating. The actors play the characters so realistically that it might be mistaken for bad acting, especially Bryant Cranston playing Walter White. In real life, people in tough situations people tend to struggle with decision making. I believe that people who don't like this show, which I thought would be a greater number, don't understand that we are watching the characters from 3rd perspective. For us observing the events, it seems so obvious to how the characters should react, but put yourself in one of the characters shoes, lets say Walter's wife Skylar, and you would react SO SO similarly to how she did/does. The story line progresses so much throughout the seasons that it's hard to believe where it started. The build up to the main episodes is so great that it gets pretty predictable to what is the big thing that is suppose to happen but these main events are so crazy that even when we know what's going to happen, they are still surprising. If that even makes sense. You have to watch the show to understand what I am talking about. I highly recommend Breaking Bad. Try taking into consideration what I mentioned above when watching and you will be one of those people that understands the show and wont be skeptical of it."
9.0,3 January 2018,"This TV series is brilliant but. There is to much useless, sitting home, not working (and they have money trouble) wife. Annoying, ugly character absolutely useless in this story"

9.0,20 January 2013,"First of all, I really liked this series, and think the direction and acting was excellent. That said, I must ask ""why the hell couldn't they get a native Spanish speaker to play the part of Gustavo Fring?"" It is more than apparent that first, he is not a native Spanish speaker, and second, in no way resembles or speaks like a Chilean. I mean, c'mon - some 16% of the population of the U.S. is Hispanic, and in the huge pool of people they couldn't find a good or even great native Spanish- speaking actor, maybe even a Chilean? Even the main chemist in the lab in Mexico did not appear to be Mexican. To name just a few candidates for the Gustavo Fring part known in the U.S.: Edward James Olmos, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia, Benicio del Toro, Hector Elizondo, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Raul Julia, etc. Probably any of these very fine actors could have been coached to have a convincing Chilean accent. Héctor Noguera, one of the many fine Chilean actors, could have done the part without breaking a sweat. This is without considering that the character may or may not really have been Chilean, but that's another discussion, and in any case, he was SUPPOSED to have been Chilean, so he could at least speak like one. None of this is to disparage Giancarlo Esposito's work, which wasn't bad, although he only seemed to have a few facial expressions. Perhaps that was what the director wanted, given the character, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt there. In any case, great series."
8.0,19 March 2020,If there is any show that deserve 10/10 then it's Breaking Bad...!!!
10.0,2 March 2015,If I'm going to write a review on IMDb it has to be about Breaking Bad.My favorite TV Series.If you want a TV Series going to change your life style you have to watch Breaking Bad.What can i say... First season is go very well.Second is quite slow but not boring.And when the Season 3 come it's make you feel what i said on the first place.The other seasons follow the 3.I wish it didn't end.Because i didn't like the end.It has to ended but not like that.I don't know maybe happy ending going to be more cool.But I'm not judging.I only say end might be more happy then that.This is it all my words.I hope you enjoyed my review.This is my first so sorry if i bored you.
10.0,15 April 2021,"This is the best TV series ever. Apart from the fly episode, every episode of this series is worth watching."
8.0,8 August 2013,"Breaking Bad is one of the most addictive shows out there. I started watching with a little bit of skepticism but it proved me wrong very quickly.

Throughout the shows duration I have never seen a character transformation like the one Walter White undergoes throughout his various experiences. I'd always pictured Bryan Cranston as a ""nerdier"" actor however, this series completely changed my view of him.

By far one of the greatest modern shows. It has it all from action, suspense,comedy etc...

Definitely worth a watch!

8.0,15 June 2015,"Pure ten! The quality of the series just goes on and that the plot is progressing which is really rare. The second half of the 4th season and complete the fifth top peaks, no bad episodes, tense, almost every episode superb finishes. The entire fifth complete the best season ever! There dare I say it! Acting excellent, the script also. Come on, so I will not tell anything new. Oh details! Oh, how I was pleased to follow, some small detail may not go after him, but I just go and when you notice something and completed it and it turns out you're right. : yay: I greatly appreciate what they decided to do (only) season 5, but frickin good, than prostitute through the 10 or so season just for the money and viewer ship. The first season was the worst when compared to others. Warmly recommended. Malcolms father can really act"
9.0,3 November 2020,"Breaking Bad was one of those shows that everyone was watching or was going on about that I just seemed to miss. Fast forward to 2020 and lockdown gave me an excuse to visit this absolute gem! It is addictive viewing and becomes obsessive. So much so that I literally don't know what to do with my life now I've completed the series and the follow-up movie El Camino.... I'm stuck in a rut, I'd Better Call Saul.

Oh see what I did there.... I'll see myself out."

8.0,6 April 2021,"The storyline is unique and amazing and all of the character's in this show are just great especially gus fring my favorite character. After watching this series i was unable to watch other series for almost 2 months because the quality and the content of this show was so great that I was not fascinated to watch other series. It also has its prequel series ""better call Saul"" which is also amazing. I am eagerly waiting for its final season 6 to release."
9.0,12 July 2018,"So Powerful, Amazing Best Masterpiece in the History of Television Shows, I bet there will never, no show come even close to it.

I just Say Watch it, You will Remember me after Watching Last Episode."
9.0,28 September 2022,"Breaking Bad is very good from start to end. It has good actors and actresses. They play their roles very well.

For example the son of main character is half disabled like he can't walk without walking stick, he can't speak well and he's so good at playing the role. It's like he's a real disabled. Character development is good and the plot is good aswell. And finally the show has non-stop action besides the beginning it has a slow beginning but when it comes to the plot, the main event it gets very good and exciting. And there are some more spin offs like more shows and some films. The film is about the time after series. And the series about Breaking Bad is the one of the characters individual series. It tells about his life story and lots."
10.0,25 January 2022,"Great characters with excellent depth and development. Slightly melodramatic dialogue that is lively and not just words off a script. Very entertaining and spans the scope through human despair, hope and triumph. Excellent actors that breathe the characters."
8.0,18 October 2015,
9.0,11 February 2022,"A show I would suggest everyone to watch! Definitely worth watching! Brilliant acting, intense scenes and nerve wracking moments. Jesse & Gus would be my favorites."
9.0,29 December 2010,"Few times I've become addicted to a TV series. I started with Breaking Bad just randomly, and I don't regret it. Just watch the first episode and you will know what I mean.

Although the main subject may be a little bit unpopular for wide audiences and perhaps unsuited to kids and youngsters, I would recommend this show for the rest of us. The story goes about an underachieved high-school chemistry teacher and family dad, that one day is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Since then, he will try to gather as much money as possible to sustain his family for whenever he is gone and to pay his cancer treatment. He finds a gold mine when he applies his knowledge to the meth business (chemistry freaks may enjoy the technical stuff in the episodes), and he finds himself and his business partner in a number of kafkian situations that will keep the audience tied to their sits.

Cranson and the rest of the cast make a hell of a performance (note: Cranson got 2 consecutive emmys for the leading drama role beating Dr. House and the Lost guy). In my opinion, special mentions are also due to Hank, the DEA officer, and Saul, the attorney; they make outstanding performances in their secondary roles.

All in all this is a TV series with a very fine balance between suspense, drama and even some comedy, with an original plot and with an outstanding crew.

2 closing comments: Do not feel guilty if you find yourself with the need of watching 4 or 5 episodes per day, and yay!, they are coming back in July 2011!"
10.0,3 April 2015,"The specialty of this show is, the consistency. Through out the series(except for 'Fly';was bit of boring)in every episode the suspense, intelligence in every second of the script was displayed.

I would say almost every character did a fabulous job. Walter White, Jr. White, Hank, Jesse, Todd's crew, Skyler, Mile, Gus were exceptional.

I think the show scores highly, with the perfect end of the show. Some people say the show has a tragic end, but some people say it doesn't. Isn't that awesome. A show has a fabulous end and different dimensions to the end."
10.0,27 February 2022,"You know what's the caption is yah it's the best. I'll call it as a masterpiece.the way Vince created the character Walter white from a normal person to meth drug kingpin Heisenberg was absolute direction and character arc .and finale was awesome.brilliant writing, screenplay, technically beautiful. The name Walter white will be forever in the history of television series. Walter white is an art. The series paces and gets very very good in every seasons.i'll keep telling this as a one of the best until season 4 after I changed my mind as this a best show ever the last season is very well and good and perfect in all ways.kudos to all the actors who acted in this best show. Now more words to describe this show.

Hitler's rating:10/10."
10.0,4 April 2021,Everything from the plot to the cast is just amazing.
10.0,31 August 2012,"Have you ever experienced a life changing event which has turned your complete world upside down. I can't say I have, but I know someone who has. His name is Walter White: Loving father, true husband, dedicated chemistry teacher, crystal meth master chef. ""Wait a second!"" you think. Something in that sentence didn't fit in. You're damn right it didn't, and that's what makes Breaking Bad fit in perfectly in the series hall of fame!

50 year old Walter White has a teenage son with cerebral palsy, trying his best to fit in, and a pregnant wife not afraid to speak her mind. When Walter learns that he has lung cancer and probably hasn't got very long to live, he decides that he must do Whatever IT Takes to secure the future of his family. As far as I am concerned, producing crystal meth serves perfectly well as the IT and Walter seems to share my view on that. He's got the brains, he knows the chemistry but lacks the street experience. Better gain some.

Breaking Bad is all about conflicting opposites with an antihero leading the way by erasing the fine line between right and wrong, good and bad. How long can you keep keep a double life double? How much bad is acceptable in the attempts to achieve something good? There are many questions to answer, but there are no clear answers to be found. Once the iron chains of the law have been broken there ain't no easy way to mend them again, unless you want to play the part of the missing link. Walter sure doesn't and is driven further and further down the path he has chosen, transforming into someone no-one had expected. As long as I can be the spectator watching from the other side of the screen I'll cheer it all on with eyes big as steering wheels screaming: ""Break that law! Break it bad!""

Oh, did I mention that Walter's brother-in-law works for the drug enforcement administration?"
9.0,11 January 2021,Love this show. Walter white is a genius in everything he did. True master mind.
10.0,20 March 2020,I really love this show and every thing related to it i give it 9.5 out of 10 because of slow story telling at the first couple seasons of the show but after that you literally can not stop watching this show.
10.0,3 November 2020,"You will relate to the main character and you did not know and the main character is a good or bad person, but in the end, you will sympathize with him"
10.0,5 April 2021,"I watched Bryan Cranston transform a rather ordinary chemistry teacher who caught a bad break into a dichotomous antagonist/protagonist with awe. His world was filled with characters (some equally dichotomous, some not) that made this one of the most gripping dramas on TV. Walter White's simultaneous assent (into the drug dealing elite) and descent (into unadulterated evil) was done deftly. Vince Gillian weaves an arc that is as addicting as the blue meth Gus Fring peddled. A must see."
10.0,18 May 2021,As I know there's nothing available on OTP to compare with this show..
10.0,21 July 2014,"After watching Breaking Bad , it seems that I've made some legendary childhood memories. This series made me cry,gasp and I could hear my heart drumming most of the times. Aaron Paul did an awesome work. Jessie was/is my favorite Breaking Bad character. The part which I loved in the entire series is that WALTER WHITE NEITHER DIES OF CANCER NOR GETS KILLED BY MAFIAS. He was the sole reason behind his death. And that part where he says to Skyler ,I DID IT FOR MYSELF. IT MADE ME FEEL ALIVE. That part was just legendary. I just cant believe that its over. Gilligan, please surprise us. I still cant believe that he is dead. Jessie on the other part was the only one who got out alive. But man,he deserved much better. He was just a kid after-all. Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) Totally amazing work! I could feel that change. From S1 to S5 , a complete transformation."
10.0,25 December 2018,Great story line with a great start but progresses slowly with predictable happenings.
10.0,26 March 2015,"There are no words to fully describe ""Breaking Bad"". It is truly a show of its own. Its a show that draws such a personal attachment to all the characters...a show that make you feel with the story and leaves you every single episode wanting to hit ""Play Next Episode"" on your Netflix account. Sure some episodes are slow but its for a reason, every second of every episode is for a reason. If you have been living under a rock for the last few years and haven't watched this show...I suggest you do. Its the greatest show in TV history and there will never be another like it! Its dark yet has humorous moments and will leave you at the edge of your couch every time! WATCH BREAKING BAD!!!!!!"
10.0,22 June 2013,"This is the best show that's ever been on TV and I have only just started series 5, the casting is perfect, the characters unforgettable and the story completely unpredictable, I cant recommend Breaking Bad enough and the people I have told about it have all loved it! The character progression is just fantastic as you see it unfold, I just don't know what will fill its place when I finish season 5. Walter White is the man, Jesse amazing, Gus is terrifying, Mike also, Hank is great as the DEA man and the numerous bad guys that we come across just make this show the most watchable, nerve wracking, tense and basically fantastic watch of all time. Watch it!"
9.0,11 October 2011,"Breaking bad is in my opinion the greatest TV show of all time, and I think it would be hard to deny it is one of the most neglected TV show in terms of TV ratings. The writing is unbelievable, the acting amazing with superb character development down to the minor players. My favorite character is Saul Goodman who isn't even in half the episodes, he's hilarious, almost everything thing he says cracks me up. It kills me that the show is not more well known than it is, I put it up there with the sopranos and the wire. It deserves so much credit as well because it is so original, the subject, characters, and story line. I just had to put pen to paper on this one, my man Bryan Cranston has done too good of job. Thank you so much for all your work!"
10.0,10 February 2015,"Breaking Bad has every aspect of a show that could possibly be right right. The characters, the drama, the acting, the cinematography, directing, editing, suspense, action, and writing. It is perhaps the most baffling, surprising, pleasing television series ever to enter production. Breaking Bad sure was good, but who doesn't know that now? This review is for those of you who haven't seen it, and the review is simply telling those of you who haven't seen it one simple little thing, a thing so simple it will change your aspect of life forever: What are you doing with your life? You missed a major landmark in Earth. Go watch it!"
10.0,24 September 2019,"""Breaking Bad"" is an incredible TV Show on television to watch, for the hole entire audience around the world, can't stop talking about it. ""Vince Gilligan is the best creator of the show"". ""Bryan Cranston is phenomenal"", and ""Aaron Paul is incredible"". Best performance on television that deserves the golden globe awards, and Oscars winning best actors, best picture and best winning TV show on television. And you can see it again, and again, and all over again."

8.0,22 February 2015,"A rave review of Breaking Bad doesn't do the show justice. My words have been said by many, but I'll say it again, Breaking Bad is the greatest show of all time. It goes to another level. The story is intriguing and, in the sense that many men with little income are diagnosed with the financial and physical burden of cancer, quite relatable. The use of symbolism is evident and is done in such an intelligent way. The show is written with such versatility and excellence. Vince Gilligan is able to write each of his characters in the own way; he uses wit and humor, while also effectively writing dark, dramatic scenes and lines. The acting is - for the most part - unbelievable, which is mostly a testament to the show's star, Bryan Cranston. He captivates audiences with his dilemma that they sympathize with, and he presents a dramatic, and sometimes laughable character, which he brings to life. Supporting roles filled by the likes of Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Dean Norris, Giancarlo Esposito, Bob Odenkirk, and Jonathan Banks are performed brilliantly. The show is directed in such an interesting and unique way.

What really goes a long way with Breaking Bad is its standalone nature. You'll never watch a show similar (except its spin-off, Better Call Saul, which is also phenomenal). WATCH THIS SHOW AND WATCH IT NOW."
10.0,12 May 2020,Good season but many will find it boring but is one of the best
10.0,10 April 2015,"BREAKING BAD is best serial in the television history. This show is beyond comparison. Many people's and critics compare this show with Game of Thrones but Breaking Bad is far much better. I watched Game of Thrones and yeah it's good. But not good as Breaking Bad because Breaking Bad is perfect show.

I can give this show 100 stars out of 10. Story is brilliant and well told. It's perfectly balanced. If I talk about performances then I can say every actor plays their characters beautifully. Bryan Cranston as Walter White is great. What an acting by Bryan. Aaron Paul as Jessie and Anna Gunn as Skyler is Great. Betsy Brandt, RJ Mitte and Dean Norris are great supporting actors. Bod Odenkirk as Saul is a great comical character.

This show is best. For me BREAKING BAD is the best serial ever made in TV shows history.. Must Watch Show. Thanks to VINCE GILLIGAN..."
10.0,2 July 2013,"First of all: Breaking Bad is easily the best show ever made, great story, brilliant actors, 10 out of 10. Only one thing is a bit puzzling.. what is the point about all those allusions to Germany? Many characters (an they are not all nice guys) have names of German origin: Family Schrader, Ted Beneke, Gale Boetticher, Mike Ehrmantraut, Gretchen Schwartz, Dan Wachsberger etc. Walter White calls himself ""Heisenberg"" (a German physicist). Jessy uses terms like ""Adolf"" and ""Hitler"" to show his disrespect to certain people. Hank says things like ""we are not in Nazi-Germany"" or ""there are enough Germans here to invade Poland"". Last not least the company ""Madrigal"" that controls the drugdeals is located in Germany. To much for coincidence, or not. Anyways, the makers seam to have a special affinity to our country:)"

9.0,24 November 2013,"This show is the worst. Boring, stagnant cinematography. Horribly predictable, mundane writing. Worst casting ever assembled. Unbelievably irrelevant, soulless soundtrack. By-the-book editing. Boring subject matter.

I feel as though at times, RL STINE was capable of producing more suspenseful material. This series is the television equivalent of some of the early works of Chad Kroeger, and his friends at Nickelback.

But none of that's true.

You've never been told a tighter story, and you'll never see a better show. Watch it. Watch it again. I don't care what season you got to, finish it. And sorry if you genuinely enjoy the likes of Nickelback. I'm really, very sorry for you.

10/10."
10.0,1 November 2020,Great to binge watch never gets old. Plus since el comeno came out to finish this series
10.0,28 April 2015,"The story and acting are incredible. I think we need a new word for what Aaron Paul does. It's so real it can't be ""acting""! He has to be the best actor of our time. And Bryan Cranston and others: on the same level. Incredible. So sorry it's over. Still hoping they'll bring it back somehow as now I have nothing to watch (that compares). The way the story is mixed with action, you become part of it and it is so real at times that it can be hard to watch! An emotional roller coaster! To see the change in Walter White over time is insane. For me, I started out sympathizing a little but by the end of the series, I was ready for him to die (like most people in his life I think, including him). What a change and brilliant the way it was handled!"

I just finished S5E16 second time and I am really starting missing it.How could I live without all the breaking bad 's characters."
10.0,1 June 2012,"When straight-laced high school chemistry teacher Walter White is diagnosed with cancer, he turns to cooking meth hoping to sock away some big money for his family before he dies. But the cancer might not get a chance to kill him after all... his new profession might just do it faster.

From frame one... of episode one... of season one... this series will grab you by the soft and hard parts and not let go. You will be drop-jaw-wowed by the production quality, scripts, acting, and execution of this stand-out series.

True artistry and brilliance is transparent in writing and filmography so that what appears to come through is real life in all its gritty, ugly glory. Breaking Bad delivers in a way few series ever have. The casting is superb and virtually every actor is stellar. The twists and turns of the plot are delicious and the ride is as intoxicating, unpredictable and addictive as the killer meth Walter cooks up.

This AMC gem is every bit a premium cable channel production from start to finish. You will swear you're watching HBO or Showtime. If only every show on TV was even half as good! Breaking Bad deserves every industry award and accolade to be had."
10.0,7 March 2015,"I just watched this recently - not sure how I missed it when it was originally broadcast.

This series will put you on an emotional roller coaster of epic proportions. You'll change your mind over and over again with how you feel about certain characters, but in a good way. By the time it's over you will feel completely satisfied with everything.

The acting was phenomenal, as was the story. Bravo to all those who were involved in making this series.

You will NOT be disappointed.

Looking forward to what happens in the spin off of ""Better Call Saul""!"
10.0,11 July 2011,"This show is a mystery to me. I finished season 1 a few minutes ago which I had started a few days back. I don't really dig ""Drama"" genre that well unless it has something extraordinary to add to it, much less the real-life day-to-day stuff. This show, somehow, falls into that category for me. But there is something about it that makes me go back to it again and again. Bryan Cranston makes you feel sorry for him, embarrassed for him, feel his insecurity, feel his stupidity, feel his determination, watch him in awe and be blown over every once in a while. Aaron Paul, from what I've seen, is just fantastic, best character apart from Bryan. This guy really pulls off the irony and the associated comedy really well. A very different and fresh show. Have a watch. Good chance you'd like it. Pretty sure you never thought about Chemistry this way. Cheers!"
10.0,15 February 2015,"It says something about a TV show when even the episodes could be called, 'filler' are entertaining and do something great. Breaking Bad is a show where no episode, scene or moment is wasted. Everything about it is brilliant, the writing is masterful, handling characters and plots with ease with each season building on the next. Delivering both funny, profound, shocking and heartbreaking moments. The directing is superb especially considering they film each episode in only eight days. It always tries to do different things while always serving the story. Visually it is wondrous to behold. The acting is top notch, Bryan Cranston delivers Walter Whites slow decline into villainy wonderfully and Aaron Paul will only be remembered for his role as Pinkman.

This show delivers, when people say it's great, they mean it. It is one of the best shows I have ever seen."
10.0,5 May 2021,"I watched Breaking Bad after seeing Cranston was in it. I never previously searched for stuff with him but love Malcolm in the Middle -- only Cranston could have played Hal. Likewise, I felt he really made the show for Br Ba, although alone it is a tremendous piece of work. By any definition Br Ba set a new standard for dramatic thrillers. There's still nothing like it. On a personal note, I give a thumbs down to any review calling it a comedy-drama. Though there may be some humor behind the idea of a science professor becoming involved with meth, with Pinkman's incompetence in very serious situations, or with Saul's persona the series itself is not meant to be funny, imo. I've watched the series a number of times and I'm just trying to understand what could be such a humorous thread as to call the series itself comedy. Unfortunately, there is no specifics in those reviews so I'm at a loss, but hoping those people will seek help with their depraved sense of humor. For me, it is a very gritty and profound story that shocks even the most worldly viewer just when you start to feel safe. In the trivia section (with lots of great tidbits), we learn that Gilligan had used Cranston in an episode of X Files where he played opposite of his comedic persona, and states Gilligan knew from there only Cranston could play Walter White. He also is quoted as saying he wanted White to go from a Mr. Chips type to Scarface. I actually was rooting for Heisenberg (a tribute to Werner Heisenberg, who formulated the uncertainty principle) and disliked the ending initially. But as Anthony Hopkins stated, Br Ba is so amazing it can be compared to a Shakespearean tragedy. I was also one of those who strongly dislike Skylar, played exquisitely by Anna Gunn. Not because she was a ""strong female lead"" as she once claimed was the reason so many disliked the character, but because she was -- probably very intentionally -- the main antagonist to our lead guy, Walter White. Another interesting note is that Showtime, TNT, and HBO all declined the series when it was pitched & FX picked it up but dropped it for the show Dirt (I bet they all regret that now). Truly a mind-bending series that introduced us all to the overthetop facial & verbal expressions/emotion that are now so predominate in every genre. If there was ever a spin-off worthy character from the series, you would think it'd be Saul, however for me that series was so detached from Br Ba that it was relegated to my ""maybe later"" list. I think the series died with -- well, you know..."

10.0,10 August 2013,"You know Hype? Yea It can be a beach. I've been following IMDb for a while now and I can honestly say that there's a certain demographic that votes for TV shows and movies on this site. In this new millennium there have been new shows with great ideas like Game of thrones,Dexter and of course Breaking Bad taking over modern television, but unfortunately all of these shows are overrated. I don't want to bash breaking bad-The show definitely has some good qualities and ideas going for it, but I just cant feel underwhelmed by most parts on this show. The writing and duologue are just average and the characters personal lives are about as interesting as my next door neighbors(which I can actually care about).

Compared to the witty and thought provoking duologue of dramas like six feet under, Oz, Sopranos, Shameless,Walking Dead and The Good Wife-Breaking Bad can just not add up. Don't get me wrong I wont doubt Vince Gilligan as a decent script writer,but this show has too many pot holes for it to be called the best thing on television. To elaborate the show has a lot of dead time that just leaves it to meander. The characters are unconvincing and the duologue cannot support them and just falls by the waste side.There are people that I respect that love thisshow, but I just cant help but feel a personal tragedy that I cant get into Breaking bad.

I remember seeing the score on IMDb, metacrtic and hearing about all of the accolades the show has gotten. So I decided to watch the show from the beginning to catch up with the loyal fans. I really didn't like season 1 and 2 and found the rest was thoroughly enjoyable, but earlier today during the amc marathon I wanted to show my mom,sister and grandma breaking bad. Sadly they weren't into it and unfortunately neither was I. For some reason the spark was gone that was once there from season 3-5. All the episodes seem boring and pointless. It almost seem like I was watching a boring Tarantino movie with no plot or duologue(And we all know that's what makes his movies special.

In the Top 20 alone there are shows with violence,drugs and sex.Breaking Bad has all of the above and im not saying that's a bad thing, but it seems like breaking bad is relying on its shock value to keep people intrigued. Breaking Bad is a show that clearly has a lot of hype and a cult fanbase backing it, but the acclaim for this show is baffling to me..People act like its the best thing since sliced bread .There are better TV shows out there than this(An average 99 average score on metacrtic and loads of nominations/Awards!! are you fuggin serious??) This show is average at best, but hey that's my opinion. Dexter,Mad Men and Breaking Bad they all have one thing i common: Their all overrated and rely on style instead of actual substance, but they do have their moments which deserves some consideration of checking them out.

It's freaking great to see the idea of a show like breaking bad taking off on regular cable television and I'm worried that the hype has affected my opinion for the worse, but I felt it was kind of necessary to make a review for people looking for a little more elaboration,and possibly a dissenting opinion. Thank you for your time. This is just my opinion."
10.0,14 January 2011,"Disgusting, hyper-realistically gritty, painfully frustrating in that ""I don't want to watch but I'll look through my fingers"" kinda way . . . yet eminently watchable and extremely funny. I don't know how they get through the situations they do but fate always lends a hand, albeit digging a bigger hole each time.

Every single aspect of this production is a little quirky - plot, script, casting, acting, cinematography, music. Nothing is straight laced which makes it endearing. But that's not likely to be the adjective that comes to mind after the pilot episode . . . think Tarantino does Weeds.

Just remember not to eat anything beforehand."
10.0,28 November 2019,Some people have said outs the best tv written series ever. I thought it was ok. The main character was taken a little too far from the original place he started. The sequel to this was horrible.
8.0,5 May 2021,"I've never enjoyed a show like i enjoyed Breaking Bad. While the first season is kinda slow, it gets better around the second half of season 2, and absolutely amazing at season 4 and 5. It gets only better, and with amazing prequel ""Better call Saul"" and El Camino movie, this universe seems far from being left."

10.0,15 February 2015,"I had to write a review, I simply had to do it. I never understood what all the fuss was about when people said the show was one of the best ever until I watched it a few weeks ago. I watched the whole five seasons in just a few days and words cant express the way the show made me feel about how shows should be made. I could just imagine the love viewers must have over the years for the characters. You just can't forget the characters unlike other mediocre shows.

The acing is top notch, the directing is pretty flawless, the writing is genius, the editing is so tight that if you skip five seconds you might miss a major twist.

To see Walter White grow from an ordinary teacher to a criminal drug lord is worth every bit of your precious time. The themes of Family, Loyalty, Greed are explored and displayed on screen with such precise accuracy.

If I have to recommend a show to a person on his or her deathbed, this is it. In the words of Jesse Pinkman: What you waiting for... Bitch."
10.0,27 June 2014,"This's a serious story which indeed looks so realistic that in many ways it resemble how people really falls into crime! Rise in the story is scripted so well that in end if you would have been asked to resign from your job just to watch the remaining series, you would do that and think of yourself later :)

It's a masterpiece. I highly recommend this as the most watchful series. I'm a serious fan of Bryan Cranston, so I won't say that he has done role of his lifetime :) but he surely did a class act in this epic series for which he would always be remembered for and without him as ""Walter White"" ""Breaking Bad"" would have not been THE ""Breaking Bad"".

Aaron Paul has also done a classic role I enjoyed it but the real deal is Bryan's character ""Walter White"". Story revolves around him. Once you start watching this series you'll feel for all characters, you'll develop emotions for him and in end when everyone else hates Walt you'll become his greatest supporter!!"
10.0,15 February 2022,"10 out of 10, but I still have an unpopular opinion. I think of the show would've been cast differently it could've been way better. Add into that the need for a slightly higher budget... I just think this show could've been executed better. And I know saying that will be controversial. The writings incredible and you can't beat it as far as the drama is concerned. Also if you haven't already watch the show what rock have you been living under?"

10.0,6 September 2014,"I have almost completed watching it in its entirety for the second time. Maybe when I was a small child I watched a couple of shows such as Inspector Gadget and Heathcliff in their entirety, but in my adult years I mostly could not have cared less about TV and have watched only a handful of modern shows until this show was released on Netflix. It's the best TV show of all time, and it will probably have that distinction for decades to come, like the Beatles. I actually continue to like movies much more than TV shows, but I cannot even think of a movie that I like nearly as much as this show. The Beatles of movies has yet to be released, I guess. :)"

10.0,20 September 2012,"while there are awesome and successful shows like prison break, dexter, and house etc. I've noticed a trend that after around season 4 or 5 and so on. there is the sudden decline in writing and ritualistic storyline to the point of being unavoidably predictable or immensely CONTRIVED. this is where breaking bad stands above the rest.

one thing i didn't quite like was that walter's close relative brother in law just HAD to be D.E.A. that being said, breaking bad is surprisingly filled with ingenious humor and you cant even tell for the most part whether intentional or not...then hits you out of nowhere how serious it can be. the plot twists doesn't feel fabricated and over the top but its in a rather more realistic perspective which works really well.

unique show. continues to be interesting!"
10.0,24 April 2015,
10.0,21 May 2023,"It's too slow paced, watching the show on 1.5 speed helps. I don't like the depressing message and the underlying quote having an average life with an average teacher job is sad quote. It makes me feel sad about my own average life. I do like the science stuff. Acting is good. Setup of characters it's thought out and interesting. So far it's not advertising too greatly for drug usage. It does have a bit of a Dexter vibe so I might get the feeling I've already seen this. Seeing the 9.5 average rating here on IND B will make me watch a couple more episodes, too see what the fuss is about, new review coming up."

I'm not some weirdo who would normally do something like that, lol, but this show invoked such intense emotion in me that I was literally compelled to give it a standing ovation out of genuine thankfulness that I was able to experience this.

9.5/10 is not high enough. This show is an absolute dead on 10/10 perfect."

(What else could I say?)

10.0,7 September 2019,"I have seen the series Gomorra, that made a real impression and impact for me. I do not think you can compare these 2 shows, but I think because of that I am not too much impressed with this series.

I have watched many episodes a day. Not always to know what will happen and sometimes I did not want to see it anymore. The acting is great, the camerawork is nice, the characters make mostly logic choices and there is not much luck involved. It looks like a raw show, just like in real life.

But that is why I do not like some parts of the relationships and how the characters are communicating. Sometimes they look like some children who have lost their toys. Maybe that is the point, but I did not like it. And when they almost come to an understanding, it will go wrong again with full force. I do not think that is realistic.

I have also the feeling the series wants to be a lot of things together and that is why I am a bit confused. There is almost no gore, yes sometimes a few body parts are flying around, but suddenly you see half a face. Not shocking, but I thought: why? And that only happens once. And the balance between serious stuff and comedy is tipping over as the series progressing. I think Fargo did a better job at that. Is it realistic how the drug world operates? Not really, you only see the top of the iceberg. The violence the drug world is using then? I have not seen so much about the all powerful kartel, but suddenly it is gone... So it is action? Yes there is enough action. It also likes to show you what the actions do to other people related to the main characters, but also not too deep.

What I am trying to say is, I am left with a bit of an empty feeling, because I did not know exactly what I saw. So I think it is a drama/soap/action and it is a good one. I am not sure that I can relate to the main characters fully. It is difficult to know what is going on in the heads of the characters. Or maybe I am the idiot here...

So wanted to watch the next episode, I do not want to see more if it. It is good like this. It was a nice ending of a good series."
10.0,26 April 2015,If you are looking for a series that you want to enjoy more than any other TV series I'll suggest you to watch Breaking Bad.This series is far better than any other TV series I've ever seen and believe me I've seen many good series but no other series came even close to Breaking Bad.Everything about BB is just so simple and yet so good you'll end up amazed or shocked many times throughout the series.BB is like an everyday struggle of a common man who is forced to do extraordinary things that will shatter lives of many individuals.Strong performances from Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.I'll say simply best TV series ever made and also no other series in future can take place of BB. #YoBitch

8.0,28 August 2019,"A marvelous show. It is kinda boring at the beginning but gains pace after season 2. First 2 seasons too have great moments but it's all dissolved in the family drama. 3rd season is a mixed bag. It contains great episodes. An unpopular opinion ""Fly"" is the only episode I didn't liked in the season. Season 4 is my favourite. One of the best I have ever seen in TV. Season 5 is a bit long but beautifully wrap up the show."

The negative part of this series is sometimes you can get bored easily because The theme is always same.And sometimes you think that can a man do all of it? And that make this series far away from realism. And if you make Show that has been improved from a realist theme you should keep on doing it. or else it makes people who watches it sick.But if you making this for money you are right Because nobody wants to see something ordinary.But still better than all the other crazy staff

10.0,3 January 2022,"No wit, No humour, and definitely NOT suitable for the kids! Breaking Bad (2008) feeds the hungry self-centred know it all's by having its protagonist be most selfish and foul to his accomplices! How can anyone find this enjoyable? Not to mention the poor attempts at comedy, it's clear they're trying to imitate the greats such as ""The Plank"" and ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". Brilliant. JUST BRILLIANT. Well done Hollywood, yet another failure. Oh, for Petes Sake! There is NO commitment to actually entertaining the kids whatsoever, which is highly questionable for its PG rating! Don't get fuddled up, the acting is gorgeous, completely beyond my comprehension. But do not waltz around and spit and sneeze on kids hopes and dreams with such twisted episodic concepts! The kids were very disappointed with this one, and I concur. Definitely skip this, for the sake of your children - At least the writers are self aware of how ""breakingly BAD"" their show is!"
10.0,27 January 2014,"Non-stop adrenalin-rush crime-drama following the story of Albuquerque chemistry teacher Cranston turning into a methamphetamine kingpin in order to secure his family's finances after being diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, calling upon ex-student Paul to assist in the streetwise aspect of the drug business. Cranston is perfect in one of the most mind-blowing hero-to-villain transformations, backed by unforgettable recurring characters like Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk), Gustavo ""Gus"" Fring (played by Giancarlo Esposito), Mike Ehrmantraut (played by Jonathan Banks), Todd Alquist (played by Jesse Plemons), Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (played by Laura Fraser), Gale Boetticher (played by David Costabile), Victor (played by Jeremiah Bitsui) and the Salamanca Family (played by Mark Margolis, Raymond Cruz, and twins Daniel and Luis Moncada). Unfortunately, the major supporting roles played by Paul, Gunn, Norris, Mitte, Brandt and Quezada all take their turns at being incredibly annoying or ridiculously codependent on the despicable main character. The show's intensity ends up overshadowing some great themes and symbols involving moral consequences and family devotion. Also, for such a nail-biting show, the ante isn't actually raised all that much in hindsight. Still, and most importantly, it's an overall excellent show—actually one of the few series that literally gets better and better as it progresses. High recommended.

And that, it is certainly the best when it comes to being the most bad-ass show there was/is/will be on television! I am a bit late to review this title but I started watching it just about last month and it is so addictive that it has had me hooked onto it until I craved for more... Breaking Bad is a journey of a certain Walter White, an underachieving man, a man way too qualified for the job he does, the wages he earns, a man barely able to provide for his family which he loves more than himself is left with no option when he understands that he has cancer and little time on his hands; to choose the path that seems impossible for him- a timid, meek guy....a path were red is shed for green...lives are put at risk on a daily basis. He takes on the role of a manufacturer of crystal meth along with Jesse Pinkman a former student of his, who is a small time drug dealer! And he chose to break bad!!

One flaw has kept me from giving it a ten. Everything to do with Skyler's pregnancy and with tbe baby just doesn't ring true, as if it was written by someone remote from the subject. Women of forty - however, glamorous - do not sail through pregnancy problem- free, occasionally stroking their bellies to remind us of what's going on. As for Holly, she must be the most unobtrusive infant in the history of mankind - occasionally someone shoves a bottle in her mouth or dandles her on their knee but she is simply not a presence in the family and seems happy to spend her time sitting in a baby chair looking demure. She also doesn't seem to be aging at the right pace. As I said, the only flaw I found."

Thats quite a bit of time I have to commit to the series.

This has been the first series that I have watch all the way through. Binged watched actually. So far, other than sitcoms, Breaking Bad is the only drama series that I have watched every episode, which totals out to be 1 day 22 hours and 30 minutes of non-stop viewing.

It was worth it!"
10.0,16 May 2019,"It's a series that has several genre (police, drama, thriller and black comedy) The country of origin is the United States. The original language is the American language. There are 5 seasons. There are 62 episodes. Breaking Bad is the story of Walter White, 50 years, a professor of chemistry at a high school in New Mexico. To support Skyler, his pregnant wife, and Walt Junior, his disabled son, he has to work twice. His already gloomy life becomes downright black when he learns that he has an incurable lung cancer. Doctors do not give him more than two years to live. To quickly raise a lot of money to protect his family, Walter sees only one solution: to use his knowledge of chemistry to make and sell crystal meth, a synthetic drug that pays a lot. He affers Jesse, one of his former students who has become a small second-clss dealer, to team up with him. The improvised duo set up a traveling lab in an old motorhome. This unexpected association will lead them into a series of adventures both comical and pathetic. What i like in this series is that there are a lot of adventures and that a lot of things happen to the main actor (the chemist), sometimes it's surprising, sad, funny, and sometimes even horrible, it is the mix of emotions that can be felt in this series that i love the most. In addittion the universe is quite special and the story is really intriguing, which interests me a lot. I will give the series a score of 9/10 because i would have liked it to continue."
10.0,6 August 2018,"Awesome, brilliant, emotional, and every amazing things"
10.0,24 September 2021,Beat show I've ever seen. I would give it more than 10 stars in rating if I could. Definitely a must see!
10.0,24 May 2018,"Well first off, What the hell is there to say about Breaking Bad that hasn't already been said. Even though Better Call Saul is now in it's 4th season and is due to air at some stage this year, Breaking Bad is still very much at the forefront of AMC's hit list and hands down one the most addictive show I've ever seen in my life .

The first season starts off simple enough. Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher, discovers he has stage 3 lung cancer (despite being a non-smoker) and after discovering how much money can be made in the drug trade he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student. It's there they begin manufacturing Methamphetamine as a way of financial security for Walt's pregnant wife and teenage son who has cerebral palsy.

Later on in the first season, Walt and Jesse get introduced to Tuco Salamanca, an extremely unpredictable and violent psychopath (played brilliantly by Raymond Cruz). Walt and Jesse sell the first batch of their product to Tuco and make their first fat stack of cash by doing so. The last scene of the first season really sets the standard for the rest of the series and gives you a solid idea of what's ahead.

I won't spoil anything for those of you that haven't had the chance to experience this masterpiece of a tv series yet, but the later seasons of Breaking Bad introduce more high profile figures of the underworld, shows A grade character development of the main cast of characters and shows the dire consequences and toll it takes on families who are caught up in the dark world of crime.

Of course, this series probably isn't for everybody, that's understandable considering it's content but Breaking Bad is hands down one of the best series ever made. The first time watching it, I couldn't believe how quick i got through the first season. It's just that kind of show. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted. Dangerously addictive, just like meth!

10/10"
10.0,23 May 2020,I have just downloaded the imdb app simply to review this masterpiece. Most of the tv shows know how to start but very few of them knows how to end. And breaking bad sets an glorious example on what a perfect ending is.
10.0,3 February 2022,"A series that had a wide perspective in various fields, although it may not have a deep philosophical meaning or criticize a deep subject, but it has always entertained you with its ups and downs and addictive stories, as well as professional actors throughout the series. And it has become more than a TV series and has become one of the leading figures in the art of cinema and filmmaking and one of the interests of individuals and students in the science of chemistry."
9.0,7 July 2021,"Abbot and Costello meet El Chapo.

Sorry your review is too short."
10.0,9 November 2018,It's probably the best TV show ever. You should watch it.
10.0,20 March 2023,"So many things to love about this show. There is not a bad episode of this show that I would not want to watch. I must have watched this series through from front to back at least 4 or 5 times. Each time I noticed a small tidbit that I did not notice previously and still feel like there might be something I might have missed that ties back to one of the story lines. No shows that I've watched have the ability to keep you engaged when watching multiple times, but somehow Breaking Bad does it. Great show, great spinoffs, great cast and crew and great job Peter Gould and Vince Gilligan for bringing everything together for an amazing experience. Thumbs up all the way around."
10.0,14 July 2013,"I can't stop myself watching this movie till end.In short it is a nice movie.Naturalization is very fine as well as characters.It is different form the past stories.a struggling high school chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer at the beginning of the series.He turns to a life of crime,producing and selling something with a former student.This is all for creating a nice situation inside the movie.The viewers will never get bored.it is difficult to write for Walter White because the character is so dark and morally questionable.Another nice thriller is that Walter's wife who was pregnant with their second child prior to his diagnosis,and who becomes increasingly suspicious of her husband after he begins behaving in unfamiliar ways.nice to watch movie."
10.0,27 August 2018,
9.0,13 March 2019,This series paints the ultimate anti hero story - beautifully directed and acted. The story will enthrall and make you cringe as you see the characters descend into depravity through the drug trade

10.0,4 September 2021,
10.0,13 July 2013,"I felt compelled to write because I really enjoyed breaking bad, not all of it, but it had its thrilling moments, ones really memorable are the turtle scene, bombing Gus and the second encounter with Tuco.

What I really need to say, the fact that Walter is victimizing himself in way that you can relate to is well crafted. He has a grandiosity dementia which is the product of his acute intelligence, yet sometimes, he is sensitive and breakable by the least of emotions. Severe paranoia mixed with psychopathic morale is the actual trade mark of Heisenberg.Creating such a character is really a job well done! We are almost days away of the final 8 episodes, and let me be frank for a moment, the first 8 were not up to par. The absence of a powerful adversary kinda took away the magic of Breaking Bad, Walter is going down, one way or the other, but I hope his fall is going to be as memorable as the fall of Hitler, if you know what I mean.

P.S: Spinning off Saul, eh, fed up with corrupted lawyer drama, I would rather see a crossover between Hannibal and Heisenberg."
9.0,5 July 2017,"When i saw the first 3 episodes i wasn't really thrilled by this...As i went on seeing this it got more interesting..,and at the end of 2nd season i was blown away by the story,twists and turns. So hang in there for first few episodes after that you cant stop yourself from watching this. And for those who think breaking bad is boring guys seriously there's something wrong with you."
10.0,22 July 2020,"Jesus, this I will tell you this and forever greatest TV show in the decades of shows best unbelievably a film masterpiece Vince Gilligan may not be criminal mastermind but he is a Writing Lord , Hate to be the person who was acting during Bryan Cranston age of times because he won the outstanding lead actor in a drama series 4 times like I mean he deserved it he brang Walter White and Hesinberg to life I felt these characters and let's not forget Aaron Paul outstanding actor who should have a leading role in a future show because he is just brilliant at acting every single he felt down I felt his pain like I was feeling it too that shows brilliant acting skills.

Breaking Bad is just unbelievable the duo between Walter White and Jesse Pinkman is unreal they felt to me like they were brothers honestly.

I just have to say this show deserves a 10/10 and 100% rotten tomatoes Thank you."
10.0,18 October 2020,Breaking Bad is the best web series I have ever watched
10.0,25 January 2022,"Ohh man!

How a tv drama series can be so touchy!

Even after almost 4year this drama series's plot character music dialogue still runs through my veins."
10.0,22 June 2015,"This serial has been Bad example for the others so that they should improve themselves to reach the new standards set by legendary serial BB.

it would be great to see whole cast (except death ones) in new serial ""Better Call Saul"" where they can extend the story.

in my opinion, Serial shows what will happen when ordinary people face serious health problems if they don't have enough financial source to afford the cost. People will better die instead of making a big hole in their family budget. Economical problems will lead people to Break Bad where they only can find temporary solutions with no happy end."
10.0,20 January 2023,"The story of a chemistry teacher that becomes a drug kingpin. I can't imagine I'll ever watch anything again that will match this show or anything or anything that I will enjoy as much. The artistic cinematography, the characters, the plot, the action, the drama, the comedy and the character development are all 10/10. Great moments of comedy, drama and suspense. It's gripping and addictive, a must watch for anyone and it only gets better with each season. After finishing the show I was left speechless, it's just absolute perfection and the ending couldn't have been any better. It really has set the bar of the best show I've ever watched and Vince Gilligan is a genius."

10.0,5 August 2018,"At the end of season 4 you'll feel ""wow that's amazing, best, etc."" . But at the end of 5th season u will cry, regret. Cuz in Breaking bad you'll feel like living the series. They show every little detail in the show which makes us more attached, you miss nothing. Best ending with the intention to make audience heartbroken. Well done!"
10.0,20 February 2023,"I love this so much i honestly don't know how i can condense everything i love about this show in one sitting.

So here's my top 3

1. The characters Even if i hate a character (like Skyler or Marie), I can still understand them and empathize with them on a personal level. Even when it come to my favorite characters (like Jesse and Mike), I can still find flaws in them that make them realistic and interesting. For example, Walter is incredibly smart, but he's smart in a way that i don't see often in movies and shows. Where smart characters are usually over-exaggerated and are therefore painful to sit through. The actors clearly put work and effort into making believable and enjoyable characters. Specifically the character of Jesse. His mannerisms and overall personality was clearly crafted to be consistent.

2. The plot Is there anything I even have to say? This plot is honestly a work of genius.

3. The memes Iconic.

This fricking (i can't put naughty words on here) show I love it so much I can't even put it into words #jessepinkmancansteponme."
10.0,20 June 2018,"This show started off really good. Was slow at times, especially seasons 2,3,4 and early into season 5. But the ending? Incredible. Amazing. Extraordinary. GENIOUS. So worth the wait. Thank you. Would give it a 9.7 but it didn't let me do that :("
10.0,9 January 2020,"Some moments just amaze, some sad some excite. It was a beautiful story.

Buuut, it felt like creators tried to fill it with senseless things sometimes so to make it longer and add extra hours. Just for business. that's why 9/10"
10.0,30 October 2018,"Everything is just perfect! The acting, the music, the script, the director everything"
10.0,7 March 2020,"Can't find a word to describe my excitement after watching this series; those characters really go into my heart, and I already bought a T-shirt painted ""Heisenberg""!"
9.0,23 September 2021,Season 1: 7/10 Season 2: 8/10 Season 3: 9.5/10 Season 4/5: 10 Season 1 didn't really grab me all that much but it was well worth sticking through it just based off the peaks.
10.0,27 June 2022,"I started watching breaking bad whilst in university. My friends told me how great it was for years and I didn't really care to watch (and I watch a lot of TV shows). After the first 2 episodes I was hooked. The relationship between Walt and Jesse is unmatchable, the introduction of the other characters and the role they play such as Gustavo keeps the series interesting and exciting, the constant plot twists and action, even Walt and Skyler's marriage is just so damn funny. The storyline, the writing, the drama, the action, the way this programme has you glued to your seat is like nothing else. I nearly failed my degree as I watched the entire series in 3 weeks and flunked my exam due to spending too much time on breaking bad but it was worth it. Since watching I've tried to enjoy other programmes and don't get me wrong there is many fantastic TV programmes but everytime I finish another I just sit back and say to myself ""wasn't as good as breaking bad though"".. It has ruined TV for me but do I regret it? Absolutely not. Greatest TV series ever to exist and I don't think anything will beat it. If you haven't already, sit down and watch it immediately, you will not be disappointed!"
9.0,9 March 2019,This is by far my favorite series... Everything is perfect. WATCH IT.
10.0,13 March 2018,Best show that was ever created and will ever be created!
10.0,19 July 2020,"So I completed all the 5 seasons of breaking Bad The story and concept are fabulous I like the characters which they choose for breaking Bad web series The season 5 Episode 5 is outstanding completely. They robbed the moving train The idea they made is ultimate.. The director choose really great characters to this like Walter White , Jessy Pinkman and etc... Finally there is nothing to say about it... this is one of the best no no the best"
8.0,21 July 2020,
10.0,30 March 2023,"Bryan Cranson and Aaron Paul deliver on this legendary series that will go down in history as one of the best. It's the perfect anti-hero story - a science teacher who finds out he has lung cancer and inadvertently finds a way to make drugs that can earn him some faster cash to live his final years the way he wants to. But naturally, this is a dark path that leads him into some dark choices. The twists, turns, dark comedy and ultimate tragedies will keep you captivated and wanting to binge this entire series in one sitting. There isn't a single dull moment in this series and you'll often find yourself laughing and shocked within the same episode."

9.0,15 February 2015,"well where do i begin , this show is not just another television show its the most awesome thing a person could ever encounter . its fiction everyone knows that but still its like the most real thing i've ever seen. the acting , the story , the direction , the dialogs ,everything is out of this world . And at top of all these things Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul had portrayed there characters fantastically . i mean i can't imagine anyone else to act the way these two did. Its the thing that is gonna be remembered for centuries. i don't know about any of you people but this show has made a major impact in my life .And for those who like watching TV series haven't seen this one are missing the best experience of TV."
10.0,1 July 2022,"I'm an avid anime watcher and this was my first TV series and I was left stunned after I finished watching this. From the outstanding plot twists to the abyss like depth in all of the characters, from the dialogues to the cinematography, not a moment was dull in Breaking Bad. I was left awe-struck in the journey of Walter White who metamorphosed into Heisenberg and was left speechless with nothing but praises for this masterpiece of a show. Just indulge yourself in this ride of 62 episodes of this rollercoaster which would be the time of your life and you'll remember this show till you take your last breath in your death bed, yeah, it's that good. You'll go around telling people ""What's my name?"" and the stans of this show would say ""Heisenberg"" and you'll scream out ""YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT"". Heisenberg is not a character but an emotion and we all love him deep down. Probably, the best grey character in all of fiction perfect embodiment of yin and yang."

10.0,18 November 2014,"It is impossible to think of every adjective to describe the epic story that is Breaking Bad. The show from beginning to end is probably one of the most incredible rides in the history of television.

This series doesn't just dive into the drug trade and the criminal underworld that cooking crystal meth delivers, this show also dives into the lives of each character and makes you see the moral complexity of each and every character in the show.

So why is it that I also said it is one of the worst series of all time too? Well it's pretty simple really. Once you see this show from beginning to end, you will be amazed... better yet so astounded, that you may not be able to watch ANY other show on TV because of it. No matter what you do, or what you say to yourself, you will almost always compare every other TV show to Breaking Bad and find that you will not find anything as incredible as this show is. The show is that amazing. I only watch Game of Thrones, True Detective, and Sons of Anarchy now because of it, and they still pale in comparison to this show.

And in fact, upon another binge worthy viewing of the show, it may actually be better the 2nd time around since you can actually see the changes that each person goes through without wondering what will happen next. I keep saying it to anyone that I'm friends with and others as well, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching this amazing piece of art that truly will stand the test of time."
10.0,15 March 2018,"This the one and only TV show that makes me nervous even reviewing it cause of my lack of ability to describe it properly. It's a show where almost every season, every episode is monumental. The pacing is somewhat slow at some point, but it is nothing to worry about. It is easily overshadowed by its epic moments throughout the entire series. This is a show that leaves me hanging, hangover, having that void of a feeling when it ends and it lasts for quite a long time. Vince Gilligan is a name that's hard for me to forget, and I often forget names. Easily one of my favorite shows of all time with a perfectly crafted ending.

The only show of all movies/shows I've ever given 10/10."
10.0,12 May 2018,"The show starts slow but keeps getting better every season, the story, acting and direction is so amazing that no episode in any season was a dull. The show keeps you hooked it is made for binge watching !!"

9.0,25 July 2023,"Breaking Bad. Where do I start with this masterpiece? This action-packed, beautifully written, incredibly shot, work of art known as Breaking Bad is the most beautiful, most incredible, most excellent show someone could ever hope to watch. It's expert written creates unbelievable tension that will grip you. This is a tale of love, betrayal and change that deserves the hype and awards. It has the greatest story, character arks, cinematography, characters, writing and more of any television show ever! The only other competitor is Better Call Saul(the prequel) which is also unbelievably excellent and is worth a watch after this. Some may find both of them boring for the first season or two but when you get to season 3,4,5 it becomes even more incredible! 30/10."
10.0,4 March 2020,
9.0,29 September 2020,"The. Best. TV. Show. Ever.

It's been 5+ years since I watched the masterfully put together finale of Breaking Bad. The fact I'm writing this now shows the profound impact it's had on me.

It's very rare for a series to nail everything - casting, acting, writing, directing, plot and character development, entertainment value and the all-important - knowing when it's time to end and doing it in style. Breaking Bad does this like none has ever done before it and will likely ever do again.

It's said the writers wrote the ending first and then worked backwards, and it shows.

Everything that happens in the four series leading into the final series (and the final episode) was perfectly put together to enable this masterpiece to finish with the crescendo it deserved.

It's only after you've been punched in the guts by the final episode that it becomes clear that everything you've been watching for the past 5 years was done for this very moment - the last perfectly shot and acted last 10 minutes of the finale.

Watching the last episode was at the same time satisfying and yet there was an empty feeling straight after knowing Walter White would no longer be in my life.

Breaking Bad has set the gold standard for TV series. It's like watching 62 hour long feature films which you never want to end. It's the Mona Lisa of TV - it will never grow old and the more you look at it the more complex and beautiful it becomes, while still being something which on face value looks so simple.

If I could give the 1 billion stars I would - but IMDB only lets you give it 10, which just doesn't represent the masterpiece it is, and will always be."

10.0,19 January 2022,"My favourite video film is ""Titanic"". It tells the story of a famous ship, the ""Titanic"", which sank in 1912. The ""Titanic"" was a colossal ship even by modern standards. Its tragic sinking will always be remembered, for the ship went down on the first voyage with heavy losses. The director of the film is James Cameron. The main parts in the film are played by young actors Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet. To my mind their acting is superb. The camerawork is fantastic, too. I've heard that they made a full-size model of the ""Titanic"" for this film. It's a very spectacular film. It is also a moving love-story. I advise all my friends to see ""Titanic"". The film was awarded 11 Oscars and I'm sure it deserves every one of them."

10.0,7 December 2018,"... just give the man some cancer bro! Jokes aside, this series is a really great show. It's a great cat and mouse spiel between WW and the FBI uncle. While some villains are a bit over-acted and stereotypical, they do play an integral part in forcing Walter White to evolve into the badass he is towards the end of the series. And one is quite torn between sympathizing with the protagonist and hating him for his lack of humanity. But it's not necessary to 100% like a protagonist for a show to be good. After all, character development is what makes a show interesting and BB clearly is a great example in this regard. The camera and the plot are done very professionally and most actors deliver a great performance.

Pro Tip: Skip the Skyler episodes. If you're not into family drama, they can be rather boring."
10.0,9 September 2021,"Yesterday I completed watching this series and I'm literally astonished till now I've never seen this kind of a ending in any series, movie or even in tv shows,the only negative point I found out from this series is the slow pace of first 2seasons, cinematography and picture quality, if you're fan of amazing cinematography and don't have patience to go forward over and over then you'll surely leave this series in the first season most likely."

9.0,5 December 2020,"An excellent series in all respects. Starting from camera work, and ending with design, competent color correction, a well-thought-out plot, well-chosen actors. This is a wonderful quintessence of drama and action in one bottle. Drama is like a story of the life of all heroes. Everyone has fate, everyone has their own troubles. Action - The basis of the whole action, when the hero must make the right decision and only thanks to this, he will be able to save both himself and his family as a whole, as well as leave alive or destroy the traitors. This is my first series on which I once got hooked, spent about 2.5 months watching. Now for me 5 seasons is nothing at all, but initially when I started watching ""Breaking Bad"", I felt a really gorgeous picture of the series itself. When you sit and enjoy everything that happens, you literally get into the whole plot component, you begin to understand who and what he is, who is a traitor and who can help Walter. This is a gorgeous series who would not say anything! Would review it again."

10.0,10 October 2021,"Very exciting series with all kind of suspense, action, comedy, Suspense etc. Last few seasons are too slow moving and I just watched skipping some scenes. Overall great story."
10.0,25 July 2018,"I had to admit, when I watched the first few episodes of ""Breaking Bad"" I was quite unsure of what I thought because the characters appeared to be very predictable and the story wasn't immediately that interesting. I just took it to be a saccharine drama involving a man who ends up selling drugs with his younger stereotypically ""comic relief"" stooge.

HOWEVER, as the story develops it completely reversed the initial view that I had of it. I found it very gripping, completely unpredictable, moving and, generally, it is unlike anything I have seen from this kind of genre. Nothing feels forced or overdone. I think this is because the series starts off in ordinary surroundings and in a typical environment. Every character has a real depth to them, which shows how much thought has been given to the detail of the overall series and the direction it will take. Once you start watching you are very unlikely to be able to stop watching! If you're watching with anyone you will be both be heatedly debating what will happen."
10.0,24 May 2018,"This is the most captivating, interesting, chilling series that has ever been created. It's almost a pitiful to watch it because once you do nothing ever comes close. If I could rate it a 20/10 I would a million times over. I love everything about this series from the location to every cast member and else thing else in between."
9.0,11 May 2018,"All time greatest series.

What an awesome change of pace for Bryan Cranston, who is best known for playing the goofy dimwitted Homer Simpson like dad from Malcom In The Middle(2000-2006). But this character is not goofy or dimwitted. Walter White is your everyday man, who is a high school chemistry teacher, and has a loving wife and handicapped son. On the verge of his 50th birthday party. He begins having a mid life crisis, to make matters worse, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. But not wanting to leave his family with nothing, in a quick way to make a lot of money. He teams up with a former student named Pinkmam(Aaron Paul) who is now a drug dealer, to make the drug called Crystal Meth. You don't like what Walter is doing, but at the same time you try to understand why he is doing it. I like watching the transformation he is going through, like Mr.Chips turning into Michael Douglas from Falling Down(1993). This series is quite enjoyable, it's a good dramatic series, with some humor moments. Cranstons performance in the show is memorable, and at times heartbreaken to watch. And he and Aaron Paul play off each other so well. I hope it will last a little while."

10.0,25 August 2019,"Well, this review will not tell you anything new as far as a summary of events, or anything that isn't popular opinion. Most shifting through these probably seen it all anyways. To the rare few who havent. This has to be the greatest show ever created. From the start the show flexed its muscles on engaging story and Incredible acting. The twist of events that happen and how walt managing to keep the train rolling. Amazing talents of acting such as crawl space. The writing and story so engaging. Being able to blend comedy into serious situations without taking away from the gravity of the moment is unmatched and always timed correctly. Theres a reason this is ranked 5th highest on imdb. (Although , not sure how itz below some with less rating and less votes). The legacy of this show brought us better call saul and now the movie. In their reunion it was brought up as the greatest show ever. And modestly Bryan Cranston said it's for people to decide. Jonathan Banks interrupted and said it is. Which I got to say I agree."

10.0,13 May 2018,"This is without a doubt the best TV drama I have ever seen. I have now watched this show three times, and I am sure I will watch it many more. The plot is the so incredibly interesting and entertaining, filled with characters so well constructed, and dialogue that can be heartbreaking but also darkly funny. I would recommend to everyone, but I would also recommend watching it again even if you've seen it. This is because, even though there are many dramatic and exhilarating moments throughout, it is quite something to look at this series as a whole and see how it all comes together in the end. It is so clever and so well thought out, which is missing in so many otherwise good series on tv today. The acting is so incredible. Aaron Paul gives an outstanding performance as Jesse, and enables you to sympathise with and love a character who usually you wouldn't. What is most amazing is the detail put into the growth and evolution of Walter White. It astounds me how you can initially feel sorry for and be worried for a character, but there are points later on in the show where you actually despise that same character. I haven't seen anything like it, and I doubt I ever will again!"

10.0,29 October 2014,"I will admit when I was first introduced to this show I did not think I could get into it but when you give it a shot and watch through the whole first 3 episodes your hooked onwards to see the roller coaster ride that unfolds for Mr. Walter White. Many times throughout the show you ""think"" you know what's about to happen but things take a split second turn. I was satisfied with the ending but would have been more stoked to see how one other character that drives away ended up. I wont give away who it is but it would have been gratifying to see how his life turned out since we saw how his partner ended up. Or at least have seen what was next for him. Either way the best show I have seen in my life. It's basically an extremely long movie thats about the best way to put it."
10.0,19 September 2018,Have you just completed watching this and came over imdb to rate it other than 10? Well i suggest you to go back and rewatch every single episode over again and come back! Still not convinced? Well then you have to watch this over an infinite loop until you feel this deserves a 10 cus this must be given a 10 and if not you havent watched this good enough

10.0,5 March 2023,"Breaking Bad is a show that starts off slow. However, it gets faster and better as the seasons progressed. The characters in the show were very well-written. The plot started slow but quickly took off. It was a very unpredictable show, and I loved the surprises around every corner that the show had to offer. Everyone had their acting moments, and the soundtrack was really good as well. Season 2 is when the plot starts to progress with the characters in the series. The end of Season 3 was a bit slow, but the ending of Season 4 was amazing. However, the best part of the show were the final 3 episodes. Ozymandias, Granite State, and Felina all were absolutely amazing episodes that wrapped up the show brilliantly. Easily one of the best cinematography creations of all time."
9.0,23 December 2017,"Started really slow, but then evolved to be one of the best TV shows ever made."
10.0,3 January 2020,"If you have seen even some of episodes of the show , it's highly unlikely you'll argue with me. W.W(Eisenberg) is the highlight of the show. He is a underdog who overcome s everything thrown at him and yet able to keep you on your toes everytime you see him. Jesse is phenomenal too."
10.0,6 May 2014,"This series is the best i've ever seen. I watched many series like walking dead,game of thrones,sopranos,the wire but Breaking Bad is the Number one.

The funny thing about Breaking Bad is that when you urge people to watch it, and describe the basic idea of the show, they think it all sounds a bit ridiculous. Well, hands up, so did we when it was explained to us. To anyone out there who has these doubts - put them from your mind! This is, without doubt one of the finest pieces of drama ever made. There is not a weak performance from any of the actors, and the consistent quality of the storyline is maintained through all 5 series. I would go as far as to say that Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White (mild-mannered chemistry teacher gone bad) is bordering on genius.

The first and second season was a kind of boring(in action), but there are so many good conversations. And the actors are so good. I really loved the show and i was really surprised at the end. Watch out for spoilers in the internet, there many dump people..

10.0,8 September 2023,"*taking a deep breath and slowly exhaling *

So a few years back I was, much like today, a really enthusiastic fan of music and cinema and stuff like that, and much like today I was up and ready to talk with just about every single person who was ready to listen about my favorite albums, TV shows and stuff. Yeah, the spirit of the reviewer has been in my heart for quite some time now. I was much less broad when it came to the genres I consumed, I didn't try to analyze things as thoroughly as I do today, and I'd say that I generally took less time with each experience I had in that regard. Indeed, these were different times, and I was a fairly different person in some senses.

That was the time when Breaking Bad had entered into my life, and boy oh boy, was my mind absolutely blown to pieces. For years I used to tell people that it was the best TV show I've ever seen, and I really can't overstate the impact that it had on me in the time. It was an emotional rollercoaster, and even though, like I said earlier, I wasn't much of a deep-dive guy when it came to TV shows, the experience was so amazing that I truly wasn't feeling like I was missing on anything.

Fast forward. I'm starting out to review stuff online, and I come upon this YouTube channel called The Take, which has some really solid film analysis content. After a while I discover their Breaking Bad analysis series of videos, and something about it just opened my eyes. There was one video and particular, regarding father-son relationship and some religious symbolism, that really hit hard for me, and yes: I cried while watching an analysis video of a TV show I've seen several years ago, and I guess that with all the hype around Better Call Saul it was enough for me - I wanted to re-experience Breaking Bad. I wanted it as a preparation for Better Call Saul, I wanted it so I could review it and share my opinion with y'all because that's what I do, here in my tiny platform, and most of all I guess that I just wanted to try and re-experience this series, now that I've seen more stuff and feel like I have a deeper understanding when it comes to these matters.

Alright, then. Breaking Bad. Let's do this.

Breaking Bad follows this high-school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston), who lives his gray and ordinary life in the shadow of all the opportunities he has missed in his life. After he gets a lung cancer diagnosis, and influenced by an idea that was sparked in him during an interaction with his DEA agent brother-in-law, Hank, Walter decides to start cooking and selling meth, so his family will be financially stable even after he dies. In order to achieve that goal, he reaches out to Jessie Pinkman (Aaron Paul), a former student of his, now a drug dealer, with a partnership offer. What could possibly go wrong?

The most common complaint I've heard about this series from people is that the pacing is way too slow, and that it takes ages until something even remotely interesting happens. To that I say: guys, you trippin', Sorry not sorry. Alright, yeah, some chunks of the series have a slow-burn type of thing going on, but come on: things are really intense and explosive even from the get-go, and I feel like there's always something interesting that's happening on screen. I just can't see how one might start season one and think it slow or boring, but you do you. And you know, even beyond that: some sections of this series were so intense and immerse for me, that even in rewatch I was on the edge of my seat. I would say that it speaks to the power of the plot here.

The second thing that I'd like to praise is the casting here. The cast is absolutely PERFECT, all caps. Each actor and actress feel like the role was tailored just for their size, and I feel like you could literally look at any random character on the show, pause for a second and then realize just how they embody their character in a flawless way. Not just the main characters, too. You'll get what I mean when you watch it, but yeah, it's amazing.

When it comes to the themes that are explored in the series, I find the dive into festering emotions that just eat you from the inside really interesting, and also the exploration of toxic masculinity in many shapes and forms. Walt also goes through a major metamorphosis throughout the series, and I don't wanna spoil anything but I'll just say that the shift is so slow and well-crafted and it feels very, very real, and it's probably the thing that makes Walter White one of the roundest characters I've ever came across. By the way, changes that characters go through in this series in general, like, not only Walt, are always really slow and meticulous. One event here that changes them slightly, one event there that does something in the same direction, and slowly but surely things shift in a very effective way.

Cinematography-wise I think that every episode is at the very least well-directed, even though different directors have worked with Vince Gilligan throughout the show, so it's pretty understandable that there are some episodes that are better directed than others. The dialogues differ sometimes in their level, but most of the time the dialogue is, again, at least very solid, and most episodes have several highlights when it comes to the dialogue. One thing I can pinpoint that I always find brilliant in Breaking Bad, even though it might sound a little funny, is the montages. They are always so satisfying, used to propel the plot in a very fluid way and have something extra memorable about them. Cheff kiss, every single time. Like, wow. Music choice, editing, pacing - it's always on frickin' point.

It's worth mentioning that the series has really effective villains, and I won't get into details so to avoid spoilers, but trust me there. Great bad guys for a great story.

One last thing: even though I was indeed immersed in the series to an extent, and I'd definitely say that it was pretty great rewatching this show, Breaking Bad doesn't have an insane amount of rewatch value imo. No rewatch will be better than the first time with this one, probably, and that's why I'd definitely recommend letting yourself fall into it completely when watching for the first time. I hope that Better Call Saul will really make Vince Gilligan's strength as a storyteller fully shine again for me.

So even though there are some parts here that could have maybe been better paced, and despite the first time watching being stronger than my rewatch, there are so many great things in this series. There's so much attention to detail, impactful writing whether we're talking about main characters or side character, a plot with twists and turns that can be extremely intense, and a deep-dive into toxic masculinity and festering emotion. If you can manage more bloody and drug-related stories, watch it. Definitely one of the best shows I've ever seen. Feeling a 9.2/10 on this one."
10.0,4 April 2020,"This serie can't be described, in other words you have to watch it to understand its greatness. Dramatically shivering stressful scenes that make your heart rate rise, a dramatic perfecly directed serie that is perfect in all the ways possible you can't,litteraly cannot possibly imagine a better scenario. this series did NOTHING wrong director-wise ; actor-wise ; scenario-wise EVERYTHING!!!

I really admire the drama spirit in the scenario especially in episode 14 season 5."
10.0,15 December 2018,This series is slightly better then GOT in many aspects one of which is it have less character and the story is Based upon a Single Character and a chain is being followed here and if you talk About GOT they have one bit in westeros and the mext bit in winterfell so you miss somethings if you loose a slight concentration but in case of Breaking Bad you never muss anything at all. I have a confession too they have one episode where he was just catching a fly which was boring. I hope this review will help you and watch Breaking Bad if you have not watched it yet.
10.0,30 March 2018,"I have seen more than 2500 movies-series in my life, i have some favorites performances from great actors in classic movies.With breaking bad I had one of the greatest experience in my life with Bryan Cranston's Performance as Walter White, I can't forget how good he was in Breaking Bad, i cant erase many scenes from this series from my mind. This performance is definitely one of my 10 favorites and one of the best of all time. i like to thank mr. Cranston because he is a great actor.

the series are really great, very good scenario and nice performance from the other actors i like the direction and the photography

great character Devolopment nice dialogs very good plot"

10.0,7 May 2023,"The best series on netflix! Walter White played by Bryan Cranston one truely great actor able to give life to his characters. Gillian is great as the writer and director. I love the tongue and cheek satire. The cinematography is amazing the colors and the desert landscape is yummy eye candy. The dynamic between Walter and Jessie is an almost infectious son and dad drama. They bounce of each other's sardonic criticism with gleeful exhiliation. A very entertaining drama full of colorful characters . Walt's family is dysfunctional and continues to spiral down the more Walt develops and grows a pair and becomes Hisenberg, the biggest meth producer in New Mexico."

Nice acting by all of them .

Walter and Jesse are awesome duo .

Somehow I felt bored on seeing Mike and Hank . Mr White did not deserve to die by anyone bullet but himself .

Education matters ."
10.0,1 October 2019,Absolute TV Perfection. Believe the hype. Watch it and get hooked like Walters clients. Peace
8.0,13 December 2018,"In my opinion this is quite simply the best non-Sci-Fi drama series of all time. It starts off pretty slow in the first and second season, but by the third and fourth you can't stop watching. I watched the entire series in the week between a Christmas and New Year on an AMC marathon.

In addition to impeccable writing, direction, and acting, it is actually very realistic unlike all those CSI-type shows. The drugs and drug-prohibition businesses both work exactly like this in reality, and other than a few simple substitutions (it's actually quite easy to obtain methylamine in bulk; pseudoephedrine and P2P are the chemicals that are very difficult to obtain in large quantities), the science is on point as well. It's also the most accurate portrayal of the behavior of meth addicts I've ever seen in fiction."

10.0,16 February 2023,"Breaking bad is without a doubt one of the best series known inside of the drugs/cartel scene.

Some things aren't really that realistic but some other parts definitely are.

The Walter White character is very relatable in a lot of ways and there are a lot of emotions that come in to play for myself and for the characters on screen.

The cinematography is also worth mentioning, as it captures the desolate landscape of New Mexico in a way that adds to the overall mood and tone of the show.

For anyone who enjoys well-crafted storytelling, great acting, and a gritty, realistic portrayal of the criminal underworld. It is a true masterpiece of television that will stick with you long after you've finished watching."

10.0,23 January 2020,I started to watch it because of a peer pressure. In the beginning I was kind of regretting because it was too slow and boring but when the passed it got more and more interesting. The last season is the best season of breaking bad. How genius Walter White was!!! That how a simple school teacher ended up . The ending is really very sad . Honestly Breaking Bad now comes on 3rd rank after GOT and Money Heist . I really wanted to give full rating but because of it's slow ending and some boring episode I had to give 9. Thank you Breaking Bad
9.0,5 August 2018,This is by far the best tv series by a country mile. Writing is one of a kind and so is acting. It deserves all the accolades.

10.0,25 April 2014,"You're literally on the edge of your seat throughout the ENTIRE 5 seasons. I watched the whole series in just 3 weeks because it was so addictive. The whole thing is very interesting. Have you ever heard of a story like this before assuming you've read what it is about. A normal boring middle-aged high school teacher who breaks bad into crazy chemical genius? It gets harder and harder to sympathize with Walt as the series continues but you just can't help but like Walt?!?!? I think it's the thrill of watching it and thinking what if I could do it because we relate with the character in so many ways yet we would never do it. JESSE PINKMAN, thank the lord Vince didn't kill him off because just watch and see Aaron Paul's phenomenal acting.

Overall, wow. just wow. The entire series is just a piece of television greatness and I'm sure it will be up in the likes of the twilight zone in many years to come.

It will be the best TV show you have ever watched."

The cast is selected at the highest level!

The whole series was watched in one breath, the plot is super!

I advise everyone to watch, and it doesn't matter what genre of films you like! There is everything here: good humor, a touching drama, an interesting detective story, a crime that is relevant in our time, a thriller that keeps in suspense.

If you plunge into the life of Mr. White, you will definitely not regret it!

No wonder this series has won a lot of awards!"
10.0,9 April 2020,Amazing series recommended. It wasn't the best start though

10.0,25 July 2023,"Everything in this series is exellent. Dialoge and the tension all characters have between eachother, very complex characters and great character development (best example IMO being Jessie), plot being almost too realistic, very detailed and complex, and scientific accuracy are rarely seen together in one series, but here it is.

I love how it can compleatly get you to come with one concluson and later prove you wrong in a well explained way.

I won't even get into the tehnical part (like the scenography or camera work).

It deserves it's title for the best series and I won't even debate about that. Watch it and you will know."
10.0,9 September 2018,"I have learned to like this series. Put the first season and a few plots aside and it is a ""must-watch"" show. Season 1 with the whole corpse dinsingrated in the bathtub, the bathtub falling, the fulminated mercury explosion, were just among those things that pissed me off. But I liked Jesse Pinkman, who was suppposed to die, and became the sidekick instead. It took the usual five season to expand the lead character but it is worth it. Some plots are unbelievable (how are they sill alive ?) but if you go with the flow, just like with season one, it is pretty enjoyable. You will care for Pinkman (Aaron Paul), you will watch the good teacher on his highway to hell. I hated him with passion season 1, then just despised him. The whole point is to make him despicable by showing his true self."

'Better Call Saul' prequel series goes hand in hand with it. You need to watch both. My partner doesn't agree, but I loved it even more than Breaking Bad!"

9.0,25 December 2017,"2 words into the review and I didn't know what to say, I am really astonished by this series. It has everything, great actors, brilliant plot, the idea in itself was so simple yet created such epitome of perfection. 5 Seasons, they are, but you won't feel it, you will get addicted to it.

Breaking Bad is simply a phenomenon that won't re-occur, because in its ingenuity, it is so unique. It's so genius, comedic when necessary. There is Action, Drama, Humor, Joy, Melancholy, plot-twists, cliff-hangers and everything.

It feels so unfaked, the way it's all set up, it feels like a real story, no place for supernatural events. You will see yourself as part of the series.

Breaking Bad cannot be judged by one or two episodes, it's a puzzle of 62 episodes, won't unravel 'til gathered.

I recommend this to everyone, and I mean, everyone.

10/10"
10.0,12 December 2018,Literally one of the greatest shows I've ever seen in my life. No one could bring that character to life the way Cranston did and Paul was phenomenal. Pffft. Vince Gilligan?? Evil genius. Better Call Saul is great too
10.0,4 June 2018,Best show ever period. This show is too good goddamn!
10.0,16 November 2014,"Breaking Bad is one of the best TV shows to ever air in history. Now for me, this is the best TV show I have ever seen. Just seeing this guy go from being all nerdy and timid to this tough and self absorbed man is truly incredible. I have to give it up for Bryan Cranston. He is one of the best actors living right now. He was born to act. I mean his face just has so much emotion in it. Most actors have to try and get the right facial expressions to play that character right. But Bryan's face can make a wide range of expressions without even having to do much. And oh my goodness... Aaron Paul... When I first saw this show, he didn't seem like such a good actor. To me at least he didn't. But as the show goes on, his acting becomes phenomenal! Like when he gets mad in the show, it makes you think that he's in full rage in real life. It's truly amazing. Everyone did an amazing job on Breaking Bad. Every single character in the entire show was incredible. Breaking Bad is the gold standard of television."

10.0,24 February 2019,"No review is gonna do it justice. I first watched it in the later years of airing, getting a hype that made it really addicting. After the series ended, I didn't want to lose that sensation and ended up listening to that Gnarls Barkley's song again and again until I got tired. For a long time, I wanted to watch again. This 2019, I finally watched it again and all I'll say is I got a different experience mostly. The series is full of so many details that I sense I'm gonna watch it a third time after another 5-7 years or so, maybe 10."
9.0,27 January 2017,
10.0,31 December 2017,"This is the best storytelling of all time. hands down. the writers of this series put on a clinic on how to tell a story.

i understand that there is a mystery as to what good storytelling actually is. but the bottom line is this: a story must be rich with irony. this is what makes breaking bad so good. a high school chemistry teacher cooking meth. after getting diagnosed with cancer, he pursues this goal to provide for his family after he dies. meanwhile, his brother-in-law is a DEA agent who pursues drug traffickers such as himself. all of this is extremely ironic and it plays across the whole series.

i've never seen such good storytelling from any other TV series. some movies come close. but nothing really touches the scope of breaking bad. the character arc of walter white. watching him transform from a meek man to a murderous, vengeful drug kingpin is fascinating. jesse pinkman is also a revelation. he is the most tragic character in this story. his inner conflict is heartbreaking.

nothing comes close to this TV series. the sopranos is a joke compared to breaking bad. with time, TV and film historians will look back and agree that breaking bad is the best television series to ever be made. that's guaranteed. walter white is the best protagonist to be ever portrayed on the big screen. other television series like Lost, The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, and others have shown flashes of brilliance .. they've even had many seasons in a row that were brilliant. however, they fell apart at one point or another. Lost really dropped the ball at the end of their series. however, breaking bad maintains an incredible quality throughout. the ending is like no other. ironic. palpable. captivating. one of my favorite episodes is the 2nd to last episode of the series. i'll never forget the closing scene of the 2nd to last episode.

just wow."
10.0,16 May 2019,"He is the Danger and he is knocking...

10.0,23 February 2017,"Im Stunned with this show so much so i kept thinking of the event a lot of time after i have watched it on Netflix,so much so that I ran three or four episodes at on session. I admired and sympathized with Bryan Cranston to the very end for his genius and loyalty to Aaron Paul in the last episode,(both are the major players),for pegging and offering the 80 million dollars to the gang and save the DEA agent Dean Norris(Hank Shrader,his relative) ,almost cried for seeing the moments of death of the beautiful Krysten Ritter(Jane Margolis) so young because of overdose.62 episodes of criminal drama leads viewers to believe that crime in general and drug business is really futile. I would love to see RJ Mitte in real life because he perfected his role as a teenager with cerebral palsy . In short this is a real work of art."
10.0,23 November 2023,"Gustavo caring about those small street dealers using the kid didn't make sense in the sequel, and it messed up the whole story. It's like the creators forgot what they were doing. This confusing part makes it hard to enjoy the movie because it feels like something important is missing. It's like they didn't think about how things should fit together, and that makes the audience wonder why Gustavo is an even carting about small change ""associates"". This mistake takes away from the fun of the story, leaving people scratching their heads about what the creators were thinking. I just didn't get that part. Lack of creatively thinking it through..."

Walter White, the most brilliant man ever who came across such a situation in his life, was never recognized but he came really alive before dying. Cautiousness is a very crucial thing presented in this show and it is in life. Gus Fring was also very intelligent man that only Walter White could conquer, and cartel man like Gus Fring.

Initially Mr. White did it for money for his cancer treatment, but he realized that he never did anything, so he continued cooking meth, for his family.

Jesse Pinkman also a great character that struggled to maintain moral in this whole one after another bad thing, and finally his emotions at the end of the show were like too much to take, like all of everything he experienced throughout. How people dispose bodies like literally disappearing and smoking into acid, this shows the extremity of all bad things.

Overall the show's journey turned out to be very good and it was a true experience to witness the brilliance of Walter White and to experience such a great show."
10.0,7 May 2018,My friend recommended it. Actually I don't like violence but it's an exception.
10.0,12 June 2022,It's a super regular serial movie And I liked it. The actors in this movie are awesome and they were great for the first time and I was really excited about this one.
9.0,16 May 2019,"The title of this series is Breaking bad.The genre of this series is a Drama.The country of origin of USA The orginale language english.The Number of seasons is 5. The Number of episodes is 16. Walter White is a chemistry teacher at a high school and lives with his disabled son and pregnant wife in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, everything collapses. He then decided to set up a methamphetamine laboratory to support his family by partnering with one of his former students, Jesse Pinkman, who had become a petty drug dealer. 19/20 I like a series because the stress is present and action."
9.0,9 September 2019,"Usually I don't put enough efforts to write a comment. However this masterpiece needed it all along. Perfect acting, amazing storyline, great get going. Everything about this series is just perfect. I've watched it twice. Can't get enough of this. I gotta say. I'll miss you Heisenberg. Feels like its a part of me"
8.0,24 October 2020,"I didn't watch this for a long time because I thought it wasn't ""my type"" of drama but boy, was I wrong! I was immediately hooked and lucky enough to be able to watch the episodes (and seasons) back-to-back. It was the binge of a lifetime for me! I don't want to go into details for fear that I'd spoil even a minute of this fantastic story so I'll just advise you to WATCH THIS - you won't be sorry!!"
10.0,25 November 2014,
10.0,19 January 2022,"A wonderful series that breaks consciousness and plunges into the world of violence, drugs, into the world that we did not even suspect. An interesting plot and unexpected outcomes, thanks to the authors for the masterpiece!"
10.0,7 July 2018,This show is the best every episode gets better and better
10.0,11 October 2018,"This is a brilliant tv show where ego and pride goes beyond any morality level. The story is so well tell that you almost don't realize the methamorphosis. Bryan Cranston's Walter White is a fascinating caracter. Take it from me now, when you start with this one you just can't get enough."
10.0,28 March 2018,I don't How any of you give Breaking Bad a score of anything less then 10 stars. That is insane. This is literally the greatest TV show of all time. It literally changed TV for the better. Someone explain to me how you rate Breaking Bad an 8 or a 9 or a 9.5 or anything less than a 10? What could have possibly been the difference from being a 10 and a 9 or 8.5? That is insane. This is literally the greatest TV show of all time. It literally changed TV for the better. Shows that came on after Breaking Bad ended compare themselves to Breaking Bad. THE GREATEST SHOW EVER.
10.0,20 October 2019,This is one of the best shows i've watched. I hope there will be more shows like these.
10.0,27 August 2024,"This s a masterful exploration of moral decay, following the transformation of Walter White from a mild-mannered chemistry teacher to a ruthless drug lord. The show is brilliantly crafted, with meticulous attention to detail and a narrative that builds tension to almost unbearable levels. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter is nothing short of iconic, as he brings depth and nuance to a character who is both terrifying and tragic. The supporting cast, especially Aaron Paul as Jesse Pinkman, adds layers of complexity and emotional weight to the story. ""Breaking Bad"" is a slow burn, but it rewards patience with some of the most memorable moments in television history. It's a gripping tale of ambition, power, and the consequences of choices that resonate long after the final episode."

10.0,3 May 2018,"Breaking Bad is one of those rare things that happens such as all the planets of the solar system being in perfect alignment with the sun.

Everything about this show from the writing to the casting is just perfect.

It's the best show by a million miles and i doubt we will see anything as good as it again in this century, If you haven't seen it yet go watch it and if you have seen it go watch it again!"
9.0,26 June 2022,"From my experience as someone who isn't very into watching TV shows and such, this has changed my perception on that. This show has changed me for the better and has had me hooked since the pilot.

There does tend to be scenes that drag on and or is boring but then action happens right after them. When I first saw memes and people talking about Breaking Bad, I made a joke with my friend that we should watch Breaking Bad. I fell in love with the show even though my expectations were very low for the show.

I have yet to see a show that may beat this. After this review I'll watch Better Call Saul and see if I change my view on Breaking Bad being the greatest TV show of all time."
10.0,9 April 2018,"I tell you, the best, you'll not regret watching it"
10.0,9 June 2018,"I've watched the show twice now and am still in awe at what a masterpiece this show is. The first season may start off somewhat slow, however it only gets better and better from there. There is so much development in the show for every character that by the last episode you will almost be watching an entirely different show. I cannot think of a tv show I have ever been so shocked at the level of quality and talent showcased. And without spoiling anything, the series finale has to be the most satisfying episode of any television show ever. The ending was so well done I wouldn't want the show to end any other way."
9.0,21 July 2020,I finished watching in two years in total. I could not finish the first season in three months because i was really bored and could not catch up with the story and which way it was going. Then came the next summer. I watched the show in literally every spare time i got (including the one time i was having a shower) and finished the rest of the seasons in one month. Anyway the series made history and there is not much else to say. Absolutely amazing.
10.0,22 October 2018,Amazing plot and acting for sure. Aaron Paul and a Bryan Cranston killed it and the ending of the show is definitely something else. Gets more intense with every season and shows every well that every action has a reaction. Worth it
10.0,6 April 2018,"First I watched tons of great tv shows, comedy or drama and none had make me feel so many emotions I actually stopped thinking of it as just a show. The characters,camera action, brilliant ideas and mainly Script. The way conversations made me hear more, but in the same time turn off tv, so i dont have to feel that pain and angre...I actually stopped watching after something dead on the bed, wink wink. I started watch again in more than 6 months thinking that one moment that was the longest minute of my TV show expirience cant be out***** . Boy I was wrong and watched last 2 series in two days with look of another victim of that geniously written lines and all around perfection my nightmares see when they having a beutifull dream."

10.0,22 July 2020,If you don't have time do not start this tv series. If you do I promise you that you will binge watch the **** out of it. Everything is good about this show. And by everything I mean everything. There's nothing better than sitting down to watch an episode. I recently watched El Camino which kind of sucked. But hey BB it's really really really reallllllyyyyy good.
10.0,5 March 2020,Very good but it is too long 62 ep very one is 45 minutes too long but it worth every minute
10.0,16 May 2019,"A chemistry teacher is diagnosed with cancer. Because he cannot pay for the treatment with his savings, he has to take a different path. This changes his life, not only his financial situation, but also his personality. The series is always on point right from the start to the end. Just perfect."
10.0,15 October 2018,Breaking Bad Is very very good this review Doesn't contain spoilers
8.0,21 September 2021,
10.0,5 July 2022,"This show is honestly the best show in the world Perfect storyline, Perfect pacing, and a Perfect ending, non of the shows i no had wrapped up so well. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it right now."
9.0,24 November 2019,"Saw it, I think I liked it, just a little bit, not too much"
10.0,23 March 2018,"First off...I do not write a reviews on many things. Only at a time at which I truly feel that compelled to do so will I take the time to write out a review. It was probably 2012 when I had first heard of this show just in passing...it was one of those ""Man you need to watch this show"" type of statement that someone told me. Of course people say these types of things all the time trying to sell other people on good shows to watch so I didn't think anything of it and continued on my merry way.

The day had finally come when I was searching tirelessly on Netflix for something to watch and by this time Netflix had just added the first 4 seasons of BB so I decided to actually sit and watch the pilot episode. Right away after hitting the play button on my remote the show snatched up my brain and grabbed a hold tightly...the creative genious that is Vince Gilligan really put together a picture perfect pilot episode which could really stand along as its own animal. The Cinematography is brilliant, the show's opening title sequence is picture perfect (Not too long, not too short and currently serves as my phone ring tone btw) and just over all feel of the show is very real in tone. You don't feel like you are watching a ""tv show"" but rather experiencing the lives of these people.

So after watching the pilot that was it...I couldn't pry myself away and I then binged the entire 4 seasons up to that point taking breaks only to sleep and eat...Everything about this show is perfect from the pacing, the character development, the acting and the creative attention to detail in the story telling...it is all so perfect and amazing to experience. Bryan Cranston has become my new favorite actor after watching this show...he is so relatable and everyone knows someone like Walter White in their life but he does an absolute amazing job in this role, it is no wonder why he has won so many awards.

What is great about this series and is something rarely seen is how it progressively gets better and better right up until the finale...there are no weak moments or weak episodes, everything has a point and purpose to the story telling and every episode gains momentum from the previous...its like a giant rolling snowball just waiting to hit something. The reason I am writing this now is because for the 3rd time I am re-watching the entire series simply because nothing is out there for me in the form of the same good entertainment I can find. I watched the series for the first time by myself, then I watched it again with my girlfriend a couple years ago, and the just last week I was bored one night going to sleep and thought what the hell I'll just watch the pilot episode again just to fall asleep to...Guess again, just like the previous 2 watches I got hooked again and was up til 3 am watching 4 episodes (That I had already seen 2 times) that is the effect this show has on people... it is as addictive to view as Heisenberg's baby blue Meth is to consume. I find myself with this stupid vindictive grin on my face when I finish watching these episodes even the 3rd time around...I catch new details never seen before.

In conclusion, if you have read this all the way to the end and are in the unfortunate group to have not watched this masterpiece of a show, please reconsider your time over the next couple of weeks and take a seat in front of the flat screen, pull up Netflix and enjoy what is probably going to go down as one of the greatest pieces of television in all history."
10.0,21 February 2015,"I love media and entertainment. Movies and video games tend to be my favorite but one form of media I don't really like nowadays is television. I used to love TV series as a child but growing up I've lost a lot of interest. Despite this I actually thoroughly enjoyed one show, and that show was Breaking Bad. I've always heard about this show from everyone saying how awesome it was, but I never really had any interest until I saw my uncle watching it. I was hooked on just one episode.

The series is all about a chemistry teacher named Walter White who is diagnosed with lung cancer. His future looks bleak but he decides to get treatment for the cancer anyways which would be expensive and probably put his family into debt, so he decides to do something crazy just to support his family. He had two jobs already but being a teacher and car wash worker alone could not do the job. He teams up with the second main character, Jesse Pinkman to synthesize and market methamphetamine. This point is where the series takes off and gets much more interesting. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman turn from zeroes into successful and rich drug lords.

Everything about this show was just fantastic. My favorite aspect of the entire show though had to be the characters. All of the characters, even the minor ones were three dimensional and exciting. I loved this show so much that I even liked to see the characters I didn't like, because they still added something amazing to the story. There was also loads of character development and even character derailment. All of the characters' relationships and interactions made sense and tied together. The main character Walter White, who turned into a monster, I still supported because he was just so well written that I couldn't help but love him no matter what he did. If anyone wants a show with great characters they would really like this show.

Another aspect about this show I like is the theme and dark tone. This show was intended for mature audiences and nothing about this show was sparkly or innocent. I love morbid TV series and everything about this show was morbid. I was on the edge of my seat every episode. It was almost as if I could feel all the suspense and nervousness the characters felt. Usually it's very difficult to pull off dark themes, but Breaking Bad did it with perfection. I do admit though that the first couple of episodes were really hard to watch but it turned out to be worthwhile. Let's just say the whole thing about drugs, murder, sex, families being torn apart, and etc. was pulled off marvelously.

This show just had everything. Although my favorite parts of this show were the characters and tone, I still liked everything else such as the plot, music, visuals, and writing. I don't think I'll find another show that can hook me like this one. If you couldn't already tell I highly recommend this show to all adult viewers who like something edgy. If you don't really like edgy shows try this anyways because it's just that good."
10.0,23 July 2019,"Every episode stuns you. The direction, production, acting skills, and the sound effects are all excellent. Worth a watch. About 60 Episodes, but I wish I had more to watch😀"
9.0,11 May 2018,"Couldn't believe it was better the second time I watched the entire series.

Amazing amazing television.

If you haven't watched you are so lucky. Get stuck in and enjoy."
10.0,13 March 2023,"In this gripping show, the characters are all complex and flawed, and they all make mistakes and sometimes make baffling choices based on their circumstances. The line between ""good"" and ""bad"" is undefined in Breaking Bad; nobody looks particularly likable, including Walt's brusque brother-in-law, Hank (Dean Norris). But Cranston's performance is its best quality. The spacey, clueless dad of Malcolm in the Middle transforms into an iconic anti-hero. In addition to Cranston, Paul, Giancarlo Esposito, and Gunn also shine. Despite amoral characters, the show has tight direction and intelligent writing."
10.0,16 September 2018,The best TV show of all time ! Yeah Mr.White! Yeah Science!
10.0,14 October 2019,"BrBa deserves nothing less than 10/10 hell i give it 11/10 just accept it that BrBa is million times better than GOT ,GOT S08 was epic failure hence,the greatest tv series ever made Hail Heisenberg💗"
10.0,3 January 2018,"It was my first ever series I watched and I didn't excepted to be so perfect.Everything is perfect in this series starting from directing,actors,story,characters.Bryan Cranston in leading role was just legend,he build up his role so good with the help of Aaron Paul making a duo of actors you just cant stop watching.I highly recommend this series you will enjoy them 100%

PS: I already watched it twice..."
10.0,25 January 2020,"Actually I don't love action movies or series.That's why I was avoiding this series again and again, though I was recommende by many to watch it. After watching this TV series, realised I did the right thing. Do you know why? Because I always make sure that the best deserves the last."
10.0,19 January 2022,"What an incredible roller coaster of a ride. Simply, mesmerising, perfection from the first second to the last. All of the actors portrayal of the diverse, yet equally entertaining, characters are utterly superb. I've watched many shows over time but nothing comes, even, close to this magnificent masterpiece. Difficult to imagine that this show will be surpassed; perhaps ever."
10.0,9 June 2018,"All I can say is godlike!

Breaking Bad is one of the best tv-show have I ever seen. And yeah the number one is Breaking Bad. Since 5 years any of the series can't change my mind on number one."
10.0,8 May 2018,This is the best series ever made in every artistic aspect. Is THE masterpiece series.

10.0,26 March 2018,"Best tv show,...worth watching every single moment"
10.0,12 October 2019,"Breaking Bad is no doubt one of the greatest TV series. I was surprised at how hooked I had got to it. It is so addictive that I just could not watch an episode and not watch the next one. With a lineup of incredible actors led by Bryan Cranston, the show is full of intense drama, explosive action, mystery, suspense and a shy bit of gore. It almost feels like a really long movie with a really good ending. Like a lot of shows which rely on plot twists, I don't think Breaking Bad is very re-watchable though you'll definitely be blown away the first time you'll watch it."
10.0,7 August 2018,"The best show to ever hit television. Every scene means something, nothing is wasted in this."
8.0,8 September 2019,U'all guyz who ever took a breath in the world must watch it no spoil no nothing just watch 🔥
10.0,22 April 2014,"Firstly and foremost i'm not going to blabber on with a comparison of other successful television series i.e, GOT, SOA, LOST, DEXTER and the rest of these brilliant projects. This is a series in an entirely different and unique realm of TV.

After hearing through the internet/tabloid grapevine that Bryan Cranston would be taking the lead in a new AMC series it got me very excited and anxious,..anxious with regards to the fact that this fresh series would be conveyed in a ''Black Comedy Drama'' setting, to which I felt intrigued whether Mr Cranston could pull it off? not only does he 'Pull Off' the role of Walter White in this 5 series bonanza, he moulds walter white into one of the biggest on screen marvels of ALL TIME, Bryan Cranston is a truly terrific actor who deserves nothing but praise and commendation for his electrifying performance as the power hungry, ruthless Meth Kingpin...Just for the record his display of Walter White is so good it grabbed the attention of Hollywood legend Sir Anthony Hopkins who personally wrote an email to congratulate Bryan Cranston on his depiction of Walter White.

Obviously the show isn't glorious purely on Cranston's acting ability, huge credits have to be awarded to the brilliant cast namely Aaron Paul Anna Gunn, Dean Norris, RJ Mitte, Betsy Brandt, Bob Odenkirk and many other worthy actors/actresses who brought this series to life.

It would be scandalous of me not to mention the brain behind this project, Vince Gilligan, a insanely talented and imaginative screen writer/producer/director who injected the show with a shot of pure class.

Overall I just can't describe how perfect this series is, there just isn't enough words, even with the 1000 characters I'm allocated for this review.

Bottom Line, just watch it, it will probably be the finest thing you'll ever set your eyes on. It certainly was for me.

Magnificent."
8.0,24 January 2022,Breaking Bad is one of the Titles I've ever watched in my life. Solid storytelling and absolute flawless process until that unbelievable and caotic ending.
9.0,13 May 2018,
10.0,5 May 2020,"The series tells about a chemistry teacher who, having learned about an incurable disease, begins to engage in drug trafficking. The main idea of the creators is a metamorphosis of the character from an antogonist to protogonist. The initial goal of the material well-being of the family after death becomes blurred towards the end. Walter, the protagonist, begins to like doing this business, begins to think like a criminal leader. Recommend watching this series to fans of crime and Mexican drug cartels. The tape itself is an example of the transformation of the characters to opposite ones towards the end. Left a mark in popular culture. I recommend for viewing."
9.0,28 June 2018,Will never get tired watching this series all over again!! Yeah b*tch!!:D
10.0,16 July 2023,"Great show, great story in general. However, Walt and Pinkman are the most annoying leads of any series ever made. Pinkman is a disaster in the 1st half, but turns into a great guy in the 2nd half. And the same goes for Walt the other way around. He was a hero in the first half but turned into the biggest prick who ever lived and who dies alone - for a reason. Because nobody likes him anymore. When Walt has not much time left to live because of his cancer, even his only son tells him on the phone why he is calling him, that he is an ashole and that he should die already. Because of what he has done.

Walt is indeed a bastard. But that doesn't mean it's a bad series. All the characters are fantastic characters, played by great actors. Hank, the Salamancas and many more.

But one thing is really badly done. A crucial part of the story is not believable. Look here: "".... Hell yeah. I won against the Mexican drug cartel and the drug lords of New Mexico. I am Heisenberg. .... But wait....there's still evidence against me that would put me in jail....damn it. It is a laptop with sensitive data against me. This laptop is being kept at the police station in a secure room with armed guards. Damn it. There is evidence against the mafia, all kinds of criminals and drug clans. But hey, no problem.... nothing easier than that. All I need is a magnetic crane from the car crusher.... We'll take it to the guarded vault and have a bit of World War 3. Isn't that a great idea?"". They did it, and it worked. This sounds like a story written by a 7 year old child.

Be realistic.

That's why this series doesnt deserve the perfect rating. But what do I know about people.... Some think, Walt is a cool guy...... Jesus."

10.0,3 July 2022,One rhe best story and super strong script. Each and everything is perfectly balanced. The only character that gets on your nerves is his wife and at few scene she is untolerable.
10.0,5 May 2019,"""Breaking Bad"" is one of the best TV shows for multiple reasons but mainly is that it have the perfect sequence of events (even if they weren't planned ahead before pilot episode) and the well chosen cast. The flip in Walter's life is the one that is of importance here but still you have a ton a lot of characters that do not fade away (by feeling they are only tools to showcase Walter's behaviour) but instead you care for them as they are related to Walter White by a mean or another and can play considerable part in Walter's progress in this TV show. Walter White has always been ""Heisenberg"" but needed something to break the shell to fly out. Its never boring and you don't feel a scene or episode is wasted (in general)."
10.0,8 September 2018,Madness. That's the name of this tv show wich has opened the world of tv series and wich is an will be the best series of all time
10.0,7 November 2019,"Awsomme film keeping it coming more more episodes, bravo bravo bravo"
9.0,21 January 2023,"Breaking bad is one of two of my favorite shows ever. The plot, amazing. The acting, incredible. The characters. The relations. The emotions, the attention to detail, the hints for what will come next, the way it's filmed, the funny bits. The heartbreaking parts. How it escalates so severely over the seasons and how the decent, older man, Walter, becomes a meth-cooking murderer. How the troubled Jesse gets his life stolen and instead receives real bad trauma. I didn't think a show could be this wonderful from start to finish until I watched Breaking bad. It's too rare that a series is so captivating from the very first to the very last episode.

I think everyone should watch this show. Doesn't matter if you got experience with criminality and drugs or if you aced all your classes in high school and are now working with finances. Just watch it."
10.0,9 July 2018,"The only reason I gave it a nine is because of the character skyler..It's a nice serial not a movie .. but I hate the character skyler.. this is the type of woman who will kill u ... who thinks they always right .. even if they have done any terrible mistake and blame it because of u or the others.. I get irritated wen ever I see her .. she is the main reason who can get u killed in ur life .. Hats off to the director who casted a character skyler and the actress looks the women who can do this .this is y lot of people get divorced ,, who can't give peace to their husband .. and more common in USA.. .. whom do u hate the most in breaking bad ..

10.0,14 May 2018,"Once a lifetime a series comes and leaves the audience in complete astonishment from start to finish! Breaking Bad is that series! The impeccable writing team lead by its creator Vince Giligan and the lead star Bryan Cranston who delivers one of the greatest, most convincing, and powerful performances in the history of Cinema, TV, and theater; engraving his mark on history! It's so well made, that you as an audience become a member of the cast, living with them and sharing their experiences!

10.0,23 December 2019,Director Vince and actor Bryan and Aaron was great in their work. Every season is better than the last season. It's the story of a simple become a drug lord
10.0,14 April 2023,"Breaking Bad is a television series that left a profound impact on me. From its gripping storyline to its masterful acting, every aspect of this show is executed flawlessly. As I watched the show, I was sucked into the world of Walter White and his descent into the drug trade. I felt like I was experiencing the highs and lows alongside the characters.

One of the things that made Breaking Bad so successful is its ability to evoke a range of emotions. From sadness and despair to excitement and adrenaline, the show kept me on the edge of my seat. I remember feeling a sense of dread as I watched Walter White struggle to balance his double life as a high school chemistry teacher and a drug kingpin. His internal struggle was palpable and made me question what I would do in his shoes.

The show also utilized dark humor and sarcasm to great effect. There were moments where I found myself laughing out loud at the absurdity of the situations the characters found themselves in. The juxtaposition of the humor and the darker themes of the show made it all the more impactful.

The acting in Breaking Bad was also exceptional. Bryan Cranston's portrayal of Walter White was nothing short of brilliant. He brought a depth to the character that made me feel both sympathy and revulsion towards him. Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman was equally impressive. His character arc was one of the most satisfying aspects of the show.

The cinematography and soundtrack of Breaking Bad were also noteworthy. The show's use of color and lighting to reflect the mood of the scene was masterful. The soundtrack was also perfectly curated, with songs that perfectly complemented the tone of the show.

Overall, Breaking Bad is a show that will stay with me for a long time. It's a masterclass in storytelling, acting, and filmmaking. It's a show that made me feel a range of emotions, from the highest highs to the lowest lows. It's a show that I will continue to recommend to anyone looking for a thrilling and emotional viewing experience."
10.0,21 January 2023,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad is able to consistently maintain the engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence, and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it. This show is about as pure as Walt's meth."
9.0,22 January 2018,I watched so many different tv series. by far this was the best ever in my life. thanks for the producer and actors
10.0,11 June 2018,"At first it is boring But be patient and see

Do not hurry. You will see the wonder"
10.0,15 November 2012,"Since you are checking out Breaking Bad on IMDb, you already know this show so you are probably hooked on it as well as I am. For those still doubting when to start watching it, make it a top priority! Leave the groceries in the hallway, the goldfish can go on a diet, leave it all and go watch. It really is as good as everybody says it is. All the actors give Oscar-worthy performances, but you can tell the crew is giving their best as well. The interiors of the houses feel very real, whether it is the house of a drug addict or a middle-income family. I want to commend the casting agency for all the right picks, and the writers for developing believable story lines and making all the pieces fit even after five seasons. The actors also deserve a compliment for showing all aspects of their character's grief, including showing them on their most vulnerable and ugly moments."
10.0,14 September 2021,"U will fall in love with everything. As seasons passes,ur mind will blow. The Best is The Breaking Bad."
10.0,6 June 2015,"Breaking Bad is one of the best TV series I have watched. I started enjoying the show from it's first episode and enjoyed till the end of it.

It's about drug, about family, about friendship, violence, trade, business, investigation, law and risks and luck. White and Pinkman as partners, is a perfect casting. Hank's satirical and comedy punches are also equally interesting.

Curiosity is always at its peak. I not just felt for the protagonists, but also for wide number of characters. In short, I developed sound rapport with most characters during my watch.

If you are in dilemma, you shouldn't. You will love it, trust me!"
9.0,2 October 2019,It takes a lot to keep me invested in a TV series until series fin....OH LOOK SQUIRREL
10.0,1 May 2023,"A worthy show and won't bore you a little a night i didn't sleep for it and it is killing awesome show , Walter white a character you'll love from episode 1 and you'll start hating him too in between season 4_5 , Jesse You'll Hate since start and you'll love his innocence and basic human nature from season 4-5 and Skyler you'll definitely hate her for having too much going but the character is going through much you'll understand it later , She's right I hated Walter White from season 4 , and he's most cunning bastard character of show.

Hank is Hulk of show a Great Hero , Marie his wife a great character.

Loved this show and writing this review at season 5 episode 5 and it's 2 pm in noon i started in night 12 am watching it in between had something else too but it's worth watching when you can't sleep at nights - TIME KILLER ."
10.0,31 October 2018,So great series! I am just amazed! The best one I have seen till now
9.0,3 April 2020,Yes this is a showade in 2008 and made by Vince Gilligan what more do you want me to say
9.0,15 December 2019,"A willing suspension of disbelief and reluctant mindset is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is completely and utterly implausible to believe that anyone similar Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught within the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic relatable characters, who nearly all resonate with most watchers, allow you to willingly set aside any differences with plausibility (which, commonly, the show does not mind doing). For the most part, all the seasons are very well put together, with each having some of the greatest episodes of any show I've ever seen. Though season 2, as it is, is pretty bad compared to most of the other seasons. Now don't quote me on this because when I say bad I mean Breaking Bad levels of bad, which compared to other TV series is much less of a considerable insult. Like most shows I recommend not watching this out of order; More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so excruciatingly fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you won't want to miss a second. So yeah, go check it out."
10.0,26 November 2019,"What makes breaking bad special from other tv shows is its attention to detail. Every part matters on the grand scheme of things. It is an amazingly well written show, and I hope there were more like it."

10.0,19 January 2023,"I've watched many series but breaking bad is just supreme. When breaking bad comes comparisons end because their is no show that can beat this quality..... Everything cinematography, character building, plot, pacing, cast, dialogues, story writing is perfect.

10.0,8 April 2018,Well thought out TV series. Definitely a thumbs up!!!
10.0,26 February 2019,Amazing characters and storrytelling is what set this show apart from the rest. It's heads and toes above from most tv shows.
8.0,28 May 2014,"Well the whole thing was very spectacular, the minute details were taken care of. The ending and everything is realistic of what should have happened in real life consequences. The Story revolves around The Crystal Meth and about how a Nobel Prize Winner wasn't given much appreciation later in his life, probably it was his choices. It has always been his choices about everything he did and he really liked it, we can see him singing while enjoying his glorious crimes and concentrating on something which is illegal, his love for his ninety-nine percent blue baby is fascinating, it comes down to crime and Murders and how the things that mattered the most in life were turned up against him, the sudden realization of losing all that he cared for was tempting and making him clear that it was his love for chemistry that didn't changed and so the two years he lived in his tactical Benevolence was way better than his fifty years of Mundane surviving."
8.0,7 August 2019,"I wanted to tell you guys many things about this tv/web series but i don't want to spoil you guys, It's just amazing, every character is pretty good and there are lots of scene that gave me goosbumbs like hell, I have watched many web/tv series like dark,money heist,game of thrones but still breaking bad is far better than any of them imo and i want to forget everything and watch it again."
9.0,5 June 2022,"Goat show, if u say anything else you're wrong. I've watched the show like 4 times and it's still good to watch. Breaking Bad is on the same level of the greatest piece of fiction Morbius. What i'm trying to say is that this show changed my life for the better. And it also contains a deep character arc which is amazing. There's maybe a few bad characters in the show, but most of them are great. HUEL is goated bye cuz."

10.0,22 April 2018,"The characters role play was marvelous, looks like real life acting. In the 20-30 minutes of 1st episode you will know what the tv series is all about. Each and every episode was full of suspense and thriller. I can say it's better than game of thrones if you are a suspense lover. Must watch..."
10.0,24 December 2019,"I've never seen a tv series cares about details this much. I enjoyed every single thing about breaking bad. This masterpiece will never be forgotten as long as humans keep talking about great writing, directing, acting..etc."
10.0,23 August 2019,The best series of all time 😍😍😍 My favorite part is the end of season 4
9.0,4 February 2019,The best show in its time! Unveils the curtain on so many different issues around how far someone would go to help his family. The characters truly come through in this series so much so that it's addicting to watch. AMC was very lucky to have this series on their network and I haven't been able to find another series that matches it. It came in with a bang and ended too soon. For many viewers but I think they ended it perfectly as far as the amount of seasons. They didn't get greedy like other shows in the same era. I'd watch this entire show again and again. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to get hooked right from episode one. Bing worthy show!
10.0,10 December 2018,Breaking Bad is the best thing ever happened. I still can't believe it's over.

10.0,18 October 2019,"Spoiler Free Review. :) I remember watching season 1 and being like; ""damn, that's so good. probably going to get ruined if there are 5 seasons.""

Now I remember season 1 as one of the worse seasons, not that it is bad, it's breathtaking, but it honestly just gets better. Walter White is by far the most interesting and fun to watch character ever. The way he changes in the series is fantastic. As well as every single character on this show, they are all so well written and holy crap so well acted. Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gun, Giancarlo Esposito, Dean Norris, Charles Baker, Raymond Cruz, Bob Odenkirk... I want to mention everyone. they are all so, so good.

The story is so simple yet so good, all dots connect somehow. I don't even know how Vince managed to do that. It gets so crazy that it's hard for me to explain. Walter, Jesse and Gus are probably my favorite characters on the show. They are all so fun to watch and so well acted.

If you haven't watched it yet then... you are just missing the best show there will ever be on TV."
10.0,28 October 2018,Just watch it. Then you'll know why it's a 10/10. Such a great show. It'll keep you hooked no matter what.

9.0,3 September 2021,
10.0,10 March 2019,This is one of the all time great series and great for rainy day watching.
10.0,31 March 2018,"...episode in Season 4 'the Fly'...then again a great 'read' and equally a 'show' by Cranston, which admittedly, I was not expecting.

Walter White has momentary moments of decency and accountability but, in the end, he's all about himself and his self-pitying on why he got screwed, regardless of his accepting what he negotiated from his fellow college classmates in their 'chemistry classes and their subsequent 'idea' on what their analysis of their discovery, is the genesis of his own depravity.

See this if only for the great ensemble of true talent from all assembled. The script writers have truly selected the right actors for each role. We don't have anyone acting in 'brown face' for Hispanics rather we have authentic portrayals by all. Mark Margolis is, once again, remarkable in this series as well as the prequel 'Better Call Saul'. In fact watch 'Better Call Saul' before you watch 'Breaking Bad' - it'll make a lot more sense.

Cranston, as 'Walter White', is excellent but thankfully he gets what he so justly deserves as does 'Jesse'.....watch the series and enjoy the ride. The brother-in-law 'Hank' is your typical 'white bread' hard ass cop but he is also someone who understands the reality of the 'barbarians' (Mexican drug cartels) at the gates. His finest hour is when he understands the corruption in El Paso of the federal DEA as the US officers mock him by using Spanish in his presence but he viscerally 'knows' their (US officers) socializing with known Mexican drug 'informants' is a indolent, compromised effort by US officials who are supposed to protect us from monsters rather than play golf with them.

A great and enobilling series of true commentary on the moral decline of our nation by the relativists who 'act' like the 'high priests' of 'Shinar' before God scattered all of them to the 4 winds of the earth. Bet 'Barakska' loved this series until that scene at the pool down in Mexico in Season 5....'Barakska' man de' koolest prez we evah had...lazy is my name and the smooth con is my game....just ask CNN huh fools?"
10.0,20 July 2018,This show is simply amazing. I wish I can convince Gilligan for another season as tears filled my eyes watching the season finale.You will enjoy the amazing cinematography of this show in every minute. The chemistry between Walt and Jesse will make you fall in love with chemistry again. You will never regret watching this show.
10.0,24 May 2019,"Breaking Bad has in my opinion the Greatest Acting, the best Story ,The Best Finale, Pilot, Episodes, Transformation, Quotes to any show ever. I mean it is unquestionable The Most Perfect TV SHOW Ever!"
10.0,1 February 2020,"This is my first review on IMDB and it's so addictive that I just watched the entire 62 episodes of breaking bad in 4Days ,well that's an achievement for an outstanding tv series , absolute brilliant ,way too much believable and Vince Gilligan,Peter Gould you beauty ,I mean it's something new and an essence that gives you a lot of pain and pleasure during the entire time of watching process once again thankyou for making this tv series I can't get over of it"
8.0,1 October 2019,This is one of the best tv series i've seen. The characters of Walter and Pinkman are great.
9.0,23 September 2021,There will never be another masterpiece of a show like this.
10.0,19 August 2018,Rewatching now that better call Saul is closing the gap on the timeline whereas by end of current season 4 we will be at breaking bad point in time. Already are just have not fully but when it happens I suggest everyone rewatch this and if you have never seen it you are missing out on best show in modern history if not ever IMHO. Def watch both but this one is a must see for sure! Better call Saul is def worth investing in. But both? Epic stuff going on here.
10.0,6 January 2022,It was such an amazing adventure and i loved the characters build up an overall good experience. But i found some episodes boring and i think it could've been shorter than 5 seasons.
10.0,30 August 2021,
10.0,20 August 2021,I have waited so many years to actually watch and enjoy this and it was worth the wait. The love I have for Jesse and his character development is insane. To anyone that is wanting to watch it I would definitely recommend it. It is worth the wait.
10.0,28 August 2021,
10.0,27 August 2019,This is one of the best TV show I have ever watched from characters to story everything is just in its place. Waiting dor the movie now!
10.0,2 November 2018,I have to admit that I wasn't enthusiastic at all in the first 2 seasons. But it is really worth watching this show. Especially the last 3 episodes are mind blowing!
10.0,5 May 2018,It was a real pleasure to watch this masterpiece !!! Thank you Vince Gilligan and all staff members !!!
10.0,11 April 2021,"Best movie in yhe world l,in the university.i love that movie you know."
9.0,20 February 2023,"I can't explain in words how good it is! It has everything an audience needs; a perfect story, actors and actresses, story telling, and the list goes on. I used to ignore this series because I would think that it's probably not the good series i would watch, but I forced myself to watch this masterpiece, oh man!

I wish I had watched it earlier. It made me sad knowing that it ended on season 5. If you are confused whether to watch it or not, you are missing a whole lot here. I want to thank Director, producer, actors, actresses and many more people who worked in this series for creating this masterpiece movie."
10.0,3 May 2018,"It's the second time I've written here, I've never been very good at it, but I couldn't leave this series behind, I had to come here to leave you my opinion. I feel that I have lived for almost a month in a world completely apart from what I was accustomed to, in the midst of wars, drugs, despair, between illnesses and always with my heart in my hands almost in every episode, was an whole other perspective of what surrounds me. But it was a good experience, the way the series captivates us, watching the growth of Jesse and the transformation of Walter, it was soo amazing to see! Many people had recommended me to see this series and I've never seen much interest until finally coming here to IMDb and seeing the trailer and realizing that it was a very good series. I gave it to me to pass from a person who thought that it was more a series like the others to idolize both Walter and Jesse for being phenomenal personages. I regret the fact that this series isn't rated best here because it deserves a 10. For all the good representation by the characters and the way it was edited and performed, what quality! This series will be one of those that will see and review and recommend to all who wanted to see something with excellent content and as well represented as Breaking Bad. So, I recommend you to see if you have not seen it, because you are missing one of the best things ever done in the world of cinema. For those who have seen it, enjoy it again, because it is worth it."
9.31,19 March 2023,"The title says it all

Breaking bad is one of the most emotional and amazing shows ever to exist. The content amazing storytelling, cinematography, character arcs and world building is absolutely phenomenal. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul both put in their best work and it shows, the characters of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are one of the best in tv history, both with amazing sub plots, arcs and scenes. Each and every scene in this show is portrayed to near perfection, and no other show will ever live up to how amazing this one is. In short, breaking bad is the best show to ever be made and i highly recommend it to anyone this hasn't seen it, it is simply too good not to watch."
9.31,23 September 2018,
9.31,14 June 2015,
9.31,4 March 2017,"Best TV series that I had ever watched. Most of series lost it's momentum after 2 or 3 season, but the essence of this show is that every season it you are more in it. Throughout the show, you are facing bittersweet feeling towards the main lead. After watching season 1 you think it is overrated (imdb-9.5),but seriously hook up for season 2 and after that you regret why there are only 5 seasons. This series gives you a roller-coaster of emotions.Without giving spoilers, just watch the show how beautifully they execute each minute details and excellent writing."
9.31,20 January 2023,"This is the greatest TV show that has ever existed. The story is brilliant, the actors are perfect and the camera work is outstanding. I can't say enough how amazing this show is.

I highly recommend that you watch it. It's awesome. The characters in the story are so complex and are played superbly by the actors playing them.

I can't leave out the fact that breaking bad is famous for its seriously clever cliffhangers.

Honestly, the cliffhangers just make me want to watch more and more and more.

Word of warning, this series will probably make you feel that every other show that you watch after it will seem crap compared to it."
9.31,1 October 2019,BEST SHOW ON TV EVER MADE! WHY DISCONTINUED ILL NEVER KNOW! SHAME
9.31,10 April 2018,"Oh my God, this is just great. I never anticipated this series to be laugh out loud funny. The main characters are great, I take my hat off for Bryan Cranston portraying Walter Heisenberg. All the actors are just killing it. Walters character development is interesting to say the least. Meth cooking by your next door neurotic chemistry teacher...go figure. It´s hilarious. And it hits hard too. I´m at the end of season 2. Ep 1-2 Season 2 isn´t that good, but I am very happy I gave it one more chance."
9.31,7 March 2022,"This show has amazing cinematography, extremely good writing, very well made characters and the list goes on.

After watching Breaking Bad i've never gotten this amount of emotions from any other movie/series. This TV show will always have a special place in my heart especially because of the perfect ending and also the amazing use of Badfinger's Baby Blue as the credits roll for one last time."
9.31,31 January 2018,"Although I've never watched an episode of GOT, I believe Breaking Bad is the best dark dramedy ever put on television. If the vastly underrated pilot episode doesn't hook you, then I don't know what will. Breaking Bad is almost too good to describe."

9.31,25 May 2020,"It's a roller coaster of love and hate and a finale full of depression and hate - no love for me. Very hard to watch if you ask me. Well written, great actors, very nice cinematography; love the conversation long shots. It was worth the time. A long painful journey. One of the few series I could watch twice. Just not now."
9.31,28 January 2018,"I think I was never in my Life so hooked from a TV Show like i was into Breaking Bad. The Writing, The Acting, The Direction, The Storyline is just stunningly Perfect. In my Opinion it can´t get any better than this in Drama TV, so you definetely should check this out if you haven´t already."
9.31,11 April 2013,"I HATE roughly 95% of all television shows that I've ever seen. It offends my intelligence, my world view, and pretty much everything else I hold dearly. Breaking Bad is still television...but its *good* television. Sure, there are some cringe-worthy moments. The presentation of the Salamanca brothers was down-right uncharacteristically cartoonish and silly, with their melodramatic silence and oh-so-menacing expressions. But I forgive Breaking Bad. Jesse is irritatingly familiar, the scumbag bro you hoped you wouldn't see at parties, played to perfection by Aaron Paul (I'm hoping its not one of those ""Keaneau Reeves"" scenarios, where he is actually ALWAYS an airhead). You just wanna smack a bro, at times. But I got over it, even grew to like this character at times. Funny, the way the writers play with us, so deftly injecting and removing our sympathies at the drop of a pork-pie hat. Without spoilers, I've had issues with some of season 5 as well, as some of the subtleties in Walt's development, some of his lines, seem to have been exchanged for the more predictable and cheesy TV/Hollywood tropes. And yet...I am still counting the months until July, when we'll all be put out of our collective, suspenseful misery. Hopefully, in a good way. Because, despite these and a few other missteps, I haven't been this engaged in a TV show since I can remember.

For some reason, likely a surplus of spare time that we won't go into, I've now watched the first 4.5 seasons, twice. I am notoriously picky, and an infamous hater of most things that appear on the small screen. Why? Because TV most often lacks the focused creative genius that is allowed in film. There is no independent venue for TV, as there is for film. Either you're palatable to the larger American audience, or you don't make it past the pilot episode (assuming you aren't shooting for the dreaded network TV stations, where creativity and intellect are sacrificed at the whims of advertising dollars. I think I've vomited on the keyboard.) Amidst all of the prerequisite cartoon violence and melodrama, there are some absolutely poignant moments--and having watched a father of the same age (and similar life situation) encounter cancer--with a less spectacular outcome--I quickly noted that Walt's experience, sans descent into Scarface, was hauntingly realistic. The struggle of each character's encounter with existential malaise and disappointment, the will to survive, and the will to power, amidst all of the fantastic fictional elements, are incredibly real--and not just for Walt, but for almost every single character on the show; from Hank to Marie, Gus, Skylar, Mike, etc. Though I may not even agree with Gilligan's philosophical premises about the nature of morality (or maybe I do...I'll see how this ends!), I applaud the refreshing way in which it is being explored. Our protagonist constantly makes the wrong choices. Or were they wrong? We aren't exactly sure. Is there redemption? We don't know that, either. Now, again, you can bicker about the merits of this quandary, but the point is that this show is engaging enough to keep us guessing."
9.31,19 January 2022,"I have never seen such deeply developed and charismatic characters.

The acting is certainly on top. The most interesting thing is that after the first couple of episodes it is very hard to believe that many admire this series. But then, when the plot begins to unwind, it no longer reduces the speed. It is impossible to break away from him. Of course, I would like to say a separate thing about the final. This is the only, I think, the right ending that this series could have. And the final dialogue with his wife is also extremely clear and clear.

The whole point of the series is in the dialogues. There are a lot of competent and correct thoughts.

The series is about the struggle of good and evil, about mistakes and their consequences, about simple moral values, about greed, pride, vanity and much more."
9.31,1 May 2018,
9.31,8 November 2018,"A brilliant series!

The characters are very believable and realistic. There are some truly funny moments that you can imagine would happen in reality when things don't quite go to plan.

Jesse is a truly irritating character, full of his own self pity and selfishness which I have to say is played to perfection by Aaron Paul. Would I watch it again? Yes, the entire and full set of series."

9.31,10 April 2023,"Breaking Bad (2008-2013) is a series that I recently completed on Netflix. The storyline follows a chemistry teacher who discovers he is dying of cancer and wants to earn money for his family before passing away. He decides to become a meth cook with one of his students. He will need to keep the operation hidden from his wife, disabled son and detective brother-in-law while adjusting to dealing with some unsavory characters in this line of work.

This series was created by Vince Gilligan (The X-Files) and stars Bryan Cranston (Argo), Aaron Paul (The Last House on the Left), Giancarlo Esposito (The Usual Suspects), Anna Gunn (Sully), Bob Odenkirk (Nobody), Dean Norris (Total Recall) and Jonathan Banks (Gremlins).

This has to be the most consistent series ever created. This literally feels like one long movie more than a series broke up into seasons. There's a consistent feel and pace to every episode, season and storyline. The characters are worthwhile and you can find yourself rooting for and against them at the same time. The main character is great but also annoying and arrogant. Jesse is a dumbass at times, but you also feel sorry for him and hope he succeeds. The side characters are also remarkable - Hank, Gus, Walter, Saul, Skyler and Jr are all tremendous. This is also one of those series where even the finale lives up to expectations.

Overall, this is a remarkably consistent series from the first to the last episode. An absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."

I have little more to say on this show that has been so well-reviewed in so many places over the past several years. It is the rare combination of being both an ambitious and artistically successful story and also an entertaining adventure that pulls no punches.

Both mundane and terrifying, ""Breaking Bad"" is the triumphant icon of our golden age of television.

Enjoy it. I know I have.

9.31,1 January 2020,"I'm a movie watcher! And i shoudl tell you tha in 99% of times director screws the movie with a bad ending. All the time i was stressed for the ending. By the end, i was happy for the very hood and realistic ending. It satisfied everyone."
9.31,28 August 2019,Amazing & unbelievable acting and drama. I will not see a show in this level. Thanks Mr. Walt & gessi your performances are a role models.
9.31,18 September 2019,"It's very rare to find a series that keeps getting better as the seasons go on. In Breaking Bad's case, it peaked at the very end. Whilst watching I was hooked from the first episode, and I thought it was amazing then, but as I watched it more and more, it continued to keep surprising me. Bryan Cranston's performance is immaculate with Aaron Paul's contributing to my favourite duo in TV. The plot twists and element of surprise this show had on me is simply amazing, and I would pay good money to watch it again for the first time."
9.31,28 March 2018,"This show had me completely glued to my screen,at work I couldn't think of anything other than get home and catch up on where i left,complete master piece. There is this episode about a fly, but still kept me thinking about that fly!!! Big up to this show"

9.31,18 February 2023,"In point at - (in Jesse's Home)- it is real OSCARisng episode __ for (BREAKING BAD). More info. Maybe little Spoiling: If anyone is interested in the topic, it is about the part in this series when Walt came to Jesse's house to find out if he left any evidence at the crime scene... And besides, that music in the background... in the balance it's Oscar winning episode.

Oscar in the point of S.4 Ep.4 (in Jesse's Home)

And if to say in general for the whole series: Although not everything in this film is very cool, it is beautiful, well shot and presented. But still, very vital and with the most open moments. When you watch a film and understand that you are watching someone's real life with all the life circumstances that cannot be ignored, from which the plot is further woven. It is very concentrated and at the same time balanced. That is, the filming and the actors' performances in a talented and balanced way cannot help but touch the viewer with their frankness and sometimes realism. When realism, it is more correctly presented situation. When the viewer is warmed up with curiosity about the environment and is shown by this environment that it is really alive and could be and is. And that's what makes the series so exciting... Those who have seen it and those who filmed this movie product will understand. Very big well done, well done. But in between, there are also miscalculations - a very frequent phenomenon in modern cinematography, when certain tangential moments in the script and plot are blurred. And unfortunately, this series also has moments with an unpleasant aftertaste. A very vivid example. This is a series with an air traffic controller, when the father of the girl Jesse, could not bear the death of his daughter, and made a mistake that led to the tragedy. In this series, as in the previous one, there was great potential for a full disclosure of the problem and what happened to his daughter, from the father's side. But the creators of the series, for some reason, sharply hushed everything up and did not allow these moments to be revealed. This spoiled the perception of possible realistic - and what it would be like in reality... This is just one example. But all the others are already more minor.. All these miscalculations find their place in this series, and they do not embellish it, but on the contrary take something away from it..."
9.31,7 March 2020,"The author: (Vince Gilligan) was Born on February 10, 1967

After being diagnosed with a fatal lung cancer, a high school chemistry teacher cooks and sells meth to support his family.

""Breaking Bad,"" a new seven-part series on AMC about a middle-aged chemistry teacher in Albuquerque who becomes a methamphetamine dealer, The series has a slight vein of black humor, but it is very, very dark, The series is very enthusiastic and exciting in all its parts, And I love the main character: walter white I hate Skyer and her personality in the series, Walter White was a very clever personality and had a lot of trouble especially the part when he was stuck in the desert, The series is very interesting, how Walter White suffered, and how he succeeded in helping his family and their troubles, The series has a wonderful and dramatic ending, finally, I highly recommend watching this series.

9.31,12 August 2013,"Photography, acting, storyline. Relationships intermingle with action. Unpredictable plot turns. Great character development. I cant think of any TV drama that comes close. (Seinfeld is a 10 but thats a different genre). The dynamic between Walt and Jesse, Walt and Skyler and Walt and Hank each have their own development ups and downs. The beginning of each show is an attention grabber, the viewer gets immediately hooked. I especially love the colorful supporting characters: lawyer Saul who acts unethical and illegal but strangely is loyal to his clients and can be trusted with millions of dollars. Mike is from the old Mafia school and of course Hank's wife is hilarious. Having a handicapped child, cancer and a cheating wife gives drug dealer Walt some sympathy. Will his empire grow? Or will it collapse? Great show!"

9.31,20 November 2019,I got into this show half way through since my husband convined me to start it. We had to go back and watch all the first ones again which he didnt mind. There are a few episodes in the middle that are kinda boring. There's one where the two main guys talk the whole time in the lab and I dont see the pint of that but pretty much the rest is great. You dont get bored and seeing it without commercials on dvd is the way to do it!
9.31,17 July 2018,It may go on a slow pace but I think it is pretty necessary to go on this pace to develop plot Other than that it is the best TV show you will ever see in your life Every performance is top notch Especially Bryan Cranston
9.31,13 October 2018,"I'm so addicted to it.. I'm on series 2 ep 8 at the mo and loving it It's just very different and scientific!

Since I've seen stranger things and was struggling to find a good series but this one is up there with stranger things and the punisher"
9.31,24 September 2017,People who love reality should go for this show. It starts slow but it does not lose a grip anywhere. Last season is mind blowing u will find some sensible conversation and sensible spin off. Storyline is so good the best thing about this series is direction is at its best. The way they describe everything without any dialog feels awesome while watching it. If u think like a common man u also can predict the show while seeing it. So best of luck and go for it
9.31,25 January 2014,This is a fantastic series and if you give it 3 episodes you'll be addicted. The changes within the characters throughout the series' is brilliant but myself I found the ending incredibly predictable and disappointing. This is what stopped it getting a 10/10 from me. The tension and cliffhangers leave you wanting more and I myself spent 3 weeks watching the episodes back to back between working. This programme doesn't really have a target audience because everything about it is so good. Basically if you're not into it after 3 episodes stop watching. Second only to my number 2 GOT (but you have to like the genre) and my number 1 'The Shield' which has numerous themes used in Breaking BAd.
9.31,8 April 2018,If you never watched breaking bad I wish I was you. One of the best emotional and realistic tv show ever
9.31,21 January 2023,"Breaking bad is JUST PERFECT, it makes you forget your watching a show and transports you to Albuquerque, New Mexico, not to mention the characters, the top tier acting, the plot and storyline, the setting-just phenomenal. Nothing is rushed, the series takes its time because it knows how good it is, it knows it has you hooked. Walter White is the epitomy of an anti-hero that u have no choice but to root for and was juss perfectly written and he's almost father-son -like relationship with the masochistic Jesse Pinkman softens the action just enough to tug at your heart strings.

Must watch-10/10."

9.31,21 September 2018,"Great acting, characters, plot, shooting, writing, all great. One of the best scenes I refer to as traffic lights...if your not sure if this was a great show search ""breaking bad traffic lights"" just a snippet of the heart of the writing that went into this show that had me hooked from the start - take the time to enjoy you won't regret"
9.31,14 October 2019,"After watching El Camino, figured I go back through BB. Only a couple of episodes in. Damn, this is good tv. Highly recommend to anyone, even for a second time around."
9.31,14 October 2018,"Loved this show! Well-timed dark humour and very disturbing turns. Unexpected violence. The bad guys probably were a bit over acted at times but for the most part, an awesome series!"
9.31,17 September 2020,"Completed the Series a couple of days back, a great one but in no way this is ""the best or even one of the best"" Too overhyped by the fanbase The last season was the best of all Very predictable plotline, unnecessary dragging of the story countless number of times etc 8.5/10"
9.31,8 April 2018,"Not as good as Game of Thrones, but it's pretty good. Pretty exemplary character development and just the right balance of comedy... actually I'm not sure about that. The comedic elements, albeit very very funny, are just not realistic so they take you out of the element of ""being there"" in the series, but other than that and some bad acting, especially the stereotypical typecast druggies, the series is pretty good. Definitely worth a watch."
9.31,22 April 2014,"First off I have never been one to describe anything as perfect in the past. Every girl, show, movie, book, etc. I can always find a flaw with anything especially TV shows and movies other people think are amazing. But I must admit breaking bad is the most amazing TV show; from the acting, plot, writing, directing, and cinematography it is dare I say: perfect! Highly recommend if your a fan of dark comedies, or good filmmaking in general. I didn't think shows could get much better than ""the wire"" or ""it's always sunny in Philadelphia"". It's even up there, or perhaps better than, such films as ""pulp fiction"" and ""the shawshank redemption"". Anyway enough complimenting this show, lord knows it has enough recognition it doesn't need me to say anything. But I will leave you with this thought, every other show I have seen in the past, when I found out it was getting canceled I was relieved since most shows have run their course by this time so I want to see how it is closed out and say goodbye for good. Not only did I not want breaking bad to be canceled but I felt it was getting better every season and needed a few more seasons to do it justice. On the bright side is you won't get bored and begging for the end, you will be begging for Vince Gilligan so release the missing seasons in the future sometimes. So if you are an intelligent, open-minded person who appreciate good television and is sick of the other 95% of mindless garbage that ruins TV, ""Breaking Bad"" is the show for you! If you watch this show and do not like it, please email me, I am curious to see what the reason is since I have never met someone who has seen the show and not loved it. Possible reasons you won't love breaking bad: 1) Your idea of a great show is ""here comes honey boo-boo"" or ""lizard lick towing"", I'm which case there is no hope for you anyway so do not waste your time filling your head with any form of intelligent programming. 2) You are a recovering meth-addict and the sight or name ""meth"" sends your life into a downward spiral where your selling your body for 5$. In which case I understand and wouldn't recommend this show, i would recommend counseling. 3) You are a hipster douschebag so the thought of liking something that everyone likes drives you crazy. So now you need to prove how much of an individual you are and go against the grain so enjoying this show would be like ""being a sheep"" or something like that. So instead of watching this show smoke your electronic cigarette indoors so people can say ""sir you can't smoke in here"", and you can promptly reply ""how it's not a real cigarette it is water vapor"" ""I only smoke it to get attention it's not harmful to anyone's physical health, only mental health. 4) And last reason you won't love breaking bad: you died and now your a ghost and can't change the channel to put it on cuz the dumb-ass human you are haunting continues to watch a marathon of ""hard-core pawn"" while chain-smoking crystal meth and e-cigs."
9.31,22 January 2020,A series of Breaking Bad legends are boring in some places but the series gets completely different towards the end.
9.31,8 June 2018,"Simply the best. Adrenalinic, ingenious and funny. This show has everything and mixes all the elements perfectly. Walter is one of the greatest created characters in the history."
9.31,3 July 2022,I cant imagine living this life without having watched breaking bad. I have a target to repeat it every 10 years. Can you believe it took me initially 3 times to start the show and stop at episode 3 every time because I was bored. Everytime I repeated watching it as if it was the first time.
9.31,20 January 2023,"The best ever series I have watched in my life. It deserves each moment I spent watching. Great amazing, wonderful story and actors. It is the series that you have to watch!

9.31,30 August 2020,"The entire show was very slow, specially season 1, i was like why the hell this show is so much hyped. There are shows which slow burn and i enjoy them too, but this show is not slow burn it is boring. From season 1 to half the season 4 it was very slow and boring. And only season 5 better."
9.31,8 August 2018,"I've never left a review on IMBD, this is the series that changed that! Impeccable in every way. Stunning performances throughout. I watched it only last year and am rewatching it as I type this.

If you're a fan of crime drama, this is the standard to which I measure any series."
9.31,14 December 2019,"This show is a simply a mixture of All genres. Crime, love , adult, action, romance, thriller, horror etc. Screenplay was just perfect. Its more like a slow poison, the more you watch,the better start liking it. Heisenberg's character which starts as a simple meth cook to an empire of drug world. walter white and jesse pinkman these two characters doesn't easily goes off the mind once you start knowing them, liking them, getting connected through them. Special mention to Skyler, marie and hank, they acted competitively to each other & at the end they are the best among them. As a fan of Comedy genres like Friends and Big bang theory, i am not much into this at beginning but once i am into this i started many other like money heist, black mirror, sense8 whatsoever thriller, scifi, drama etc."
9.31,19 January 2022,"The plot, ideas, and most importantly, the characters of the series cause a lot of conflicting feelings and emotions. The viewer does not just empathize with the characters, he is included in the action, he also has a job - he must realize what is happening, give him an objective assessment, and this is not always easy, and certainly not unambiguous. With all this, there is no sense of intricacy, the film, like many brilliant works, is deceptively simple. All this is, of course, the result of titanic work, talent and well-coordinated work of the entire team involved in the creation of the picture."
9.31,27 March 2023,Like I said it is not my favourite but it is a perfect series story build up it is a story between two guys frendship between them and that was perfect just I don't like the character of skyler actually I hate it but end fine so everything fine. I just want to say that it was perfect every thing was perfect many moves with camera angles were I have never seen moves like this that were some awkward but it was new experience like moving of a car tyre and camera is also rolling a man is moving and like his hands are moving gambridge also moving like that and capsing just his face like fpp game mode overall it is 5 star series and is very good and fantastic. That's all from me I am not anyone to judge this web series this was fantastic as hell.

9.31,11 April 2021,Best show ever I suggest if u didn't watch it yet leave it for naw and make the last one cuz after it no TV series means anything.
9.31,24 April 2015,"This is the best show i've ever seen and I don't think I will ever watch something this good on television again.

The cast is absolutely outstanding, not a single weak performance,they were all perfect: Bryan Cranston gives one of the best performances of all time and the same thing goes for Aaron Paul. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, with the best performances coming from Anna Gunn, Giancarlo Esposito, Jonathan Banks, Dean Norris, Bob Odenkirk... hell even Jesse Plemons.

Walter is (and by far) the best character of TV history and his evolution an relationship with Jesse are two most interesting and addictive things ever. There's not a lot of comedy but when the show wants to be funny is HILARIOUS.

The directing is stunning; every episode is a visual masterpiece and some directors (not only from TV) could learn something out of this).

The original soundtrack is beautiful and incredibly intense (Crawl Space) and the non original songs made this one of my favorite soundtracks of all time.

Each season is better than the last one, look my at 10/10 rating for the episodes on each season:

.S1: Pilot .S2: Phoenix, ABQ .S3: Fly, Half Measures, Full Measure S4.: Crawl Space, End Times, Face Off S5: Live Free or Die, Say My Name, Confessions, Ozymandias, Granite State, Felina

Perfect writing, perfect acting, perfect direction and soundtrack... go watch the show."
9.31,17 February 2014,"Loved every minute of this show. The development of the characters, the acting. All just compelling viewing and believable until season 3's ""fly"" episode. OMG! What were they thinking? The main guys Walt and Jesse acted out of their characters. Especially, usually smart Walt using a clipboard, a shoe and a mop to kill a fly... in a lab? Then the two start hitting each other that I can only liken to watching Curly and Moe of The Three Stooges. Were the original writers on strike or were they on methampethemine when they made this episode? It was a waste of time and should not have been made and included on the series. I still love this show and will pretend this sorry episode did not happen."
9.31,5 September 2021,If you didn't see this show than you are missing alot buddy.
9.31,25 January 2018,"Breaking Bad is like Crystal Meth, you'll get addicted... The ""chemistry"" between the teacher and his student, the two parters, two friends, a father son like relationship and enemies of each other... These two are the highlights of the show... The Last Fifth Season is the Ultimate season... Its the best finale season of all time of any show... Watch the Series... It will be an experience..."
9.31,20 September 2021,"One of the most mind blowing and addictive experiences you'll ever have. Breaking Bad. Straight from the mind of the genius writer Vince Gilligan. Starring the amazing Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul. Breaking Bad is as close to a perfect show as it gets. The acting, the story, the pacing, the directing, and especially the writing. It's a show that hooks you right away and doesn't let up. The suspense builds all the way up to the end and then it's over and you are sad. I didn't think Breaking Bad would live up to the incredibly high expectations I had for it but It just might've. One of my favorite shows of all time. 10/10. Sensational."
9.31,3 April 2019,"The best series, all the scenes were so smoothly, the actress really were so good"
9.31,9 October 2019,"When you watch this show you will not be Able to se another, the quality of breaking bad, the colors is just simply perfect"
9.31,6 January 2018,"Perfect? Nah, but what ever is? Nothing. Nothing stands up to constant scrutiny, but this show was and still is quite an exhilarating journey in character development. This should have closed the book on pop culture's infatuation with exploring toxic masculinity and moral ambiguity-at based on these specific demographics, but yeah, TV AND Hollywood runs on reboots and regurgitation. Do I subscribe to all of the shows' theses about morality? I dunno. It's too incredibly well acted and engaging for those issues to take me out of the universe they've created, and it's a place you can revisit time and time again. Very, very few shows have ever pulled this off, so, kudos."
9.31,20 November 2018,"Walter H. White is a chemistry genius, but works as a chemistry teacher in an Albequerque, New Mexico high school. His life drastically changes when he's diagnosed with stage III terminal lung cancer, and given a short amount of time left to live: a mere matter of months. To ensure his handicapped son and his pregnant wife have a financial future, Walt uses his chemistry background to create and sell the world's finest crystal methamphetamine. To sell his signature ""blue meth,"" he teams up with Jesse Pinkman, a former student of his. The meth makes them very rich very quickly, but it attracts the attention of his DEA brother in law Hank. As Walt and Jesse's status in the drug world escalates, Walt becomes a dangerous criminal and Jesse becomes a hot-headed salesman. Hank is always hot on his tail, and it forces Walt to come up with new ways to cover his tracks.

Well directed throughtout the series, great cast, great acting all round. Superb drama, very addictive tv show. Each episode always leaves you wanting to watch another. I haven't been hooked to a TV show like Breaking Bad in ages.The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail.

Get on your sofa now and start watching ""Breaking Bad"" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.

Highly recommend this. Great tv show."
9.31,16 July 2020,"Till now, the best thing i have ever seen in my life. If I keep the best story, good moderate screenplay, just out of the world direction and so on, i have literaly never seen a movie or series that has PERFECT casting with the BEST top notch performances by every single characters !!!!!!!!!! And the story telling and story buildup of this series is an education lesson for upcoming directors and writers. I have just moved by this one. Highly realistic story will give u a roller coster ride for sure. Dont miss this one, just please dnt <3"

9.31,6 May 2018,"This show is absolutely a masterpiece to television. When I was fifteen I gave the first episode a try and after finishing it, I kept saying to myself ""This is the show. This is the show. This is the show."" I am sixteen now and I am still watching it again and again and again because of how much this show means to me. It has hands down the best acting I have ever witnessed, the writing is phenomenal, the character development, everything, everything, everything, everything. It is available on Netflix, so binge watch as much as you want."

9.31,25 August 2019,"It's better than Rick and morty, better than Peaky Blinders, better than Dark and obviously better than GoT, too!"
9.31,22 July 2020,"Breaking bad is one of the best things on TV for many reasons and here he told you why you should watch it:

The series is very good. It's got a catchy story, really tense situations and sometimes even funny. It's got really good photography and just great settings.

If you add to this a masterful performance by all the actors, you have a great job.

One of the things that impressed me the most was the evolution of each of the characters. Some with a supposedly unbreakable morality then turn out not to be so much. The part where you see how Mexican traffickers spend their money is very violent and raw. There is also a lot of action.

Adding all this up, you have a series with a story that you believe in, you're almost sure it can happen like that in the real world.

Finally, what has really made it good is its duration. It was designed and intended to have five seasons. When its success was overwhelming and resounding, the producer wanted to make more seasons and in the end respected exactly the five seasons not to ""burn"", and that has made this series a great product, round and with a hole in a legendary series."
9.31,9 June 2018,
9.31,8 April 2018,Extremely well played roles and a beautiful detailed production. A masterpiece.
9.31,27 May 2021,
9.31,19 March 2018,"Wow. I just watched through the whole series for the first time, and I never thought ""beautiful"" would be a word I use to describe a show about meth cooks. This show had me hating characters and loving characters simultaneously while also being marvelously shot. The dialogue was almost always great and even the weaker episodes were fantastic. This show is like The Office of dramas. Speaking of, ""Felina"" was only the second finale I shed a tear for, the other being The Office. This show is something that will live forever and will never lose its quality. Long live Heisenberg."
9.31,4 December 2019,"The producers, actors and everyone involved with Breaking Bad are comic geniuses. Not a scene rings true. In every moment the performances represent behaviour that has never occurred or never could between real human beings. Somehow the television viewing world generally regards this comedy as serious drama.

Where to begin? Why not the crazy driving scene in episode 1 of season 1? The only reason for the comical driving is to produces a crash that leads to more comedy. Ho hum, so it goes - on and on and on. Walt has coughing collapses to remind us how ill he is between periods where he seems as fit as you (probably) and I (probably not).

By the end of episode 4 I'd had enough. The paranoia scene in which happy-slappy bicycling evangelists were seen through a suppose paranoid misperception as vengeful, sword-wielding, grenade-toting bikie avengers finished it for me.

Absolute rubbish, but if America can elect you-know-who to lead them, favourable opinions of televisual crap fade into insignificance."
9.31,16 October 2021,"In S4 E7 finally it's revealed that Gus is Chilean citizen and was kicked out is the country by Pinochet. As seen on that other chapters of the serie Gus is far a good person, better, he is a delinquent minded person, who devote his life to the crime. So.... wasn't Pinochet right in kicking out this deliquent person of the country? No one wish to have such a drug dealer, or dark person in his country or am I wrong? Better positive publicity for Pinochet are rarely published. Rgds from Chile."
9.31,24 January 2022,"I decided to watch it fully recently all episodes,because I heard it's better than Ozark.. More gritty,etc.

So here's my opinion,after giving it a chance.. It's boring! Not even a slow burn or very satisfying,as the story evolves type series.

Around season 3 it had rare moments of tricking me with it starting to gain speed & thoughts it was improving,but it was a very long trip to that point & still if not for Aaron Paul it would of been a waste.

Not sure why the ratings are so high? Unless people feel boring,is the new clever art form & only certain types understand that.

Maybe a few casting changes or something, might of actually improved that.

I just know watched Ozark twice,all seasons & all episodes but frankly this.. Once was enough."

Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.

The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).

For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic"

I totally missed the eighties, nineties and 2000's. So after watching this pure marvel, pure diamond crown, I decided to search, dig into the gigantic catalogue that the 2010's and 2020's offers us. BREAKING BAD is really a top show, where you understand the difference between a series concept and a simple film. Story telling, camera work, millions of technical details make the difference between a TV show from our era and the movie matter. I already know that it will be difficult for me, if not impossible, to find something better than this one. This is the ultimate today's series stuff, the most known, prestigious, terrific. I would say, forget the rest."

The many twists and turns are what keep the show running well beyond its years. Even though it might not sound good enough, I recommend at least checking it out and watching the first season."
