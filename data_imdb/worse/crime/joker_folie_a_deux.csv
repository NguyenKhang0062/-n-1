5.0,2 October 2024,"This feels more like a spin-off than a true sequel, spending most of its runtime rehashing the original through court scenes and interviews, rather than pushing the story forward. The writing is serviceable at best, often relying on thin threads to loosely tie one musical dream sequence to the next. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fine, but it lacks the raw intensity that defined his portrayal in the original. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, seemed to intentionally tone down her usual flamboyance, likely to avoid overshadowing him, which, while understandable, feels like a missed opportunity for a more dynamic performance.

The musical numbers, full of energy and spectacle, are easily the highlight of the film, with the singing and dancing offering moments of reprieve from the otherwise sluggish narrative. Unfortunately, these sequences can't sustain the film's momentum. The lack of a substantial plot causes the movie to feel overlong, dragging on for more than two hours, making it feel unnecessarily stretched. Without the gripping psychological tension of its predecessor, the film struggles to find its footing, leaving it more of an indulgent showcase for musical theatrics than a coherent, engaging continuation of the story."

Todd Phillips repeats exactly what he did to The Hangover trilogy with Joker 2. The director goes on to make a sequel that is unfortunately empty and has no character development.

Phillips outdone himself in directing a film that has an outstanding cinematography/visuals that portrays every feeling and emotion that it wants to tell and express. BUT, he failed in creating an engaging storyline. From a part one to a part two, usually the characters of the film change. Their arc either declines or inclines. Their personalities change. Events/obstacles come along their way to shift their lives. OR new character/s enter their life which opens the door for more interesting events to come along their way resulting in a ""Folie à Deux"". In this film, Joker's/Arthur Fleck's life doesn't seem to change much as Gaga's character, Lee, is added. Instead, the film keeps repeating its events by REvisiting the past (the first Joker film) or reacting some of its scenes. It also keeps coming back and forth to the same locations and events within this film itself. Resulting in an overall dull film that is ONLY visually entertaining.

This film introduces two major characters within the Gotham world, Harvey Dent, who is played terribly by Harry Lawtey and written even worse. By the end of the film, I felt like he was useless and is taken advantage of because of his 'name' within the comic books fandom. Same goes to Lady Gaga's Lee that simply felt like it wasn't even in this film.

I enjoyed how this film uses music/songs to showcase that it's an ESCAPE for our inner selves. But, the song choices weren't on point. On the other hand, their performance was well done by Gaga or Joaquin Phoenix and Lawrence Sher's cinematography skills."
1.0,1 October 2024,"I'm so irritated. ""Joker"" was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. It was a raw, dark film that didn't need gimmicks or unnecessary changes to make a statement. So WHY in the world would anyone think it's a good idea to turn ""Joker 2"" into a musical?

This is a slap in the face to fans of the original. We didn't ask for dancing and singing - we wanted more of the same unsettling atmosphere, not a Broadway-style number in the middle of Gotham's madness. I signed up for a continuation of Arthur Fleck's descent into chaos, not a flashy musical break that completely destroys the tone.

The first ""Joker"" was a masterpiece. This sequel choice feels like a desperate attempt to be ""different"" without respecting the core of what made the character and story so compelling. Ridiculous decision.

6.0,1 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux, a sequel that disappoints, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga offer a good performance giving life to two tormented and complex characters. However, it is the story that is full of holes.

While the first film had won us over with its psychological depth and its powerful social criticism, this second chapter seems to struggle to find its own identity. The plot, at times fragmented and predictable, cannot hold its own against its predecessor. The characters, although interesting, remain in the background compared to an action that gets lost in useless digressions.

In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a film that leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, it is often even boring. Despite the technical merits and the excellent performances, the story is weak.

A sequel that disappoints expectations, with a poor plot and a much lower emotional impact than the first film."
3.0,1 October 2024,"Joker 2 attempts to once again dive into the mind of Arthur Fleck, but unfortunately, it treads too much of the same ground as the first film. The original Joker was such a meticulous and thorough character study that by the end, it felt like there was little left to uncover. That exact feeling haunts this sequel, as it struggles to find new dimensions to Arthur's complex psyche, leaving the film feeling more like an epilogue rather than a fresh narrative.

Joaquin Phoenix, as expected, delivers an excellent performance as Arthur Fleck, further cementing his unsettling portrayal of the Joker. Lady Gaga also brings depth to her role as Harley Quinn, adding a new dynamic to Arthur's story. However, the movie continuously pulls away from their strong performances with unnecessary musical numbers and courtroom drama that feel out of place.

Ironically, the movie feels its best when it alludes to the iconic scenes and atmosphere of the first film, rather than when it tries to experiment with new elements. The callbacks to Arthur's lonely and disturbed journey in the original film evoke the same eerie tension and emotional weight that made Joker so powerful. However, the attempts to add new layers with the courtroom drama and out-of-nowhere musical sequences ultimately detract from the story's flow, feeling more like distractions than meaningful additions.

The film shines brightest when it focuses on the twisted and toxic relationship between Joker and Harley. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga adds a fascinating layer to the film, but unfortunately, these moments are too few and far between.

Ultimately, Joker 2 feels more like a continuation that didn't have much more to say. While it has its highlights, particularly in its performances, the film feels like an unnecessary add-on to the first rather than a compelling new chapter. For fans of the original, it might feel redundant, offering little new exploration of Arthur's character or the world he inhabits."
3.0,1 October 2024,"It was a complete waste of time. As a massive fan of Joker, I expected a strong comeback five years later. The movie was a complete drag. Whenever I thought the movie was taking a turn for the better, it got worse. Save yourself the time and money. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was excellent, but the script was terrible. Through no fault of his own, Joker Folie A Deux is in line as one of the worst sequels ever. The movie seemed more like a display of Lady Gaga's singing and acting ability, which isn't great. I believe this may be the biggest box office flop of 2024. This movie should have been released on Tubi for free.

6.0,5 September 2024,"If Joker 2 was meant to expand on the tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck, it succeeded only in expanding my boredom. What made the first film so intriguing-the slow descent into madness-was replaced with a frantic, disjointed attempt to outdo its predecessor without any real sense of direction. Fleck's evolution (or lack thereof) feels more like a series of erratic, isolated scenes than a cohesive narrative.

The film struggles to find its tone, oscillating between forced social commentary and a carnival of absurdity, leaving neither thought-provoking nor entertaining moments to cling to. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more chaos automatically equals more depth, but instead, it comes off as empty spectacle with none of the philosophical grit that made the original resonate. The character development was shallow, almost as if they hoped we wouldn't notice the lack of story under the avalanche of neon-lit chaos and ominous laughs.

Joaquin Phoenix, ever the committed actor, did his best, but even his performance couldn't save a script that feels more like a checklist of provocations than an actual journey. Joker 2 is a poor imitation of its own predecessor, like trying to laugh at the same joke twice-only this time, it falls flat, and you're left wondering why you ever found it funny in the first place.

Verdict? Skip this punchline."
2.0,3 October 2024,"I really wanted this one to be a good movie but..., but I have to be honest this one just didn't land for me. My actual rating would probably be around 4 or 5, but I'm giving it a 6 because I know this film is going to get a lot of negative votes, and it does have some merit.

First off, it felt more like a musical promoting Lady Gaga's ""new album"" than the dark psychological thriller I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, Gaga is talented, and her performance was solid, but the excessive musical numbers really disrupted the mood. This isn't the kind of film where I want to be pulled into a Broadway show mid-story. It just ruins the atmosphere and tension that worked so well in the first Joker movie.

One thing I've never seen before: so many people left the theater before the movie was even over. Unbelievably, I even saw some people fall asleep during the film! The pacing dragged, and it lacked the intense energy that kept the original Joker engaging from start to finish.

On the positive side, the cinematography was beautiful, and Joaquin Phoenix is still excellent as Arthur Fleck. The acting was there, no doubt about that. But even with these strong elements, something was off. The film felt overly long, and by the end, it just seemed to lose direction.

In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux had its moments, but the musical direction and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed."
8.0,1 October 2024,"The height of narcissism in Hollywood arrives in the form of ""Joker: Folie a Deux"", a production that no one asked for, and one that continues the modern day film industries' complete disdain for art, culture, and the consumer. More than one online periodical is arguing that this movie was made with malice towards the Batman franchise, as well as its fans, some news outlets even applauding this decision: hailing it as a ""subversion"" of the superhero genre.

Fans of the comic books and prior Batman movies regard the Joker as the criminal mastermind and complex character he was originally written to be. Those moviegoers are expecting a tense and violent drama, hearty action sequences, and blood and gore. The decision to greenlight a musical and legal procedural Joker sequel is a massive faux pas; one that cannot be excused thru ignorance or even creativity. No, this decision was done knowing the consequences, which are now manifesting as disbelief, anger, frustration and a pathetic box office reception.

One of my acting teachers in Manhattan explained to me that ""America does not want to come home to Medea"", meaning that the average American comes home from a brutal day at work and is received by chores, disobedient children, bills, endless worries and never-ending demands. They want to relax. They want to be entertained. There is a time and place for thoughtful, deeply reflective cinema, and this is not it. -- There is absolutely nothing wrong with a subculture of action movie goers -- They appreciate the fun and excitement the excessive violence causes them to feel. It's fiction and fantasy and has its place in our life as a distraction; one that the incredibly responsible working class deserves.

For Hollywood millionaires and their lackeys to be able to suggest, authorize, produce and distribute such an incredibly pompous and miserly film using a franchise that stands for the exact opposite themes it embodies is a clear sign of an industry gone terribly wrong. An industry that answers to no one and is funded under feigned interest to inform and educate when it clearly patronizes with disdain, untroubled by any repercussions."
6.0,9 October 2024,
1.0,10 October 2024,"In 2019, Todd Phillips' 'Joker' took the world by storm. A moody origin story for the infamous Batman villain- as well as a powerful examination of mental illness- the film grossed over a billion dollars at the box office, and is still the second highest grossing R-rated film of all time. Superbly acted and beautifully shot, the drama- inspired by the films of Martin Scorsese, most evidently 'The King of Comedy' and 'Taxi Driver'- received near unanimous praise, from viewers and critics alike.

However, it was not without some critical controversy. Some writers, like Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, suggested the film was overly sympathetic ""towards white men who commit heinous crimes."" Others, such as Jim Geraghty of National Review, felt that it would encourage ""America's angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men"" to commit crimes like the ones depicted in Phillip's narrative.

Despite this, most concede that the film acted as a poignant, cautionary tale; showing how a societal disregard for the vulnerable can create someone as dangerous as Arthur Fleck, aka: Joker. In this way, it was an important film, that actually had something to say (which the majority of Phillip's previous directorial features largely hadn't). This made it something of a rarity in the landscape of comic-book adaptations- as did the fact that Phillips never intended to follow it up with a sequel.

A rarity and a gamble, for studios want a sure thing. Indeed, it must have been incredibly difficult to get Warner Brothers to pony up the dough for a dark, stand-alone comic book adaptation in the age of the Marvel movie; where certainty is measured by quips, meta-humour and familiarity. That Phillips got 'Joker' made- combined with its whirlwind success- seemed to be a harbinger of sorts; heralding that smaller stories could be just as affecting and as successful as the juggernaut Marvel franchise; proving that not everything actually needs a sequel.

However, in Hollywood need is dictated by profitability; and if anything makes over one billion at the box office, a sequel will surely follow whether viewers, or the filmmakers, necessarily feels one is really warranted.

Hence 'Joker: Folie à Deux,' which, if the original was a gamble, is like a game of Russian Roulette with half the chambers loaded: a very risky business indeed. Whereas the first 'Joker' was a dark psychodrama following Arthur Fleck on his descent into madness, 'Folie à Deux' is a musical, detailing Fleck's struggles with his dual identity in the run up to his trial for murder, alongside his number one fan, fellow inmate and love interest Harleen 'Lee' Quinzel.

Off the bat, credit must be given to Phillips for taking such a risk and going in a new direction, genre-wise. He and fellow screenwriter Scott Silver could have easily rested on their laurels, simply remaking the first film all over again, knowing it was a blueprint for success (as has been happening with the Marvel movies since- what now feels like- the dawn of time). That they decided to make a musical of all things takes genuine guts and, while perhaps foolhardy, must be applauded. It's a massive swing, that not many directors would take.

A massive swing that doesn't exactly result in a hit. The first film had an engaging, tightly plotted narrative, with a compelling central character whose story arc felt organic and real. The sequel feels scattershot in comparison, as if Phillips and Silver weren't sure what to do with Fleck and Quinzel, nor in which direction their story should head. The musical numbers within- and the runtime seems to be at least 50% song and dance- are routinely strong and emotionally resonant, though often feel like padding.

Phillips has stated that Fleck sings when he can't find ""the words to say what he wants to say,"" though, to a cynical viewer, it seems that Fleck sings because Phillips and Silver realized their narrative was too slim to justify a runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. Indeed, much of proceedings are centred on characters recounting events from the first film, or consist of direct flashbacks.

In addition, the idea- hastily introduced at a late stage- that Fleck may not be comfortable being turned into an icon at the expense of his own personality is shoehorned into the cigarette-paper-thin veneer of a plot. This feels at odds with his established character as a whole and, especially, the ending of the first film. Furthermore, the trial sequence- bar an extended scene featuring Gary Puddles, the diminutive clown from the original- is surprisingly dull and forgettable.

Having said that, the doomed central relationship between Fleck and Lee is a genuinely affecting one. There have been on screen relationships between arguably insane characters before- Mickey and Mallory in 'Natural Born Killers' and Lula and Sailor in 'Wild At Heart' come to mind- but rarely are they as grounded and as tender as Fleck and Lee's. Had the narrative around them been stronger, or if he and Silver had been more assured with regard to the film's message; Phillips would have had a great work on his hands.

Unfortunately, as it is, 'Folie à Deux' lacks enough substance to make its own mark, outside the shadow of its predecessor. This is not to say, however, that it doesn't have anything going for it. As mentioned above, the musical numbers are heartbreakingly performed and expertly choreographed. A sequence involving a Sonny & Cher-style variety-show is a stand out, as well as a devastating moment when Fleck recites 'Ne me Quitte pas' into a courthouse phone.

Additionally, Mark Friedberg's production design atmospherically creates a seedy, cold Gotham City, where hope is a rare commodity; and love even rarer. Moreover, Lawrence Sher's striking cinematography recalls the first film, though his use of stylizations and colour makes 'Folie à Deux' a distinct beast; more like the films of Gene Kelly than Martin Scorsese (that Sher has mentioned Francis Ford Coppola's ill-fated musical 'One from the Heart' as inspiration is unsurprising, though also bitterly ironic).

Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Joaquin Phoenix once again powerfully portrays the complexities of a damaged mind, and is electrifying. Intense, nuanced and sadly believable, he carries the film squarely on his shoulders. Lady Gaga does similarly fine work opposite him as Lee, credibly bringing to life a borderline psychotic with aplomb. The madness in her eyes is disconcerting, and she has rarely been better on film. She and Phoenix work well together, performing the various musical numbers masterfully, whether together or apart.

In addition, Brendan Gleeson does typically sterling work as the sadistic prison guard Jackie Sullivan; elevating what many other actors would have played as a straight villain into one of the film's more interesting characters. Catherine Keener impresses greatly as the film's only real 'good' character, Fleck's lawyer Maryanne Stewart, while Harry Lawtey brings the smug DA Harvey Dent to life well; even if the character is as generic as cardboard.

Moreover, Leigh Gill's excellent, impassioned performance as Gary Puddles in the film's best scene lingers long after the credits have rolled, while Zazie Beetz's strong work as Fleck's original love interest Sophie is similarly impressive. Both deserved more screen time. Contrastly, although Steve Coogan has made his bread-and-butter playing smarmy characters, from Alan Partridge to Tony Wilson, his stereotypical American accent as journalist Paddy Meyers is jarring; though he's still effective.

In conclusion, Todd Phillip's 'Joker: Folie à Deux' could potentially have been a great film, were it not for its weak narrative and familiar plotting. Where 2019's 'Joker' ran, it crawls, often straying into the drab territory of the underwhelming. Despite lush cinematography and terrific performances, it comes as a bitter let-down. Although the songs are admittedly well-performed, they fundamentally feel like filler in a film that doesn't know what it wants to be. It is neither as clever nor as controversial as its predecessor and- in comparison, sadly- decidedly disappointing. In the end, although it took guts, why Phillips made the film as a musical is not a folie à deux, rather a folie d'un seul- which makes the joke on the audience."
5.0,1 October 2024,"This was a monumental, brightly burning dumpster fire. If you're a fan of the first one, don't waste your time. It lost the entire spirit and message of the first one.

The first hour was next to pointless and felt like a long, strung out, snoozefest. The second half had a spark of something acceptable, but that dumpster quickly caught fire again and led to one of the worst endings imaginable. Cutting the awful music would've saved 45 minutes of movie.

If the goal was to make a bad movie, it would win film of the year and I swear I gave it to the last frame to be good, but it just fell flat on its face. I'm going to pretend it was never made, and that I didn't waste two hours of my life on this. If you actually want to watch this, wait until it's free.

If I were to say one thing positive, it did have ONE good song and sequence to accompany it, ""Every Deck Has a Joker, and That Joker Is Me"".

Moral of the story is, I'm never going to watch this again."
7.0,3 October 2024,
2.0,1 October 2024,"The sequel to ""Joker"" promised a lot, but the final result fell short of expectations, also a bad movie. The ambitious choice to transform the film into a musical, although bold, was not interesting.

The story does not add anything truly new or original. The relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn, although central to the plot, fails to convince, lacking that emotional depth that could have made it memorable.

Joaquin Phoenix confirms his talent, but his interpretation is also a bit repetitive compared to the first film. Lady Gaga, in the role of Harley Quinn, offers a solid performance, but the character seems crushed by the dominant figure of the Joker.

Ultimately, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a film that leaves a sense of incompleteness, I did not like it. A bad film overall."
6.0,4 October 2024,
4.0,6 October 2024,"I'm shocked at how terrible this film was. I never write reviews but I want to warn people away from wasting their time. Its basically a lady gaga musical featuring the joker, in parts. Terrible. It was very slow and tedious, felt like it topk ages to get into, and then when it did get going, it just as quickly went flat, don't really know what even really happened. Joaquin's acting was obviously fantastic, and lady gaga obviously has a great voice and her acting skills were ok, but that's about it. I'm normally such a fan of the batman and joker franchise, but this was just shocking. I don't know who approved it."
6.0,3 October 2024,"I eagerly waited to watch this movie in IMAX only but it turned out to be super disappointing and boring. Without doubt Joaquin given crazy performance and Lady Gaga's excellent songs. It's okay to have drama and music in crime and action movies, but it was too much and super annoying. She keep singing ""building mountain"" and he is dreaming of her that's all the movie.

There is no seriousness to the storyline and character build, Todd Philips just wanted to keep the audience in curious, but he cheated us with boring and delusional screenplay. He just wasted amazing actors in delusional world without strong conclusion. Most of scenes are easily predictable and laughable."
2.0,5 October 2024,"I absolutely loved the first Joker movie directed by Todd Phillips, but I have to say, what the hell were they thinking when they decided to go into the sequel. Unlike the first film, this movie has practically no story, but rather a series of strange delusional vignettes that were thrown together along with musical numbers that got old very fast and made the run time way longer than needed for how unentertaining it actually was. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a decent performance, but it's nowhere near as good as he was in the first film. I kept waiting in anticipation thinking this must be building towards some big moment that unfortunately never arrives, and instead was left with nothing but disappointment as the movie ends on a worse note than it began.

I was on the fence when I watched the trailer, but now having seen it I kind of wish I wouldn't have. If you're a fan of the first movie, it's a pretty big toss up whether you'll like this one or not, but I wouldn't recommend it."
8.0,3 October 2024,
6.0,16 October 2024,"The pressure ($$$) on Todd Phillips and Scott Silver after ""Joker"" (2019) must have been intense to ""just do it again."" It's in the nature of capitalism that if you're not growing, you're shrinking. But the reason for the success of the first film seems to have escaped the notice of Joaquin Phoenix, Phillips, Silver and Warner Brothers. Arthur Fleck was presented as a sort of Everyman: he was concerned about his mental and physical health and that of his aging mother, liked TV and thought of his favorite TV host as a friend, found affirmation in the arms of another lonely person, the single mother who lived down the hall, was a victim of street crime, struggled with the pigeon-holing tendencies of bureaucracy, sought to please his employer and get along with co-workers, needed money and strove to improve his job skills, wished to reconcile with his estranged father, and tried to protect a woman being bullied in a subway car. In short, he was like us. Until he blew his stack! Understandable. (Seemingly prescient, it was followed by mass rioting and general arson in Minneapolis, Seattle, etc.) This sequel is entirely different: it's about a singer/dancer, networking with another singer/dancer (Lady Gaga). That's not us; we don't do that. What the quartet above seems to have missed is that the suburban matrons flocking to Broadway shows were not the audience that made ""Joker"" boffo. The new film is as divorced from reality as the previous film was rooted in it. Kudos to Oscar winner Hildur Guanadottir for trying to hold it together with her music, but it's to no avail."
1.0,4 October 2024,
1.0,2 October 2024,"Todd Phillips is a masterclass director, directing some of the highest grossing films of all times like The Hangover. Joker (2019) was no exception to this, being the highest grossing restricted movie of all time at time of release. I was lucky enough to snag two tickets to a premiere in my area for Joker: Folie a Deux, and I left the theatre more disappointed than I anticipated. All of the ingredients were there to make a good recipe, and somehow, this movie came out of the oven tasteful but insanely dry.

The film follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) after the events of Joker (2019). He now has a devoted fanbase outside of his imprisonment at Arkham Asylum, and has even made friends with fellow guards and prisoners. Upon being upgraded to a minimum watch zone within the penitentiary, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a superfan who has devoted her life to following Arthur's mentality. Together, they devise a plan to get them both out of jail where they can eventually live a happy life together, but at the cost of putting the Gotham in danger.

Heres what the movie does right: the direction and cinematography. Being a direction nerd, I was so taken aback by the beauty of some of the shots in this film. Please see this on the biggest screen you can. I saw it in an IMAX theatre and it was so beautiful to behold. Phillips knows exactly what he's doing with these shots and what they are adding to the story. Also, the performances. Gaga, as always, never fails to surprise me with her acting abilities. Phoenix, reprising his oscar-winning role, hasn't lost sight of the character at all, and once again wowed me, a similar, slightly less scared, feeling as when i left the theatre to Joker (2019). The production and scenic design were also great as always, but we knew that going in. Especially knowing that this is indeed a musical, they really went for it.

Heres what I perhaps didn't like as much: 2 main factors. The musicality, and the script. I love a good musical; some of my favourite movies are musicals. In this movie, the music felt so forced and not needed. I got exactly what they were trying to do with the numbers, and some worked (If my friends could see me now, Oh when the saints). But a lot of them just felt like filler in a rather empty movie. Which brings it into the next major point, the script. This movie has no clue what it wants to be. Its mostly a courtroom drama that has an outcome anyone could see coming, and also jumps the shark with less than 10 minutes left in the runtime. Phillips doesn't trust the audience to have either seen the first one, nor follow any DC lore. Lee Quinzel, obviously an anagram for another very famous DC villain, feels completely underwritten in this movie. We have zero clue who she is and when we see her character for the final time, you still don't really have a clue who she is. Harvey Kent plays a pretty main role in this film, and anyone knowing batman knows exactly who Harvey Kent is, who he becomes, and what his intentions are. It wasn't shocking. Nothing surprised me with this movie, which is so sad because the first one left my spine tingling. That was the most unfortunate part once the credits started to roll.

Overall, this movie is indeed watchable, but after coming off of such a high from the first movie, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. It's not bad by any means, in fact, I enjoyed it more than I didn't. But I really dont think this movie got to the apex it needed to, but it got 70% there. I predict it will get big but not the levels of Joker (2019)"
7.0,1 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux was a huge disappointment. The movie failed to capture the essence of the Joker character, feeling more like a hollow follow-up than a meaningful sequel. Harley Quinn's introduction brought no impact or depth, and her presence felt unnecessary rather than complementary. The story lacked the intensity and psychological complexity that made the first Joker film so compelling. Honestly, it didn't feel like a Joker film at all !!! It should have been titled something else because it didn't represent what fans expect from the Joker universe... I'm sure lots of people will leave the movie from the half because the story is not moving forward at all !!"
4.0,5 September 2024,When Joker came out it changed cinema and the way people perceive the character. It transcended new themes and emotions associated with the legendary villain. It also gave way to Joaquin's best performance and Todd's best direction. It reaped a billion dollars at the box office on top if that. As time passed the inevitable sequel and the ideas were gaining traction. Ultimately it led to Lady Gaga being cast as Harley Quinn which was met with backlash as we knew they would make it a musical. Well they did and they made a Mockery of the entire property . It's as if Phillips wanted to pull a 180 on the entire first film and troll the fans . This is NOT a Joker film . This is a parody. Absolutely heinous and not even Joaquin could save it. The worst sequel I've ever seen.
7.0,1 October 2024,"Performance of the actors is good, but the film's script is terrible. Joker 2 is a bad sequel. Is the exact description of the film. The actors are good but the film remains an ugly and boring film that I will not see again, I only had to see it once and that was it, I didn't like it. I don't even recommend it because I don't think it's a good film, so I don't recommend it. Often making sequels is a risk, and in this case the sequel is unsuccessful, not because of the actors but because of a bad script. Not recommended, those who saw the first Joker film will be very disappointed, it is a pointless sequel."
1.0,4 October 2024,"I interpreted, like the previous one, it is about mental health issues. However, in this film, specifically, it seeks to make deeper reflections on what is a pathology and what is pure human evil. Who is the demon? Fleck? Joker? Or the humankind? I thought the musical was a little exaggerated, it could have been toned down a little by the director. I found some out of time. The first film was better. I think the second could be better tied and constructed. The film is also very surprising and makes the viewer think a lot. Many may have left thinking that they watched a disjointed film, but I think this is one of those that you have to watch at least twice for you to understand."
7.0,5 October 2024,"Before watching the movie, I avoided reading reviews or watching trailers because I had incredibly high expectations. With stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, I was hoping for an intense and profound portrayal of the Joker-a character known for his dark, complex, and psychopathic nature.

While Phoenix and Gaga give solid performances, the film falls flat in delivering the story we all wanted. Instead of diving deep into the Joker's twisted psyche, we're given an odd mix of musical numbers and dance sequences that feel out of place, often popping up every few minutes without any real purpose. The Joker's torment, his darkness, and his complexity-all of that is missing.

What makes it worse is that we all know this isn't the *real* Joker from the comics or earlier films. But even with that freedom, the movie wastes the potential to explore the more psychological, chaotic side of the character. Instead, we're left with a shallow version of what could've been a gripping dive into madness.

The supporting characters, like Harley Quinn (played by Gaga), are equally underserved. Instead of playing into their notorious, toxic dynamic, her character feels one-dimensional, with little depth to their connection. The lack of meaningful interaction between the Joker and figures like Murray Franklin or even Arkham inmates drains the story of any tension or intrigue.

It's a real shame because, with the right direction, this could've easily been one of the best films of the year. Instead, it's a disappointment. Save yourself the time and money-this one doesn't live up to the hype."
2.0,4 October 2024,"I can see why people don't like this film. However those wanting a repeat of the first film will be very disappointed. This film is a complete reverse of the first film where we saw Arthur Fleck grow into Joker. This film dismantles all of that, and our expectations. The cinematography and lighting is incredible as is the acting, aside from Steve Coogan who jars but even Alan Partridge pronunciations are picked up by Arthur! Gaga Iis brilliant and so is Gleason as a hatedul prison guard. This is not the film people want but is is the one they f""""""inf deserve and I for one loved it, musical numbers and all!"
8.0,1 October 2024,"When you watch a movie that you don't understand the meaning of, a movie that after watching it you basically think is useless. This is the sequel to Joker. I honestly expected something much better, I'm disappointed, I can't understand the reason for the movie, there's almost nothing that surprised me. Maybe the only feeling I really felt during the movie was boredom. I wonder if there was really a need for a Joker sequel, in my opinion no, in fact this disappointing sequel confirms my opinion. Sometimes it's better to stick with one film rather than have disappointing sequels like this film."
7.0,4 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" is a movie that will be remembered as one of the most creative and realistic sequels, closely tied to the origin story. Many viewers might expect a lot of sensational elements in the second part, but that's not what Todd Phillips aimed for, and he deserves credit for that. Without giving too much away, the character arc in ""Joker 2"" is portrayed beautifully, reminding the audience that they shouldn't expect Joker to commit crimes like in the first movie, as he is now in a different setting, being in a trial environment. Lady Gaga gives an outstanding performance, significantly influencing Joker's psychological struggles and decisions about his identity. Don't miss the first five minutes, featuring a WB cartoon that perfectly sets the tone for the next two hours. Overall, the movie's message, once again highlights, why most of the audience tends to look for sensational moments, instead of understanding the character's mental health journey. The climax, justifies the very reason for this movie's existence from Todd. Hats off to Todd, Joaquin, Hildur, and Gaga! Wishing the team many more Oscar nominations."
1.0,2 October 2024,"I was absolutely speechless at how terrible the movie was. I sat in the theater and waited-and waited-for something to happen, but all I got was a deep sense of disappointment shoved right in my face. I had truly been looking forward to this film after the first **Joker**, which was fantastic, but this? It's almost as if they made an active effort to ruin everything that made the first one great. There was massive potential waiting to be explored, but the film managed to crush my expectations with a precision that should be studied by film students worldwide.

This film isn't just bad-it's a complete insult to fans. It's an enormous waste of time and energy, and it left me practically angry for wasting two hours on something so soulless and empty. Calling it ""boring"" doesn't even begin to cover it-it was painfully uninspired. How they even had the audacity to call this a **Joker** film is a mystery in itself. They should be ashamed for releasing such a disaster in 2024. Honestly, who on earth greenlit this mess?

They need to rethink their entire approach to filmmaking, because this wasn't just a disappointment-it was a catastrophe. Shame on them!"
1.0,4 October 2024,
6.0,1 October 2024,"Believe me I would have loved to praise Joker Folie Á Deux as a cinematic masterpiece - like the first Joker film. I really would have. But unfortunately it is not.

The main problem is the storyline. Despite of +2 hours runtime the plot can be retold in four short sentences. There really is not much to it. Sadly, because there was so much potential for shaping Arthur Fleck into the supervillain from the Batman franchise and complete the best origin story ever made.

When you look at Joker: Folie Á Deux as an independent movie - and we have to, right? - there is barely no development in the plot. Almost no progression. It feels more like a brief postscript to the first film, than like a story in its own right. Like it is living on all the qualities we remember from Joker and not really taking us any further - not telling a new story.

It could have been so great. Building on the storyline from the first film with its public riots. Where the rage and the anger was rising from the filthy city gutters. The poor, the working class and the mentally ill to start a rebellion against the rich and the powerful in Gotham City. Led by The Joker ultimately entering organized crime. A layered and complex story like a major jigsaw puzzle slowly assembled to fit in perfectly with the Batman universe. This element is totally missing in Folie Á Deux.

All right then. Acting is still spectacular. Singing is great too. Arthur Fleck is the perfect protagonist. Brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix making the rise of the most unbelievable yet legendary cartoon supervillain a very human, emotional and social realistic story. All love and respect for the immensely talented Joaquin Phoenix acting with so much emotion and charisma - maybe the greatest actor alive.

However, he cannot save this film which somehow seems fitted to Lady Gaga to quite a large extent. It's a musical, and basically half the runtime takes place in the imagination of Arthur Fleck reflecting his profound love for the theatrical performance - and maybe continuing his tendency to engage in imaginary relationships? However, the singing scenes really don't drive the story forward. They convey emotions. But they are sort of irrelevant with regard to the plot progression.

One more problem: In the singing scenes Lady Gaga sometimes make it seems like, Joker is redundant and the only thing Joaquin Phoenix can do is raising eyebrows and averting his eyes. She steals the picture - for no reason other than ""we want some songs in the movie"".

I hate saying this: But honestly, it gets boring on the way. I could not help but sigh with irritation when they began singing for the seventh time. The social realistic story of Arthur Fleck continues in the musical Folie Á Deux. But the sophisticated and intelligent origin story to the Batman universe got lost on the way."
1.0,1 October 2024,
6.0,5 October 2024,"I was determined to be open-minded and optimistic about a Joker musical, especially with a pair of lungs like Lady Gaga involved, but I'm sorry to say that Joker Folie å Deux is a misfire of epic proportions, fully deserving of the hatred it has been receiving. I'm not averse to musicals in general, only when the singing is terrible, and Joaquin Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a basket - Gaga can only do so much, and even she is given little opportunity to shine, only occasionally belting out the tunes like we know she can.

Add the fact that the plot is stupefyingly dull - part dreary prison story, part boring courtroom drama - and what you have is the sequel that no-one wanted. The themes are the same as the first film - madness, mental illness, societal collapse etc. - but the execution is so left-field as to alienate the established fan base. It's an undeniably gutsy move to make something so completely different, but there's something to be said for the old adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' - especially when your leading man is so musically challenged.

1/10 - quite possibly the worst film of the year.

N. B. The projectionist seemed unable to get the picture in focus at the screening I saw, but I couldn't be bothered to get up and say something. If the film had been better it might have been worth the effort."
2.0,5 September 2024,"The story falls flat due to weak writing. While a few scenes are dramatically well-executed, they fail to captivate the audience, making the movie feel tedious from the start. The progression in both writing and direction is lacking, raising the question of whether a sequel was necessary in the first place.

Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers a remarkable performance, but it is difficult to fully appreciate or enjoy it given the film's flaws.

Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is underwhelming.

Even Todd Phillips' competent direction does little to elevate the movie.

I don't recommend watching this film. Instead, revisit the original ""Joker,"" or better yet, check out the Indian mini Web Series ""BRINDA"" - you'll thank me later."
7.0,3 October 2024,"This movie had the potential to be a great follow-up to its predecessor, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an outstanding performance, elevating every scene he's in, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the same standard. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck remains deeply compelling, and if it weren't for his commitment to the role, the film would have been much harder to sit through.

The story, however, felt disjointed and left far too many questions unanswered. It seemed as though much of the narrative either stalled or was confined to the courtroom, creating a repetitive structure that lacked forward momentum. We barely learned anything new about the characters or their motivations, particularly Lee. There was so much potential to explore her backstory, but instead, her character felt one-dimensional, like she was just upset over a bad breakup, which felt underwhelming and incomplete.

Lady Gaga's performance lacked the depth and emotional intensity that the role demanded, making her character feel flat and uninspiring. Given the complex, chaotic nature of the Joker's world, this lack of dynamism felt like a major missed opportunity.

Overall, this movie could have been great. With Joaquin Phoenix's talent and the rich potential of the Joker character, there was a real chance to dive deep into compelling, gritty storytelling. Instead, the movie opted for a repetitive plot and underdeveloped characters, making it fall short of its potential."
1.0,2 October 2024,"I'm going to keep this short. The whole movie was slow and the fact that they turned it into a musical is a compete joke. I was suffering through the whole movie just thinking to myself, when does it actually get good?

Towards the end there was a scene where I thought Now is the time that the movie will redeem itself, but it never came and took a 180 and ended it in one of the worst endings ever to such a masterpiece that was the first movie.

Knowing how much I anticipated the sequel I could not even consider not watching it, but knowing what I know now all I can say to curious fans of the first one is to NOT watch this absolute waste of a movie."
10.0,14 October 2024,"I think this film has a good idea and it's clear that a lot of effort was put into it, I just think they didn't keep in mind what made people love the first one. People love the character of the Joker and enjoyed seeing a fresh take on his origin story.

The point this second film seems to hammer home is that ""The Joker"" persona Arthur Fleck has is bad and so are his followers, and they decided to show this by making the story about Arthur eventually wanting to ditch the persona. This might have worked a bit better if we got to actually see ""The Joker"" in action, we only really see Arthur as himself for the majority of the film which seems like a bit of a wasted opportunity. I feel like people would've loved a film showing ""The Joker"" be ""The Joker"" and whilst I know the first film purposely doesn't lean into that side of the character, the implications of a follow up film make you think it's going to be focusing on the new alter ego.

I actually liked the idea of Arthur needing to get his Joker persona back after losing it in prison, and I liked how Harley Quinn's obsession with his persona was the catalyst for it to come back, I liked the dynamic between the two throughout and I even didn't mind the musical aspect of the film, I just think this arc should have been a lot shorter and should've led to him being The Joker for the majority of the film.

Overall, for me I don't think the film is awful, I think it just wasted the potential to develop the Joker persona rather than the character of Arthur. We didn't really need to be told that The Joker is a bad guy, we knew that after the first one. But the fact that his story is that tragic you feel bad for him added to the complexity of his alter ego. You know he's gone down the wrong path, but you know what made him snap.

It's somewhere between a 5 and 6, but I've gone with 6 for now because I enjoyed the style and tone of the film and the care put into it, it might change though."
6.0,9 October 2024,"I wish this movie was never made. It kinda started interesting, with Arthur in the prison, but after less than an hour it was obvious that there was no story at all and Lady Gaga was basically acting herself. At one point it felt like I was watching a super long Lady Gaga music video. I felt disappointed and angry when I left the theatre. Waste of my time and money.

Two stars because of Joaquin Phoenix, who is an amazing actor and did his best, even though the script was horrible. I wonder if he thought making the film was a good idea, after reading the script and knowing it was going to be a musical."
2.0,9 October 2024,"Firstly: this film is the epilogue that we didn't need. But, as sequels go, it was a contextually appropriate sequel and complements the first film.

The Folie a Deux is more intelligent, nuanced and meta to the larger DC universe - but I won't say more than that.

The second half does sag a little as the courtroom drama takes centre stage and distracts from the solid first hour. The sagging second half then makes the finale feel rushed even though the end is fitting for the story arc.

A good film that is overshadowed by its predecessors, but overshadows most other films currently in cinemas."
1.0,1 October 2024,"This is by far the worst Joker movie ever made !! An absolute flop and a massive disappointment. I can't believe what I just watched! After waiting 4-5 years, this is the movie the directors came up with? The entire film was painfully boring, with most of it set inside a dull, lifeless jail. The Joker, a character known for chaos and unpredictability, was reduced to sitting in a cell for nearly the whole runtime. There was no excitement, no creativity-just a dragged-out, monotonous plot. I expected so much more, but this felt like a complete waste of time.

I have nothing against for musical type of movies, but you can't make this Joker movie this boring and show him this poor character."
7.0,5 October 2024,"I have seen a lot of peoples bad reviews, and I get why typical comic/marvel fans don't like this movie. For people who like more cookie-cutter plots and familiar storylines, this movie will disappoint. I however, loved it! This is good art, every scene is masterfully shot, and the theme in the movie plays deeply on emotions. Acting is just fantastic. I cried, laughed and sat with an open jaw, just amazed by how the movie is filmed, how every scene was so beautifully put together. I generally don't like musicals, but in this movie it just works.

For people more mentally oriented, worrying about how this movie connects to other DC movies and want to feel the same generic and familiar theme as most other comic movies - this is not for you. The emotional story is part of this movies genius, filled with deep empathy, love, sadness, vulnerability and joy."
1.0,1 October 2024,
7.0,6 September 2024,"Joker was one of the biggest popular movies in 2019 which has spawned memes, influences, and word of mouth amongst fans and others. Director Todd Philips crafts the story of Joker and Harley Quinn and the romance surrounding them but despite it's production, costumes, and performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga being solid, Joker: Folie à Deux ends up falling into issue of style over substance which causes the movie fall into the lines of: pretentious filmmaking.

Joker was a solid movie that has some interesting themes and concepts while being slightly bloated with itself. Unfortunately, this sequel ends up being a bit too full of itself with its simple narrative that ends up making it's themes feel bloated, predictable, and honestly, uninteresting. The atmosphere, musical score, production, and style tries to make it seem the narrative is better and greater, however, as a whole, the narrative is really messy and basic which really drags the movie down and makes it feel like a bore fest. On the musical score, the musical score is solid but the singing was mostly alright and the songs are pretty forgettable.

The characters of Joker and Harley have some interesting charm and dynamics between them, but despite the strong performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the laughably dialogue, uninteresting side characters, and tone that takes itself WAY too seriously doesn't do much justice. Including Philips' direction being kind of all over the place.

Philips really tries to grasp hard to move away from the derivative comedy movies in his past career and lean into dramatic works but unfortunately, he seems to fail to stray away from it.

At the end, Todd Philips tries to make something serious but unfortunately fails to successfully strive with a dramatic tale."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Joker Folie a Deux... Or just Joker 2 for normal people, is a completely unneeded sequel, that got made by Todd Phillips.

He decided to shred and spit on his original, praised movie, to cut himself away from the ""toxicity of Joker"".

Joker in this movie goes back to miserable Arthur Fleck, who is emasculated, ridiculed and humiliated for most of the movie. He has no agency in his movie, he is just there as the events take place around him, and when he finally gets his moment it just ends with one of the dumbest decisions he could've made.

The ending is the ultimate end to Joker franchise by Todd Phillips, like he wanted to make a statement about his first movie and to be perfectly sure nobody in WB will ever ask him to make another one.

Movie is a boring slog, with no story, no character development, musical scenes being just there out of nowhere - just because we have Lady Gaga on screen, who is a good actress by the way, but almost everything involving Gaga is a musical, and she gets no way to actually act.

Todd Phillips already showed us that he is bad at sequels with The Hangover movies - but still there was some enjoyment to be had with 2 and 3... and especially with 2.

This is an insult to the fans, to the Joker and to the cast who tried their best with the crappy material they were given. Especially Leigh Gill as Little Gary who's scene is probably the only good scene in the entire movie."
6.0,7 October 2024,
2.0,4 October 2024,"The original Joker was a dark, gritty exploration of mental illness and societal decay. It was a critical and commercial success, leaving audiences stunned and disturbed. However, its sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is a disappointing departure from the original's success. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a baffling one that completely undermines the tone and themes established in the first film.

The musical numbers in Joker: Folie à Deux feel forced and out of place. They disrupt the narrative and detract from the film's overall atmosphere. The songs are often generic and forgettable, failing to add anything meaningful to the story. Additionally, the musical style clashes with the film's dark subject matter, creating a jarring dissonance that is difficult to ignore.

Beyond the musical elements, Joker: Folie à Deux suffers from a lack of compelling storytelling. The plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. The film fails to capture the same intensity and emotional depth as its predecessor. The pacing is slow and the dialogue is often clunky and contrived.

The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. It feels rushed and unsatisfying, leaving many questions unanswered. The conclusion is a far cry from the shocking and thought-provoking ending of the original film. It is a letdown that leaves the viewer feeling cheated and unsatisfied.

In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a significant disappointment. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a major miscalculation that undermines the film's tone and themes. The storytelling is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the ending is unsatisfying. Fans of the original film will likely be left feeling disappointed and confused by this misguided sequel."
10.0,7 October 2024,"People were expecting the first movie, and its not that good. But how likely would it be able to reach that height? It's not bad, but its worth seeing. People have complained about the music not fitting the scene, which is not true. Complaints of it just rehashing the first movie are fair criticisms. The complaints about no story or plot, are not fair complaints. The focus of the movie is the toxic love between Joker and Harley, and this movie plays with the standard weight of Joker being the more toxic aspect of their relationship. I think people don't understand that, most people don't understand that Harley and Joker are not a healthy couple. There is also going to be people who are sour on the ending, and the implications that are possibly made, which I won't spoil, but they are also fair complaints."
6.0,11 October 2024,"10 minutes in I was fairly certain I'd made a mistake coming to see this movie. Half an hour later I was absolutely certain it wasn't going anywhere. I would have left then but couldn't go home until the pavement paint had dried so I could get back in. After an hour and twenty minutes (run time 2hr 18min) I couldn't take any more, my head was about to burst, the film was still no further ahead . It was only when I got home that I realised I should have stayed home and watched the paint dry. It really is that bad. I don't know where this movie was going but after an hour and a half I really. Didn't care. Save some money, Save your sanity, stay at home. If you need entertainment throw some paint on the wall and watch it dry. I promise you won't be any more disappointed."
1.0,4 October 2024,"The moment that they announced there will be a second movie for Joker, and Lady Gaga is going to appear as Harley Quinn, i thought that it would be a movie similar to Suicide Squad but with better acting performances and more dramatic scenes. And i was sure of it when i watched the trailers and saw Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix in prison on that scene Lady Gaga told him to ""let's get out of here"". But today i have been shocked because it had nothing to do with the violent Joker and Harley Quinn that we all knew. I have rated it with 6 just because i really liked the acting performances of Joaquin and Lady Gaga but i didn't expect it to be that much dramatic."
1.0,12 October 2024,"I'll save you a couple of hours of your life that you won't get back if you decide to watch this film.

Go to YouTube and look for ""Simpsons Paint Your Wagon"" and in just a couple of minutes you will experience everything the movie has to offer without actually sacrificing a couple of hours of your life.

If the red flag of low quality for a Batman film is the presence of Robin, then I'm sad to say that the same thing can now be applied to Joker with Harley Quinn.

A sequence of boring courtroom scenes frequently interrupted by forced and pointless light hearted musical numbers. As forced as the arguments pointing at areas or depth and meaning of people trying to defend this film. The film is boring, plain and simple .."
6.0,6 October 2024,
2.0,1 October 2024,"First, I saw it as part of my AMC membership. (If I see another movie this month, my membership is covered and all other movies are free.) Those who paid to see it shelled out $17. I would NOT recommend spending that much money. Also, I can't think of anything that happened on screen that justifies IMAX.

I appreciated how they incorporated the musical elements. I wouldn't call it a musical in the Broadway sense, although there were some nods to that. The songs did reflect the emotions of the characters and weren't just plopped in to do musical numbers.

The story does pick up from the first movie. In fact, several of the questions about the first movie were answered satisfactorily (at least to me). Unfortunately, I think this diminished the mystique (at least to me) of Joker himself. I did not care about him, or his journey, as much as I did in the first movie.

I've got to say, though, that this ain't your Hollywood ending. Something is thrown in in the last scene that dropped my jaw.

This isn't a movie you go to to be entertained. It provokes thought and discussion. At this screening, a group in the first row turned around and asked the rest of the audience what we thought. I put my head down and walked out because I wasn't sure what I thought. I'm still trying to figure it out. That makes it a movie worth seeing but not for full price."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I'm tired of movies crossing the border between fantasy and idiocy. This is a perfect example. Sure, it's a comic book movie but throughout the entire movie there is basically no law enforcement anywhere. It's ridiculous.

Then we come in and add Lady Gaga. Are you serious? Is she supposed to be like some kind of actress that we are going to look to for a miraculously amazing performance?

She sucks. Stick to singing.

I think the movie would have been much better had it not contained her. She is just not an actress that I want to see in a Marvel or DC movie. She is a singer.

For the rest of the movie, The joker runs around singing and dancing and basically avoiding every possible scenario where he could be apprehended by police. The whole thing is a big mess."
1.0,12 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a significant departure from what many of us might expect, and not necessarily in a good way. The film, which many anticipated to be an action-packed follow-up to the original Joker, instead takes an unexpected turn into the realm of musical adaptation. This shift in genre is likely to leave a lot of viewers disappointed, especially those who were hoping for a continuation of the gritty, intense atmosphere that made the first movie so compelling.

One of the most glaring issues with Joker: Folie à Deux is the lack of action. The original Joker was praised for its raw and visceral portrayal of violence and chaos, elements that are conspicuously absent in this sequel. Instead of the adrenaline-pumping scenes that fans were looking forward to, the movie is filled with musical numbers that feel out of place and disrupt the narrative flow. The action sequences, when they do appear, are few and far between, and they lack the intensity and impact that made the first film so memorable.

The decision to turn Joker: Folie à Deux into a musical is baffling. While musicals have their own charm and can be incredibly engaging, this genre does not suit the dark and brooding world of the Joker. The musical numbers feel forced and detract from the overall tone of the film. Instead of enhancing the story, they serve as a distraction, pulling viewers out of the immersive experience that the first movie so expertly crafted. The songs themselves are not particularly memorable, and the choreography feels uninspired, further diminishing the impact of these scenes."
7.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,4 October 2024,"It feels like Todd Phillips hates that people really liked the first movie. It's as if he thought that anyone that liked Joker wanted to BE Joker. No Todd, the audience is smarter than that. You made an interesting empathetic character where we learn how a man could commit such evil acts. You feel bad for Arthur but we're not excusing his actions. Yet, some of those that didn't like the first thought you were promoting that behavior. Maybe, don't listen to the people that misunderstood your first movie Todd because it seems like that rhetoric steered your decision making in this sequel.

Technically, this movie does a lot right. The acting, score, cinematography, etc. Is all good. Heck, even a couple of the musical numbers are good. The idea of a musical has some potential, while not necessarily a take I'd go, a couple parts show how it could have been very interesting. The movie never commits to it though. So most of the singing feels routine and dull. Ultimately, the writing drags this movie down.

Obviously, there was no plan for a direct sequel to Joker, but it was a huge success, therefore WB offers a big paycheck to Todd Phillips to make a sequel. So he creates a movie that no fan of the first movie wanted. Todd gets the last laugh because he's now richer and the punchline is the audience who spent their money to see this movie he knew most wouldn't like. Get it, it's meta, you shouldn't like this stuff, not what you expected, gotcha!"
10.0,17 October 2024,"I loved the first film, and have the utmost respect for Mr. Phillips and this largely great cast, but this was a serious bomb.

The recipe for a successful sequel is to ideally take whatever worked about the story and characters within the first film, and elaborate on it. This way, the audience with whom the film resonated have some sense of momentum or arc to move forward with. What this movie did was the opposite. Instead of taking what made its predecessor great and expanding upon it, it wags its finger in the face of those who appreciated what the first film accomplished. This is is hardly a way to turn a profit with your sequel, but we live in ""interesting"" times, and after viewing this laughably bad follow-up, I'm convinced of one of two things: either Todd Phillips felt his first film was misconstrued by the masses, and he willfully wanted to clarify, or he's been pressured by forces within Hollywood to create a sequel that is antithetical to the original movie.

What made ""Joker"" great was that we got to go along with a man's descent into outlaw madness thanks to a modernity that forces us to the edge. It was cathartic and powerful. This recent addition is a slap to the face, and is the perfect example of how to ruin a budding franchise.

While Joaquin Phoenix is again great, and the movie is well edited, this is one I will not ever revisit. It's an epic fail."
7.0,2 October 2024,"It's hard to understand why they turned it into a musical, which only adds confusion. It is annoying how the movie tried to be anything but boring (at least for me). Phoenix and Cinematography are amazing but they can't save the movie. The script throws everything into a bad experience. So sorry.

Synopsis: ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.

1.0,5 October 2024,"This sequel to the 2019 masterpiece should never have been made. Joker is one of the best movies ever made and the only comic book movie to win best actor at the Oscars. But with this ""sequel"" they completely destroyed what they had built 5 years ago and they seem to have forgotten the personality of the comic book character itself who's one of the most iconic villains of the action comics genre. They should present this movie with a special Oscar for ""Worst sequel ever made"". I wasted my money and weekend over this, and I had been looking forward to watch it ever since it was announced. The enormous number of bad reviews this movie had received was hard to believe until I watched it and now I add to that number with this review."

I love the music and the dancing but I wish they made less music with more serious scenes.

Joaquin Phoenix doesnt have the same impact on acting as in the first one.. most of the time Lady gaga is singing or putting joker into second acting as a fragile, pathetic and lame charather. 5 years waiting for a epic movie but they give you a cry baby joker that follows this ""Harley-Quinn"" instead of the opposite... and even the final of the movie is completing mind-blowing not in a good way. My money and time was wasted."
1.0,6 October 2024,"I really like Joker: Folie à Deux for what it is, not for what people expected it to be. It's not just a sequel to Joker. What I appreciate most is seeing the complexity of Arthur's troubled mind and exploring the depths of his character, as well as Lee's. The film focuses on Arthur's journey, and the music fits perfectly, making the experience even more emotional. It feels like the soundtrack was made to reflect his inner struggles, adding more to the story.

I loved how the movie isn't afraid to be different or take risks. It continues Arthur's story in a way that shows more of what's going on inside him, which kept me really interested. It's a special movie, and I like that it stays true to itself instead of trying to meet what people expected."
7.0,7 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a bold sequel that delves deeper into Arthur Fleck's fractured psyche, with Joaquin Phoenix reprising his Oscar-winning role and Lady Gaga joining as Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Directed by Todd Phillips, the film ambitiously incorporates musical elements, adding a unique layer that may feel disjointed at times but showcases Gaga's musical talent. Phoenix's portrayal remains a masterclass, while Gaga's transformation into Harley Quinn is gradual and captivating. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and Hildur Guðnadóttir's haunting score enhance the psychological tension, making this film a daring and artistically ambitious follow-up deserving of higher acclaim, even if the musical flourishes might not resonate with all viewers."
1.0,8 October 2024,"Seriously, who thought a musical sequel was a good idea? They ruined a perfect movie with stupid singing and dancing. It's like they forgot what made the first one great. This is a joke, not a movie.

The original Joker was a dark, gritty masterpiece that explored the depths of mental illness and societal decay. The sequel, however, is a complete departure from that tone. The introduction of musical numbers feels forced and out of place, disrupting the film's narrative and destroying the atmosphere that made the first movie so compelling.

The idea of turning a serious drama into a musical is a risky one that ultimately doesn't pay off. Musical films require strong songs and a well-crafted narrative to be successful. Joker 2 fails on both counts. The songs are forgettable, and the plot is weak.

The performances in Joker 2 are also a mixed bag. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance, the rest of the cast feels underwhelming. The supporting characters are one-dimensional and fail to make a lasting impression.

In conclusion, Joker 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. The introduction of musical elements is a significant misstep that undermines the film's narrative and tone. While the original Joker was a masterpiece, Joker 2 is a forgettable mess."
6.0,3 October 2024,"When you watch the first movie and then you watch this, you'll feel like La La Land's director made this one, everyone is singing and dancing, like Joker's director was drunk, and wanted to make a sequel of La La Land but. Fooling people, made a senseless movie just for earning free money, looting people honestly, by showing garbage. Director wanted to show garbage, so he made garbage, ruined characters and actors image, Lady gaga was a disappointment, 90% senseless movie in name of art, Showing a court drama, jail break and stupid dancing make it even more irritating, I wish I could get my money back. Don't go to theatre for this torture."
2.0,16 October 2024,"I watched the movie twice. I guess I must be a masochist. I truly wanted to believe that people on here and elsewhere ' missed the point' or maybe there was some hidden masterpiece to be unveiled & appreciated. But that was a ' fantasy' I had created & now I've left then fantasy comprehensively.

The first joker debases the joker archetype, but we are given the mental health struggle of the character representing Arthur Fleck. It was a movie that emerged us in the complexities & nuances of DID or schizophrenia/psychosis.

In the second movie we see no redemption of Arthur Fleck. He goes through even more extreme humiliation . It is clearly spelt out he has DID with childhood trauma.

But I can't help feeling that this movie just leaves you with a feeling of disgust. It's like it wanted to turn the viewer into the victim instead tell the story or present it in a way to deliver its message.

I'm not sure where the director was going with this one? Joker character was debased. Arthur Fleck as a human was debased. The justice system & society debased. I can only say the intention behind the movie was demoralisation like a back handed compliment or endless negging for 2hrs 18 mins. I don't want to be in an abusive relationship with a movie. I will give credit to the director because he probably has waken up people to just how messed up Holywood is with the scandals that keep coming out."
9.0,8 October 2024,"Folie à Deux's low audience score is not surprising at all, considering the film doesn't appear to be for any audience just interested in a possible Joker's sequel. It blows up the premise of the first story so completely, it won't appeal to fans of the 2019 film. It rejects any kind of accuracy, so it's not for the fans. Lady Gaga is a highlight and Phoenix perfect as usual, but overall the effect is restricted by the poor material. Joker: Folie à Deux seems to be the rare movie that very few people will actually enjoy, which is made clear by the film's audience score. In comparison to the 1st masterpiece this one was really not that good."
7.0,20 October 2024,"All this build up after a masterful first movie.... Just to ruin it all by saying that Fleck isn't the Joker that eventually will become Batman's arch nemesis in the future. What a complete and total waste. This sequel completely ruined everything that was built up in the first Joker movie.

A musical?? WHY????? I'm starting the think that a musical was the only way they could fill up enough screen time to make a full length motion picture. Because clearly, this story and the plot were not enough. And in the process they totally ruined the Harley Quinn character as well. We all know that Harley was THE Joker's girlfriend. Not the girlfriend of some guy who inspired the actual Joker.

I am so utterly disappointed in this sequel that the only way I can summarize it, is with this: The makers of this sequel took all that was great about the first film, put it all in a bag, then took a huge steaming dump inside that bag. Then they laughed all the way to the bank."
1.0,6 October 2024,"After reading several bad reviews about this movie, I was a bit scared that I would be very disappointed. Luckily, I entered the cinema with an open mind and tried not to be affected by what most people were saying.

The truth is, I was a huge fan of the first Joker movie and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker was, and is, brilliant. Even on this second movie. That didn't disappoint. What I think is not everyone's cup of tea is the fact that there's a lot of singing going on and at times, I felt like it was dragged and forced only because we had Gaga in it. She's a great singer and a good actress but in my opinion, I suppose that all the singing is there because she's in it. It wouldn't be bad, if there weren't so many scenes with songs that cut the serious and darker moments of the movie short. ( And yes, I do like musicals!). However, I believe that, like me, most people enjoyed precisely that darker aspect and armosphere of the first movie in the first place.

Also, although I understand that there needed to be an end to close the Todd Philips' Joker chapter, I didn't quite like this particular ending.

All in all, I think it's a creative and brave attempt of the director but It was also a shot in the dark. It's one of those movies that you either hate or you are confused about whether you really liked it or not. Joaquin's astonishing performance will hopefully help you see that, in the end, it was a good movie. Not brilliant like the first one, but still a good one."

6.0,4 October 2024,"Maybe it's my bad luck that I saw this movie's rating before going to the cinema with my sister. I love the experience of watching a creation like this on a Dolby big screen but I was so confused the whole time as when will stuff start blowing up and the action begin?

This movie does not really satisfy the expectations that was built from the first one. It is not crazy, it's not madness, it's just odd drama. Half the scenes are a creation of Arthur Fleck's (The Joker) imagination and my sister actually argues that the whole things was a dream!

One thing I like about this movie is Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, and the singing really added a new exciting element to the movie (Sinatra fan here). It's a pity the story just wasn't there to support it. It's worth a watch anyway just don't expect a lot."

Dark atmospheres, green lights to represent sadness like in the first one.

From a psychological point of view, really VERY interesting.

Beautiful Jazz music, honestly for a musical it didn't even have too many songs, and Lady Gaga was obviously very good at singing (her character is a bit hateful but that's okay) The real problem of the film is the little change of settings and the total lack of action, but it is justified by the fact that it is not just any Joker film, this will delve into the depths of Joker's mind.

Honestly , for me Phoenxi should win an oscar for his INCREDIBLE performance as always, but sadly I already know that it won't win."
7.0,4 October 2024,"The only good aspect of this film was the cinematography of Lawrence Sher, for the other parts...better to not talk about. Throughout the entire film you are left with the feeling of wanting something to happen, but yet again, nothing happens. The first act lasts at least a minimum of 1 hour, pretty boring, hard to watch and doesn't set up much for the rest of the film. The character developement of Li (Lady Gaga) is not built right and we never get to see or feel the characters motivations for their actions, (assuming that they make actions) , cause is fact nobody does a well constructed action in this film. To cut it short: Dull writing. Bad script. Bad direction. Bad editing. And the sound mix, such a mess!"
1.0,5 October 2024,
9.0,3 October 2024,"Complete trash. Better avoid this movie. If you watch this then The Image of Joker from First movie will get Ruined. There is literally nothing in this movie.

They should have progressed story to the level where Joker becomes main villian in Gotham City like we know. Would have been GREAT.

Whole movie is Boring. Making it like a musical movie is even worse decision. Do they really watch their own movie? Probably they just wanted to get money from this. There was no effort to make anything likable. Even ending is so bad as nothing happens. Just good things are cinematography & that main music which are copied from first movie and flashback scenes from first movie.

Avoid this watching in theater. You will get disappointed."
7.0,3 October 2024,
1.0,5 October 2024,"I'm still trying to process how disappointed I am with this latest installment. It's a crushing letdown, and honestly, it's even more underwhelming than Coppola's Megalopolis this year. I was hyped for this film, but it failed to deliver on nearly every level. Warner Bros. Needs to take a hard look at their creative control over their hit movies, because this sequel is a straight-up embarrassment. It's like they took everything that made the original great and threw it out the window.

I'm genuinely sad to see a beloved character and story fall so far from its former glory. This franchise deserved better, and the fans deserved more. The plot was a mess, the characters were paper-thin, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I'm still wondering how a film with so much potential could go so wrong. I hope the studio takes this as a wake-up call and goes back to the drawing board to figure out what made the original film so great in the first place.

Right now, I'm just left feeling disappointed and frustrated. This sequel was a waste of potential, and it's a reminder that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone rather than trying to revive something that's best left in the past."
1.0,10 October 2024,"Originally having no interest in the film, but getting curious due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I decided to watch Folie à Deux today to see what went so wrong. But ultimately, I don't think it's nearly as bad as people are making it out to be and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it. However, it most definitely has multiple flaws

Now, this movie is ultimately a courthouse drama, with basically only 2 locations during it's entire runtime. However, I personally found the story interesting and engaging enough to keep watching and not get bored. There are a few very questionable moments in the script though.

The movie itself looks gorgeous. The cinematography and the directing was amazing and there isn't a single even remotely bad looking shot in this film. The acting from Phoenix is as outstanding as expected and Gaga also did quite well in my opinion.

But where the movie fails, is that it's more of an epilogue than a sequel. There's not much new it puts on the table. Even Harley Queen seemed like an unnecessary addition that ultimately didn't matter. The whole movie is basically just talking about the events of the last one. There are some moments where it tries to show the consequences of the last film's actions (and I did like what they did do with that), but this aspect also seemed to be overshadowed by just recapping things that we already did see happen previously.

The musical aspect of the movie is definitely something people are torn about, but I find myself in the middle of the pack. Sometimes the singing worked quite well in the context and the movie did have some fantasticly directed musical segments. But other times, this aspect felt too forced and just took you out of the mood. I also think they could've been built into the movie better. Instead of them being just day dreaming sequences, they should've tied them into regular scenes, like a normal musical would.

People really seem to hate the ending, and I honestly don't get why. I thought it was (for the most part) a quite powerful, fitting and tragic end to the character. But it wasn't anything revolutionary or anything that would keep me thinking for more than an hour after the movie.

In conclusion, there is a lot of flaws with this film and it could've been so much better. But I do feel like it's very overhated and I found myself engaged and interested in what was happening in the film. Despite the cons, I still liked the movie, but it is quite forgetable."
7.0,2 October 2024,"I loved the first part. It was one of the best movies in the past 10 years. But this one, this is a complete pile of s***.

Story doesn't even exist, it is a damn musical for no good reason. Actually, it all looked like a big advertisment for Lady Gaga.

The only thing that would maybe justify better rating is Joaquin's acting which is the only superb thing in this movie.

Such a disappointment, I had such a high hopes for this one. But they ruined it, just like so many other movies in the past years that were supposed to be good.

I hope this gets rated as low as possible so that the writers in Hollywood wake up and stop writing these types of scripts.

Disappointed."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Truth be told, this film should not work and yet Joker: Folie à Deux is daring, ambitious and ungainly in crazy ways. Phillips' bold choices don't all pay off, but they beat the fan-serving rehash that could have been. This quasi-musical courtroom drama is as deliberately obtuse and anti-crowd-pleasing as it possibly can be. Turning the whole Joker and Harley dynamic on its head and inversing their usual roles, Harley manipulates Arthur into the man she wants instead. It's a bizarre stroke of genius that works wonders when coupled with Pheonix and Gaga's performances. Uncertainty is the best element of the film, which sees the performances kicking off at angles when you least expect them to. The two take centre stage and deliver shining interpretations of these timeless characters, Gaga especially, such an inspired choice for Harley. Fantastic production design working in conjunction with the photography gives Director Todd Phillips a major helping hand, the musical moments do tend to come out of nowhere and stick out but I ultimately ended up liking the majority of them, the Hildur Guðnadóttir really did a number on this score. Laudable as the intentions of Folie à Deux may be, it feels thoughtfully but tiresomely stuck in the past. Still better than The People's Joker though..."
6.0,1 October 2024,"Absolutely misses the feel of the original.

The fact something is made doesn't mean it was necessary.

Style over substance

The first one had a compelling story and details the sympathetic tellings of Arthur Flick. This movie is just wasting film and audiences.

Lady Gaga is underused and misused. Unfortunately, it was pointless to bring up the Harley-type character.

The movie does not have the same atmosphere or storytelling. It seemed forced and not really embracing the character.

The original used violence as means of the story. While here comedic and pointless.

This movie does not add to the tale of Flick but just a useless money-grab that will besmirch the original more than it helps."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Perhaps people are becoming disconnected from art. I want to express my gratitude to Todd Phillips for delving deep into the mind of the Joker and truly exploring it. Joaquin Phoenix deserves to win an Oscar every time he plays the Joker. Lady Gaga was perfect. A perfect fit. Harley Quin with the heartbreaker. Harley was in love with the Joker. Author turned his back on him. Harley is about that life. And she wont stop. The film was brilliant, the music was beautiful, and the ending was perfect. I would rate it 8.5/10. Anyone saying it was trash isn't a fan of art and art is dying.

9.0,2 October 2024,"The new ""Joker"" movie completely misses the mark, stripping away the dark allure and captivating intensity of the first film. Turning it into a musical feels like a baffling decision that ruins the atmosphere. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't add anything new to the role, and Lady Gaga's performance lacks the excitement you'd expect. The musical numbers feel out of place, with poorly chosen songs that fail to resonate. Overall, it's a disjointed and uninspired sequel that doesn't live up to the original. Skip this one and hold onto the original ""Joker"" - that's the version worth keeping in mind.

DC wake up with you next movie!"
1.0,7 October 2024,"I was really looking forward to this movie, as I really enjoyed the first one, but this one was a complete disappointment. Honestly, it wasn't a problem the fact that it was musical - take out the music and the movie is still bad. There is no character development, the story is flat, the fact that they added the character Lee (Lady Gaga) makes no difference to the story whatsoever. I read that some people are saying that, just like in the movie, the audiences cared about the Joker and not Arthur Fleck, but in all fairness it's a movie about the Joker, so it's what I expect to see.

All in all, this movie will leave you disappointed."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Actually it is not ... when it comes to funny ... I mean there were chuckles and if you have a twisted sense of humor, you will be able to laugh at times ... so I reckon no pun intended? Just be aware that this is not your typical superhero movie (or comic book, since there is no super hero in that sense, but rather villains - we get a new one before he went rogue here). It also is not your typical musical ... if you can even call it that.

On the other hand, is it a drama? Court room and otherwise? I expected this to break free - in more than one sense, so I reckon this is another pun(?) ... but it did stay within the confinement it set out for itself.

So I fully understand why many were not impressed ... to say the least ... that said, if you like movies to be weird ... seemingly without a story .. but crazy characters ... well this could be for you. This tries hard to be outside the norm ... but also might destroy whatever you may have thought of the very first one. I assume you have seen it - so I will go on: we were not sure if whatever we saw, actually happened (as in being ""real"" in the movie world we dived in) ... seems that most actually happened ... so the joke is on us? Well not entirely, but every thought we had, is either destroyed or validated ... good or bad ... you decide.

This tried the shock value ending too ... does it succeed? I was wondering who that character was supposed to be ... a replacement or another character? Seems more like the former even though we can't entirely see what he is doing in the background, while our focus in on the foreground ... for obvious reasons I will not reveal ... is this ending satisfying though? Hardly for most ... but it is what it is ... and while the singing and dancing did not bother me (it's clear Phoenix will not win a grammy anytime soon) ... the songs are quite famous too .... well I am not sure how they will play out for most people.

The director already stated he does not want to make another one - he might have preemptively take a decision that would have been made for him ... although if I was him, I probably would be like: you don't want another one? Well boo hoo, I will make another one ... but maybe best to ... rest his case! (yes I went there)"

The musical parts were overdone (it was creative, but they could've cut out a couple musical parts), and some of the plot felt unnecessary. Honestly, if they never made this film, I wouldn't even be mad. However, the acting was great, the tone was dark, and there was some great symbolism. Lots of potential, but it didn't quite hit the mark. This felt like more like a romantic musical then a thriller. I did enjoy the continuation of Arthur Flecks story and it had it's standout moments. I just think the hype was too much from the first film and the musical (even though creative) might not have been the best way to portray the film."

This movie isn't a musical at all. And yes, it has a story-a complex one, far from typical popcorn cinema. It takes you on a journey into Arthur Fleck's reality, constantly blurring the line between his world and the real world around him.

The musical sequences highlight the strange complexity of the two main characters, dragging each other down in a spiral of psychosis.

And the ending? Pure genius!

The score is perfect, the use of color and camera work is fantastic! Not to mention the stellar performances by Phoenix and Lady Gaga-absolutely fabulous. The movie pulled me in and didn't let go until the curtains closed."
9.0,3 October 2024,"What in the world has just happened? They took the brilliance of the first Joker-a masterpiece of dark, psychological storytelling-and drowned it in unnecessary, over-the-top singing! As if the gritty, tortured psyche of Joker needed a soundtrack to go along with his chaos. Every time a song started, it felt like the movie forgot what it was supposed to be, transforming from a tense psychological thriller into some bizarre Broadway musical experiment.

Joaquin Phoenix, as always, was a gem. He brought something unique and transformative to the character the first time, which is why his portrayal was so widely praised. Unfortunately this time even his brilliance couldn't shine through, leaving the film weighed down despite his best efforts.."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I can't even find the right words to describe how disappointing this was to watch. Trash trash trash. Terrible versions of joker and Harley, horrid acting, so much damn singing and such a vague/boring story. My honest reaction and opinion is WTF. Bury this movie and don't let people see such garbage. I love lady Gaga, and I love joker/harley which made this even more irritating. Not even worthy of being associated with such epic characters. I don't even know the name of the dude that played joker here but he was terrible and an insult to his character. Same with Harley, doesn't matter that she was played by lady Gaga, this was the worst version I've ever seen."
1.0,4 October 2024,
6.0,4 October 2024,"Honestly, first things first! Yes, the movie does not even come close to the first part.

My main critic is that it doesn't add any value to the overall Joker Story!

There's nothing to gain by watching this movie!

The first movie, which was close to perfection the way it was, already told everything that needed to be told!

So this part only capitalizes off of the first film and the events that happened and tries to tie a story around it and reoccurring characters.

The musical part didn't bother me as much as I expected it would, because i don't like musicals at all!

But it was something i could stick through, although I feel like they did overdo it at times and the movie could've been a bit shorter, if they had decided to cut some of the music shorter.

It would've helped the movie. It's a bit overlong, which honestly did bore me a bit.

Overall the movies not really great but it's not as bad as they make it out to be. I've seen much worse movies this past decade. Sure it's not up to par with part 1 and it totally leaves a stain on the amazing first movie, but it still was fun to jump in that little world that Todd Phillips has built. I think a lot of the negative reviews are honestly just fans that are disappointed that this one didn't live up to the hype.

It's somewhere between 6 and 6.5 in my book."

6.0,4 October 2024,"This can't be the sequel to one of the greatest films of recent times. I still remember the goosebumps I had once I was done with the 2K19 version, not to mention the standing ovation crowd gave to Joaquin's performance that completely shattered everyone's impression that Heath Leager's joker depiction cannot be equalled.

Just like Dark Knight trilogy I expected the creator to take this franchise a knot above but they completely failed everyone's expectations. Even Joaquin's performance and epic background score weren't enough to save this sequel. Lady Gaga is underutilised and is there in the movie just for the songs. Folie à Deux completely diminishes the legacy of Joker. Why make a musical to an epic and ruin the anticipation of fans???

Although I would say it's a visual masterpiece, with many scenes that will make long lasting impression especially the one where Phoenix is escorted by prison guards and it starts raining and all guards open their umbrellas which are of different colors and Phoenix is standing in the middle drenching in the rain. These scenes will make you think how great this movie could have been.

A huge disappointment for sure!!!"

7.0,9 October 2024,"As I'm obviously in the minority, I very much enjoyed this film. The musical part was well done, and the lyrics were important. The movie as a whole was incredibly nuanced, as we dove further into the psyche of Arthur Fleck. It lulled slightly in spots, but kept me intrigued throughout. Now after the movie I'm still thinking about it and developing my own theories. The acting was excellent, even if the dialogue wasn't top tier, they made it work. Definitely recommend, but don't go in expecting something it's not. It's a movie that will make you think, not just have gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence. Watch it with an open mind and pay attention, or it will definitely seem boring (which is why I understand that is has the rating that it does on here)."
1.0,2 October 2024,"If you watched the first 20 minutes of the movie, left for an hour, and then returned asking what you missed, your friend would likely say, ""Nothing."" I'm not particularly fond of the first part, but at least it had something worth watching or a story to tell.

However, this work is a disaster no one could have imagined. Literally nothing happens, and even the songs and performances feel incredibly dull and out of place. The acting might be relatively good, but without a script, without events, and without a true film.

The shock lies in how the filmmakers convinced themselves that what they were making was a movie. The entire hall was filled with boredom, despite it being a special screening of the film. Everyone felt bored, and half the audience even fell asleep. And when we finally reached the climax and everyone was expecting something to happen... nothing did. If you asked someone to come up with the worst possible ending for this film, it still wouldn't compare to the sheer absurdity of the actual ending.

This film might become one of the worst in the last five years, not just because of its poor quality, but because of the downfall from a record-breaking film that was agreed upon by both critics and audiences, to a repulsive movie that's hard to finish watching."
10.0,4 October 2024,"Crowdthink will tell you different. But crowdthink gets its kicks from tiktok and being spoon-fed lightweight cultural candyfloss.

This movie is the bravest and most experimental mainstream release you'll catch in some time. Todd Phillips, take a bow.

A musical that's not a musical and a courtroom drama that's not a courtroom drama, hooked on some bemusing, dazzling hybrid of the two, utilising raw, rough musical numbers to as a mechanism to convey depth, motivation and explore character relationships.

Phoenix blows the mind with his range and command of minutae, Gaga et al are wonderful in support; what a voice that *disturbingly* hot psychotic chick has...

This is not what you expect but damn sure you need from a mainstream release that dares to experiment with genre styles, and delivers some wildly entertaining sequences.

Not to mention contentious nods to the Batman canon, at times shot like a sprawling Nolan landscape, or even a Burton surrealist piece.

No spoilers, but the jaw-dropping ending will have you either spewing nerd outrage or grinning like, well Arthur Fleck, as the bait and switch hits... Hey, we did say it was an origin story, right? And you do know he was the Joker, right?

Nobody said it was THE Joker, riiiight...

Yes, half of a Joker movie is a musical. Second, it seems like something went off the tracks during production. Either the director got mad, Lady Gaga got mad, or the studio got mad. Nothing makes sense. Nothing gets resolved. The script is all over the place. Third, this movie adds nothing to the original Joker. It is as if everyone wanted to see how to absolutely ruin this Joker franchise and did so with flying colors. Fourth, what was the point of this movie? More questions. Zero answers. The story is just confusing, boring, and put people to sleep at my showing. Fifth, the ending pushed this to a 1 for me. I had it at around a 5/10 until the last 10 minutes.

Sweeney Todd was a better musical with blood and intense scenes, SO how could you make this movie so boring...I will admit i loved one of the songs, its the scene where Lady Gaga visits Joker at Phone Call visitation in Prison...I never use the bathroom during films but I used the bathroom and got refills 3 times during this movie...and I went whenever the singing and dancing numbers came up! So if you go see this movie, use the bathroom everytime they start singing...It was awful but it had too much singing and dancing, and JOKER 2019 was a complete different experience...6/10...next time, don't make it a Disney Musical..."

We wanted action and a better continuance from the first sad story, but instead got a musical with fantasy scenes every 3 minutes which was the only place any escape was found from the boring dialog. I cannot overstated how disappointing this movie was. I've loved Jauquin Pheonix, but don't waste your money. We waited FOR-EV-ER for this movie to come out, hoping to see an evolution of the joker and maybe the emergence of batman, but it didn't come close. Truthfully, I would've picked Margo Robbie over lady gaga and kept it to what the narrative has been originally. My interests lie with unsuspecting move goers and this is not an exaggerated review. You'll be sad if you go."
1.0,11 October 2024,"The film continues the line of exploring Arthur's mental illness and incarceration rather than the emergence of the Joker as some arch-villain. Also a lot on how fame/fantasy is grabbed by the public ignoring the reality.

As has been said, lots of musical interludes, like a lot of Dennis Potter work for television. I've personally never been a fan of approach, but a good vehicle for showing the blurring between reality and fantasy.

A lot made of the prison hospital and courtroom for the viewer to decide if Arthur has mental illness or not alongside the jury. Almost a review of The Joker.

Overall, a beautiful looking movie but didn't do it for me. I really wanted more Joker and less Arthur."
6.0,3 October 2024,"Let's cut to the chase: Joker 2 is an unholy mess-a dumpster fire wrapped in a pretentious bow. It's as if the creators decided to throw out everything that made the first film a haunting exploration of mental illness and replace it with a hollow, cliché-laden spectacle that panders to the lowest common denominator.

Remember how Joker held a mirror to the darker corners of society? Well, this sequel is just a funhouse mirror, reflecting distorted caricatures of its characters while simultaneously obliterating their depth. Arthur Fleck's descent into madness was a visceral journey; here, it's just a lazy stroll through a comic book cliché.

And let's talk about Harley Quinn. What happened to the brutal, chaotic love story that rocked the very foundations of their twisted relationship? Instead, we get a half-baked romance that feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine connection. Arthur and Harley's dynamic is now as shallow as a kiddie pool, stripped of the raw emotion that made their narrative compelling.

The climax? A nonsensical mess, featuring a random character who exists solely to meet a bloody end-because apparently, shocking violence is the last refuge of a lazy script. There's no coherent story arc, just a series of aimless scenes that fail to capture the essence of the original. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board of plot devices and hoped for the best.

The musical numbers? An auditory assault that adds nothing but further emptiness to an already vacuous experience. It's almost impressive how they managed to achieve zero emotional resonance in a film filled with song and dance.

In conclusion, Joker 2 is a painful watch, a cautionary tale of what happens when studios prioritize spectacle over substance. Here's hoping the creators take a long, hard look at their choices-or, better yet, just step away from the industry entirely."
2.0,8 October 2024,"Giving this an 7/10 rating

This film is 'One flew over the Cuckoos Nest' in it's inspiration, just like 'Joker' was 'King of Comedy'. I can see why the reviews have been not good for this film, Seems like a lot of disappointment going around for this, but my view is this, it's still an good film, but it has lost it's edge compared to the first one, and with Lady Gaga and the music and the locations, it is a very different film, which it had to be.

Everything is good, Gaga is really remarkable and you she really does shine and without her, this would of been a below par film, as the plot is a bit weak, not as sharp as the last film, but the work on screen is very good, and I can see why Joaquin came back to do it, it's not the first film, not a rehash.

The music brings fun and some visual splendour and trickery are littered throughout the film, and the violence is there, not as much as before. A damaged film, but not as bad as the reviews make it out to be."
7.0,4 October 2024,"Are you kidding me with this movie? It doesn't continue anything. It doesn't bring anything new to the table outside of nonsensical musical numbers that don't advance the plot.

Face it, this is just an opportunity for the director to stop making Joker movies after most likely being told that there would be a sequel. What's the best way to Frankenstein your situation? Just make a horrible movie.

In essence, Phillips has made The Hangover II - Part 2. Just the same tropes with 50 shots of actors smoking cigarettes and singing standard songs of the 30s and 40s.

Save yourself the chance to walk out on the movie. Just don't buy a ticket."
1.0,6 October 2024,
6.0,6 October 2024,"This movie will be a disappointment if you go into it expecting something specific. If anything, this movie is failing because it continues the spirit of the first movie which was to be an anti comic book movie. I think a lot of people were expecting it to course correct and become something standard. I agree it wasn't as good as the first one but they did a great job of creating something unconventional which I appreciate in the current cinema environment that just retells the same stories. Much of the emotional experiences in this film are the same as the first. Mind mind is already racing trying to figure out what I just saw which is a good sign."
1.0,3 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was a huge disappointment. The film was incredibly boring, with far too much focus on musical numbers that didn't fit at all. The constant singing made it unbearable, and there was hardly any action to keep the pace up. It dragged on for what felt like an eternity. As a sequel to the brilliant first ""Joker"" film with Joaquin Phoenix, this one didn't live up to any expectations.

The decision to turn this sequel into a musical likely came from Todd Phillips, who directed both films, along with the creative team. It's surprising considering how well-received the original ""Joker"" was. It feels like a missed opportunity, especially after setting the bar so high with the first movie. Overall, it was a terrible experience, and I have no desire to ever watch it again. Definitely a waste of potential and not worth the time."
1.0,12 October 2024,"If you want to waste your money and three hours of your time then this movie for you! It was so bad, bad enough where the whole movie theatre row I was in was on their phones. If I could have given this negative stars, I would have because one star is giving it too much.

Since I need six hundred characters for this post, and I've already given you the basic point of how dumb and pathetic this movie actually is, I'm going to say how bad of an actress Lady Gaga is. Like I get it she is a singer, made this movie into basically a musical, that if I never have to hear another Lady Gaga song for the rest of my life, I'd be happy. Since I met the minimum character limit I'll stop typing now. If you're reading this to here, congratulations, you made it!"
7.0,10 October 2024,"I'm not trolling here, I genuinely thought this was a fantastic movie.

I read reviews before seeing this movie for myself and it honestly lowered my expectations a lot. However, I felt like Todd Phillips did a wonderful job crafting a true comic book movie here. The musical number cutaways not only made the movie feel more like a comic book but also depicted well the insanity of Joker and Harley Quinn, especially Joker

I may be a little biased here because I enjoy musicals and comic book movies but, I would have thought less of Todd Phillips if he hadn't showcased the talents of Lady Gaga. This is a great movie, see it for yourself and make your own judgment. I'm happy as a clown that I did."
1.0,10 October 2024,"This movie is truly awful. The plot consists of absolutely nothing, there's random singing for no reason every 5 minutes, it's randomly focusing on Lady Gaga for no reason... the only thing holding this together is Joaquin Phoenix's acting and the 7 minutes of normal movie scattered here and there.

It's sad to see something that was so amazing in the first movie, be thrown into the garbage on the sequel. I truly hope the director Todd Phillips reflects on how badly he dropped the ball on this as there were a lot of fans that I sadly think will never come back after that travesty of a sequel..."
7.0,9 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux was a disappointment despite Joaquin Phoenix's strong performance. While his portrayal of Arthur Fleck was captivating, the film faltered in its attempt to blend psychological drama with musical elements. The potential development of his relationship with Harley Quinn, played by Lady Gaga, felt overshadowed by excessive, unnecessary musical numbers I fell asleep to. The songs were well-executed, and I enjoyed Lady Gaga's performance but this blend belonged on Broadway; NOT my local movie theater! Ultimately, the film lost focus, dragging the narrative down and missing its true potential."
1.0,12 October 2024,"I've never walked out of a cinema half way through a film until now..

What a complete let down, there isn't a story line at all, I found it hard to engage in the film as every 15 minutes it flits into a random musical. Completely odd film and a very poor follow on. How can they produce such a great first title to then follow it up with this complete and utter rubbish! We all waited a long time for the second instalment of the joker franchise and this has ended any hope of getting a third title. What were they thinking this would achieve!

Do not waste your time or money with this one complete disappointment!"
7.0,10 October 2024,"In the way that the first Joker movie went up a mountain of delusional power in chaos, this movie comes back down that mountain in a dirty and nasty way, dotted with musical humor (maybe one song too many), and giving a shallow second glance at a shallow and broken human being.

This is where the DC universe should be, when talking about the joker. This seems right. It seems to suddenly turn around and realize there was this trope behind the camera that it now sees, consequence. But it still stokes a little bit of the cult fire, even if it blows much of it out.

I'm happy and proud to have watched it. It went a direction it should've."
1.0,1 October 2024,"Disappointing, disjointed effort that lacks focus and cohesion. Despite Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's involvement, their performances fall flat in a confusing narrative with erratic tonal shifts. The result is a cringeworthy sequel that fails to live up to the original's intensity. The film's attempt to blend psychological drama with romance feels forced and awkward, adding to the overall confusion. Ultimately, what could have been a gripping sequel collapses under its own disorganization. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. Despite the hype, Joker fails to deliver anything memorable, leaving audiences frustrated rather than entertained."
10.0,10 October 2024,Everybody keeps saying this is some awful sequel or something but it's honestly not that bad. It's very much different than the original in the sense it's kind of a full on musical but not fully it's confusing but I think people just expected it to be like the first one but it's not so I feel people are just mad because of that. I would agree the first film is stronger it has a overall stronger direction I would say but at the same time I still enjoyed this film more than a lot of other people seem to. Joaquin Phoenix is really great as expected he was really great in the original joker film and lady Gaga did a pretty great job as Harley Quine she still isent as great as Margot Robbie's Harley Quine but she was really good and fit the film. This film definitely Doesn't have nearly as strong of a direction as the first one it kind of just keeps going and then stops and then goes again but it's still not bad I don't think this is that bad of a sequel. So yeah I enjoyed the movie for what it was I didn't think it was that bad.
6.0,4 October 2024,"The first Joker is in my top 10 movies of all time. But this movie was a complete disappointment. Surprisingly the musical elements worked. They really did. Ignore all the review bombs about it being a musical. Because that is not the problem here. They were one of the best parts of the movie. It was enjoyable up until around the last 20 minutes. Had me thinking I was going to love this one too. But then they take the most drastic character change possible and completely destroy the character. It's like the director set out to piss in the mouth of the fans of the first movie and fans of the Joker character. There's no other way this could have been thought of. It really seems like they set out to ruin it for the fans. If you are not a fan of the first you will probably like this. This movie completely ruins everything the first did. So please, if you are a fan of the first don't ruin it for yourself by watching this :("
1.0,2 October 2024,"I saw the first film three times and felt it did an excellent job of returning to the early 2000s DC style instead of trying to emulate Marvel, which set my expectations high for this sequel.

So, where do I begin with this movie? It attempts to engage viewers but ultimately wastes time on pointless side stories that go nowhere, and instead of a fulfilling experience, it layers nostalgia in a desperate bid to justify the wasted time.

Transforming the entire story into a musical in an effort to extend the film was, quite frankly, one of the worse choices made in production; I genuinely don't understand the decision to take this direction, as the songs feel out of place within the narrative. While I've been quite critical so far, I've tried to keep this review spoiler-free for those still interested in watching. If there is any silver lining, it would be the film's potential, although I remain puzzled by the random appearance of rainbow flags in certain scenes."
1.0,3 October 2024,"The sociopathy of Lee and the fans who cheer for Joker outside the court, even if he is a murderer, is well represented in those who criticize this film because they wanted and expected Joker but couldn't care less about Arthur. I believe it is a glimpse into a cross-section of society that is very well done and, from what I am seeing, successful in its purpose. I didn't love the musical, even more so the ending. The theme of the double, starting from the name, is the principle of the whole film. Two hours that pass very quickly and pleasantly, a film that is little connected to the previous one."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I'm really disappointed with this new direction for the 2024 Joker film. The original 'Joker' was a raw, dark exploration of mental illness and society's failings, with a tone that was unsettling and deeply impactful. It didn't rely on cheap tricks to make a point; it was grounded and gritty, which made Arthur Fleck's descent into madness feel real and haunting.

So why turn the sequel into a musical? This feels like a complete disconnect from what made the first movie so powerful. Instead of continuing with the same intense atmosphere, we're bombarded with music at every turn, even in moments that should have been suspenseful or emotionally heavy. It almost feels like the filmmakers were more interested in crafting a musical experience than telling a compelling story.

The constant musical interruptions destroy the tone of Gotham's chaotic underworld. It's frustrating because it feels like a decision to stand out rather than honor what made the original so memorable. A flashy musical? That's not what Joker fans signed up for. We wanted to see Arthur Fleck's journey continue, not break into song. If you don't have Spotify Premium, you can watch this movie."
1.0,6 October 2024,"I really wanted to like this. Its not a film you can enjoy much of, the almost continual misery suffocates the plot development. Joker is not who his followers want him to be, in much the same was this film continually refused to be what we wanted it to be. Maybe that was the point, but its still too flat a story about mental heath and the institutions that have blurred line surrounding care vs incarceration. There are some great moments and great performances, but it could have have been so much more without, a few less songs and more complex and contrasting story arcs would have opened it up a little. Shame."
7.0,8 October 2024,
1.0,3 October 2024,If you liked the first one do not see this atrocity. It's a total character deconstruction . I knew it was not gonna be that good but i went and see it nonetheless and i hate myself for it please do yourself a favor and don't go. We see the same old pathetic Arthur Fleck just like in the first one there is no progression . There are some glimpse of the joker but too short and mostly in Arthurs head i think they needed them to use in the trailer so they could bait u in it . I liked gaga as harley but it does nothing for the movie . The ending let's just say please get up and go before the ending it is not worth seeing it doesn't get better at any point .
7.0,7 October 2024,"This is a good movie. As good as the first one? No, not even close, but still a good movie. Too many songs? Yes, for sure, the ""musical"" side of the movie is completely unnecessary, but this is not a terrible movie by any stretch of imagination. All the hate, all the incredibly low rates make me doubt the iq of the people that watched it. The hype was over the roof, the expectations too high, the story of the first movie didn't need a sequel at all, still we got a good movie, what's so wrong about it? Nothing, people love to hate these days for no real reason, so it's rather incredible masterpiece or utter garbage, there's no space between anymore... But in this case we got overall solid acting (incredible by Phoenix as usual), believable development of the story and a relevant ending, so the sequel that nobody really needed is still an extremely enjoyable movie, live with it."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Far beyond disappointing. The first Joker was a cinematic masterpiece-gritty, intense, and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, the sequel is the complete opposite. I left the cinema feeling genuinely confused and let down, wondering how a follow-up to such a phenomenal movie could end up this bad. It felt like a cheap attempt to cash in on the original's success without understanding what made it so great in the first place.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance was, once again, nothing short of amazing. He brought the same intensity and raw emotion that made his portrayal of Arthur Fleck so captivating in the first film.

If you loved the first Joker, do yourself a favor and pretend this movie doesn't exist. Let the original stand as a powerful, standalone film that should never have been followed by something so lackluster."
9.0,5 October 2024,"Going into this movie tonight, I thought it was going to be absolutely terrible having read the reviews. I was a massive fan of the first movie so I expected it to be dramatically worse based on the critic reviews. Now, after watching myself, I'm convinced that the people saying this is bad simply didn't have the IQ to understand it at all! It looks like everyone has jumped on a bandwagon saying it's bad cause they have the attention span of a goldfish and can't watch a couple of 1 minute scenes of music in an over 2 hours long movie. And on the music scenes, they fitted well with the story and encapsulated the delusions of Arthur (or the Joker)."
7.0,9 October 2024,
2.0,8 October 2024,"This was basically a vanity project for Gaga, it's just 2 hours of her randomly singing what feels like the same 4 songs over and over and over and over again.

It's criminal they packaged this as a Joker movie, it has almost nothing to do with the Joker story, it's just Gaga screaming for 120 mins.

There are no redeeming features to be had here, my wife fell asleep in the cinema, many people walked out (after paying £16 a ticket!) And like a fool I kept telling myself it was going to get better at any moment, it didn't, I wish I had just gone to sleep like my wife and made the most of the dim lights and boring singing.

They should issue an apology aswell as a refund.

The Joker franchise is effectively ruined, the brilliance of the first one has been tarnished and I'll never pay to see a Joker movie again."
1.0,5 October 2024,
7.0,4 October 2024,
1.0,3 October 2024,"A major letdown. The forced musical numbers, especially the awkward duet between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, feel out of place and ruin the dark, gritty vibe. Gaga fails to capture any real chemistry with Phoenix, making their relationship dull and lifeless. The story drags on, offering little depth or tension, leaving the audience bored by an anticlimactic plot. This messy sequel is a far cry from the original's emotional impact, lacking both intensity and purpose. Even the final act, filled with unnecessary chaos, feels forced and lacks emotional payoff. See at your own risk and bring a pillow."
7.0,6 October 2024,"So I went in with low expectations as a lot of the reviews have not been great and some people are saying 'worst movie of the year'. I'm being totally honest don't listen to them. The film is not perfect but I throughly enjoyed it and kept me interested throughout. It's different from the first one and is mainly based around the Joker's court trial and time in prison. This movie is definitely darker than the first. The singing doesn't take away from the movie at all and some songs lighten up the mood. I also liked how they tried to do something different for a DC movie. Some people won't like this as it's different from your average superhero movie and deals with serious issues but it's more original.

Definitely a solid 7 out of 10 for me. If you liked the first go see this one!"
1.0,3 October 2024,"To keep it short, no one should wonder why the DC Universe goes under when movies like this are made. It's just bad has nothing to do with Joker, you could have taken the whole DC thing out and it wouldn't have changed anything. The storyline just doesn't make sense. Why a musical? Why such a script? I really don't know what Tod Phillips is doing with this movie.

I wouldn't recommend it to any DC fan. The singing scenes were so often so out of place and it felt like there was more singing than actual dialog, don't even get me started with the dialog.

The 2nd part has nothing but really nothing to do with the 1st part, the sequences are shown in between, but nothing is done properly. This is a middle finger to all Joker/DC fans. Just sad.

Harley Quinn is in the movie a catastrophe, Lady Gaga did a great job acting, but the character in the movie Harley Quinn was written so cheaply that it's really a lack of competence."
7.0,7 October 2024,"What starts out as a compelling and suspenseful psychological thriller loses itself in an unexpected transformation into a musical drama. The transition feels abrupt and misplaced, leaving the audience wondering what the film really wants to be.

Yet the performances are phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix once again brilliantly takes on the role of Arthur Fleck, a man who doesn't so much embrace crime anymore in the chaos of his own psychological confusion. Lady Gaga, with her raw emotion and powerful presence, is a worthy addition, and together they lift the story to impressive heights. But even their phenomenal performances can't completely save the changing pace and abrupt genre switch.

Perhaps the disappointment for many viewers lies in what Arthur Fleck turns out to be. He is not the genius criminal mastermind we have come to expect from traditional antiheroes. Instead, he is portrayed as a man who is scarred to the core by trauma. Arthur is sick, deeply wounded, and his extraordinary ailments seem like nothing more than a failed attempt to cover up his unbearable pain. There is no plan, no strategy - just chaos and self-destruction.

The film leaves you with a sense of oppressive unease, but perhaps that is precisely the point. ""Joker 2"" forces you to witness the pain of a man who is not a master of his fate, but a victim of his own mind. What the film seems to lack, however, is the balance between that inner despair and the societal responses to it, as its predecessor did so powerfully.

""Joker 2"" is a bold attempt, a film that is brilliant in moments but ultimately loses itself in its own experiments."
1.0,4 October 2024,"The original Joker was a tour de force, a seriously brilliant acting performance by Joaquin Phoenix. The well written story developed with complex undertones, had a great supporting cast and was beautifully shot.

The sequel followed a master-piece to emerge as a piece-of-s##t. It was so disappointing, boring, nonsensical, went nowhere, developed no characters and was truly a waste of some serious acting talent. Not including Gaga in that, she can't act, and Phoenix can't sing, so why, oh why was this a musical? This Todd Phillips movie was not ""brave"", it was just plain rubbish. I was shaking my head in utter disbelief for at least 2 hours of the 2 h18m run time, waiting in vein for it to get better - but that never happened. Will not watch a new Todd Phillips movie ever again. He has punked every fan of the original movie."
9.0,4 October 2024,"I was impressed by the first Joker. Yet the second one is now my favourite, as it shows a different side of madness. The kind we usually call ""love"".

Many critics towards this movie is referring to ""not enough action"" and ""no clear story"". It made me skeptic from the beginning, and lowered my expectations down to a minimum. In fact, the movie is neither about craziness and as we saw it in a first part, nor about violent crimes committed by Joker and his new partner. It is about the relationship of a couple, which appear unexpected, develop though different stages and conclude to its logical final. It grow in a very unusual setting, far from what we would call ""romantic"". Yet it is authentic and reminds us, that everyone, even absolutely abnormal individuals sense such deep feelings. The passion and inspiration that Harley brings into Joker's life are visualised by their songs and appear as musical scenes. Those are directed brilliantly, with amazing visuals and cinematography.

The scene and the dialog in the end of the movie on the well-known stairs, where Joker was dancing alone in a first film, is a statement about the essence of love, as a story of two characters. And if only one of them no longer lives the vision perceived and admired by another, the fairytale falls apart. This is love as we know it, and this is truly a madness."
7.0,6 October 2024,"I genuinely enjoyed watching this film. Thankfully I didn't read any of the reviews before I went to the cinema today - otherwise I probably wouldn't have chosen to see Joker 2.

But gladly I did watch it and I was entertained for the whole running time. It was gut wrenching, sad and the acting is impeccable. Just amazing. Especially Lady Gaga. How can someone be so talented? It didn't seem as if they just casted her because she's famous. She genuinely is a good actress. I also liked that Lee was her own character. She loves the Joker but she isn't just that (a fact that I sometimes miss in other Harley Quinn interpretations).

Brendan Gleeson is amazing as well and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job again.

This film was a bit weaker than the first one but highly enjoyable to watch.

Closer to reality as well as the other films surrounding the Joker story.

If I knew before that this was some sort of musical I probably would have been put off by that too. But it makes sense and feeds the story. It's also fun and weird, just like Harley Quinn and the Joker.

So: interesting and thrilling new take on a story that have been told a few times. Definitely worth watching!"
2.0,4 October 2024,"It's clear Todd Phillips doesn't care about the audience that saw the last movie. The only reason this sequel exists is for the cynical cash grab and so artsy people get to make artsy movies. Hollywood and the East Coast think the rest of us grew up in private schools and we are all actors and writers. No one that liked The Joker ever asked for a musical. Then you mix that with courtroom drama? Why not sprinkle a little summer stock comedy throughout as well? How about some Shakespeare?

Lady Gaga gets type cast which is too bad because if anyone gave a crap and actually wanted to make a dark movie about these characters she could probably turn a really interesting performance in, but I guess we'll never know. If you grew up in theater class from the time you were 4 years old or went to Harvard and studied theater you're going to love this movie."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Why can't I just rate 0 to this mess... One word. Mess.

I love Gaga and we have seen her acting talent, and Joaquin is you know already top-tier but it was painful to watch them getting ROBBED. It was my boyfriend's birthday and the movie destroyed our day honestly lol. If you're into jazz and want to go to Gaga&Joaquin jazz concert go ahead. You'll also get to see a few scenes but yeah every 5 minutes you'll listen to another song other than watching a movie. I didn't thought it would be this bad but man... THIS ACTUALLY MADE ME APPRECIATE HOW EVEN HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL WAS A MASTERPIECE COMPARING TO THIS LMAO. That's all I wanna say."
7.0,7 October 2024,"This film, whilst not living up to the original, or the hype, is really not as bad as people are making out. It really does not deserve as much hate as it is receiving.

Whilst there was quite a lot of potential within this film with its cast and the plot threads that were teased, it missed the mark and made strange choices which led to a rather disappointing end, which I imagine is what has caused most of the over the top hate.

Most of the musical elements worked for me and did genuinely add a deeper level to the film, although there were some other musical scenes that added nothing and should have been cut entirely.

Either way see the film for yourself and make your own decision."
2.0,2 October 2024,"As a huge fan of the first *Joker*, I went into *Joker 2* with high expectations. The original movie was dark, intense, and told a powerful story about Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. It was gritty and had a raw energy that made it stand out from other comic book adaptations. But sadly, *Joker 2* completely misses the mark, and to be honest, it's a massive letdown.

The biggest problem with *Joker 2* is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The original film was very focused on its message and its tone, but this sequel is all over the place. It lacks any clear direction, and I found myself constantly wondering where the movie was going. Instead of being a tight, gripping story like the first one, it feels scattered and confused.

What makes things worse is the decision to turn *Joker 2* into a musical. When I first heard that this film would include musical numbers, I was worried. It's such a strange choice for a character like the Joker, and unfortunately, my fears were confirmed. The musical element doesn't fit at all with the tone of the movie. Every time the story starts to build up some tension or emotion, it gets interrupted by a random song or dance sequence. These scenes are supposed to add something unique, but instead, they end up making the movie feel silly and unfocused.

It's frustrating because there are moments in *Joker 2* where you can see glimpses of what made the first movie so great. The darker, more dramatic scenes still have potential, but they're constantly undercut by these nonsensical musical numbers. It's like the film can't decide if it wants to be a serious psychological drama or a flashy musical, and as a result, it fails at both. The musical scenes turn what could have been intense moments into awkward, boring parts of the movie.

Joaquin Phoenix, who was brilliant in the first movie, feels wasted here. You can tell he's still giving it his all in certain scenes, trying to bring that same depth and intensity to Arthur Fleck's character, but the film doesn't give him the room to fully explore it. Instead, he's forced into these strange, out-of-place musical sequences that take away from his performance. It's a real shame because we know Phoenix is capable of so much more, but the movie doesn't let him shine the way it did in the original.

Another issue is the pacing. *Joker 2* feels both rushed and dragged out at the same time. There are parts of the movie that feel like they're rushing through important plot points without giving them the time they need to develop, and other parts that drag on forever with no real purpose. The result is a movie that feels uneven and disjointed, and it's hard to stay engaged when the story is so all over the place.

What made the first *Joker* so impactful was its slow, deliberate build-up and its focus on Arthur's character development. You could feel his descent into madness, and it was hard not to get pulled into his world. *Joker 2* lacks that same emotional punch. It's missing the subtlety and the tension that made the original so powerful, and instead, it feels like a chaotic mess.

There are a few redeeming qualities in the film. The cinematography is still visually striking, and there are some moments where the film manages to capture that gritty, realistic atmosphere from the first movie. The supporting cast, including Lady Gaga, delivers solid performances, but even they can't save the movie from its own confusion.

In the end, *Joker 2* just doesn't live up to the first film. It's a disappointing sequel that doesn't seem to understand what made the original so great. The musical element, in particular, feels like a huge mistake, and it turns what could have been an interesting follow-up into a confusing and boring experience. Fans of the first movie will likely walk away feeling let down, wondering how a sequel could go so wrong."
7.0,7 October 2024,"Joker: Folie a Deux continues with the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), after the events of Joker(2019). Wrestling with his dual identity as the Joker, Arthur meets & falls in love with Harley Quinn(Lady Gaga), while serving his sentence at Arkham State Hospital.

Joker: Folie a Deux is a pretty good film. It's definitely not terrible, like most critics & viewers are saying. Director Todd Phillips has given us a movie, that takes many bold swings by playing with multiple genres. However, it doesn't really commit to any single genre & that's the film's downfall. Making the sequel to one of the best character studies of a major comic book villain, a musical, was definitely not the way to go. The songs are not at all memorable & completely unnecessary. Each time either Joker or Harley Quinn break into song, I was just waiting for the song to end. The production design by Mark Friedberg during the elaborate song & dance sequences, are incredible & look even better in IMAX. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as Arthur Fleck. If Phoenix was given the same dark thriller genre that he had to work with in the predecessor, he would have knocked it out of the park. Because it's a musical, Joaquin Phoenix's performance suffers because, he doesn't really have flawless singing skills. Lady Gaga is spectacular as Lee Quinzel. Brendan Gleeson is great as Jackie Sullivan. Catherine Keener is superb as Maryanne Stewart. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Sophie Dumond. Harry Lawtey & Leigh Gill are perfect as Harvey Dent & Gary Puddles, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Joker: Folie a Deux is worth a watch for fans of Joker(2019). However, keep your expectations super low. You will be disappointed but, at least you won't be extremely disappointed."
1.0,6 October 2024,"This is a sequel to another movies so there's a reasonable expectation that this movie should feel as if it were a part of the original but it doesn't and one of the major reasons why is simply the singing. Some of the reviews here try to play this down saying there isn't much but it's literally all the time. Someone probably owed Lady Gaga a favor and told her they would put her in a movie and make the movie a musical and, unfortunately for us, this was the movie that Lady Gaga got cast in and ruined our sequel.

This movie has no story, there are no twists and turns, nothing to make you think. There's no action either. This isn't some deep dive into Arthur's mind either like some people suggest. This isn't some psychological drama or thriller. This movie is a rudderless boat going nowhere.

I stand by this movie being made for Lady Gaga to be in a movie with singing -- that's all this is."
6.0,6 October 2024,"I loved the original Joker movie. One of my favourite films of all time. From the acting to the cinematography to the music, etc...

This movie is not the like the first, though there are flashbacks. I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a downright musical, but yes there's quite a bit of singing in it.

The movie is well done overall. The cinematography, the acting and the music are good. I can see where people may be disappointed in the fact that this movie is not like the original. However hearing about how ""horrible"" and ""disappointing"" this film is before going in to watch the film, I honestly went in expecting a disastrous movie and came out actually have enjoyed the film. To be fair though I like some of the music they sang (thanks Michael Buble).

Overall a decent film. Will I re-watch like I do with the original? Probably not. It's not a masterpiece like the original was. That's a shame, but sequels are notoriously not as good as the original and this film is no different... but let me get this clear: this film is not horrible. Just do not go into the movie expecting the same kind of film as the original and you may actually enjoy it."
1.0,2 October 2024,"Sad to see a great independent picture getting destroyed by a forced commercial sequel.

There's no story. Great visuals - huge props to Larry, Jill and the team at C03 - but there's no story! Everything was all over the place.

The whole thing felt rushed, carelessly cut, and honestly just a convoluted, incongruous and unfinished mess that led to nowhere. Nothing amounted to nothing. Just sad.

And why was it turned into a musical? Because there was no actual plot. Something had to keep the audience engaged? Sigh. A fortune has been made on the legacy of the original masterpiece, but at what cost? The Joker franchise is forever scarred."
8.0,2 October 2024,"This movie has forced me to make an account on IMDb, I just can't hold myself from not giving review.

THIS movie will not be digested by everyone, a very unexpected and sad turn of events, very engrossing with musical bend, this movie has left me in weird space of mind, I just can't take it as to what Arthur has been through, imo Todd has deliver the most unexpected, totally not people expected and that is why it won't be everyone's cup of tea but as I see it, it is brilliant, there were times i was in tears, it was too much.

I'd say commendable try by director in delivery something VERY different, VERY unique, VERY unexpected, given the competition in film industry, i can totally understand the courage and risk he took for this but YES THIS joker is my favourite now.

I wish Arthur didn't had to suffer this much, I wish there was someone for him, very sad."
7.0,4 October 2024,"Joaquin Phoenix returns to the role of Arthur in a very impressive performance that stands up to his original performance, and Lady Gaga is fantastic as well. I will say the movie might surprise fans of the first movie because of some stylistic differences but those that can look beyond all the musical numbers might find a movie very similar to the first in terms of grit, acting performances and the anti-superhero movie character study style. I will say that the movie is good but not great, it is brutal shocking bloody and includes a very new version of Harley Quin that fits very well into the sort of movie that the Joker is. I think this might get more love from critics than fans because Joaquins performance expands to show musical theater chops in a way that we haven't seen from him before. There is a lot that is memorable with this movie. The shocking ending is something and though the movie is very much in the same spirit as it's predecessor it feels like a different kind of film."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I just saw Joker 2 in the cinema, and boy, oh boy, it is, well, terrible. As others have mentioned, it is not because the acting, music, direction, singing, or any other obvious aspect of it is bad. It is all very well executed, and Gaga, Pheonix and everybody else did a good job. Bravo, well done.

So yes, it does not deserve one star.

So what is wrong with it? Well read on to find out.

The first movie, although not perfect, was very good. Why can't the first movie just be left alone then? Does everything very good, need a sequal?

Because this sequal, tries the very best it can to UNDO everything that happened in the first movie. It tries to rectify, all the evil of the world (Gotham) and make everything right again. I will not be going into any more detail than that, because that will spoil both the first movie, and this one.

But we as an audience, don't need anything to be put to rights! We don't need anything that the second movie has to offer: We are in the theater to escape our miserable lives, and to be entertained for two and a half hours. To watch something even more miserable, which this is, is not an escape.

So what makes this movie so miserable you ask? Hold on to your popcorn, because here it comes:

THIS SEQUAL wants us to NOT forget that Joker is fiction, and that to me, seeking an escape from reality, is the biggest insult of all.

I am not stupid. I know Joker is fiction, I don't need to be told this through a movie with the same name.

Should I feel guilty for routing for Joker in the first movie? According to this movie: Yes, I should be very ashamed indeed.

So yes, I am sorry folks. If you can, avoid this movie at all costs! It is an insult to everyone involved with cinema, and everybody who just wants an escape, every once in a while."

6.0,7 October 2024,"This movie is a drama movie and kind of philosophy and has a message and dialectical point, this dialect about who is mad and who is not , is it about ecnomic and behavioural backgrounds or everyone can be mad! Even how we can know that its a real or controversy .

A quote from the movie said "" no one cares about Arthur Fleck they only wants drama "" This quote summarise the message of the movie.

This reviews about how is the movie romantic and without madness and boring,this the point of the movie ""no one cares about arthur"" Finally the script is perfect including recaps and gradation of events.

Musical also is a match and part of the delactic."
1.0,20 October 2024,"In my opinion, film director Todd Phillips has done more damage to the famous Batman villain The Joker than Batman himself has done to Joker in the DC Universe, in this film.

With the fantastic opportunity to create something new and original for us fans of the first film that we all thought was a psychological thriller masterpiece, this new film ended even more tragically.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance in the film as the character Arthur Fleck, seemed completely limited. When he did a rare acting mission to reprise a famous character that he created as it was his own in the first film.

Seemed like he was held back a lot by the production of the film.

Phoenix seemed like a complete shadow of himself in this one.

It seemed like this ended even more of a culture crash, when the world-famous musician Lady GaGa got the honor of playing the famous Joker sidekick Harley Quinn, who has for years been the comic book symbol as a female deadly supervillain.

Lady Gaga seemed completely unnatural as an actress in this film, trying her best in her fabulous song numbers that felt like poorly combined to the atmosphere of the story.

Just the musical elements in this sequel from the first movie, just ruin the mega realism effect from the first movie, which shows the authenticity of how society treats the weak in society."
6.0,8 October 2024,"Movie overall 7/10 Acting 10/10

Ok so I'll admit I wasn't going into this with much hope but I was so wrong I don't understand why it's got such a bad review so far

The first is obviously better however Phoenix as always was just outstanding GaGa was no Margot Robbie but matched him so well Really liked the new way into Harley and joker although not comic or usual cannon but I didn't expect that so didn't bother me

So as a musical I don't call it one as such Yes there a many songs and not all help the plot they aren't all the way through I think there the smooth to the rough as the saying goes."
1.0,19 October 2024,"It's an absolute tragedy that such a rich and compelling character could be wasted in a story so devoid of substance. The narrative is painfully shallow, offering little depth or insight into the protagonist's potential. Instead of capitalizing on the character's complexity, the plot meanders with uninspired dialogue and predictable twists. The pacing is dreadful, making it feel like a chore to get through. How such a unique character ended up in a story so lifeless. It's a really big insult to fans who expected something far more engaging and thoughtful. Simply put, a complete disappointment."
7.0,8 October 2024,"It was an okay movie, but it was not so much a Joker movie (so it could have been about anyone).

We didn't see Joker much - as I think everyone expected and went to the cinema for. He was in song/dance scenes, but that's something else entirely. I don't mind the singing/music, I think a few were out of place, but otherwise okay to give atmosphere.

So the main character was missing - Fleck's development was a psychologically, exciting drive in Joker (2019), and there was also action, but here things almost came to a standstill.

So basically lack of action - and the absence of the main character in Joker-apperance.

The acting was great, but the screenplay nothing like the first movie.

Was this a villain in a superhero movie from Gotham city? Not that much..."

9.0,3 October 2024,"There's not too many things in life that can be fully assured but if there's one thing I can be confident of with about as much assurance as one can have is that Joker: Folie à Deux (aka Joker 2) is going to be disliked and likely hated by a lot of people

A $200 million dollar follow-up to one of the most surprising billion dollar earning films off all-time, Joker 2 is for all intents and purposes the anti-2019 Joker.

A film that shares DNA, musical cues, similar stylings and obviously the return of its Oscar winning star Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips, Joker 2 actively works on being almost an entirely different beast as this musically minded and centred oddity goes all out on being the film many will not be expecting or wanting.

Reported over preceeding months to be an all out musical, Joker 2 is as much a court room drama as anything else as Phillips and Phoenix explore the troubled Arthur Fleck's life in Arkham Asylum following the events of the first film as well as his public trial hearing and new found relationship with Lady Gaga's fellow Arkham resident Lee Quinzel.

Infused with a mix of fantastical and very glum music centric scenes that in equal measure happen and not happen in the real world, Joker 2 is a wild swing from Phillips and his team and there's no doubt a lot of these attempts fail to land but at the same time there's still a lot to like here and it's refreshing to see a sequel do so much to separate itself from its forefather who itself leaped out from expectations to great public fanfare.

Dragging in multiple segments across its over two hour running time (there's absolutely indulgence here on Phillips behalf), Joker 2 is still a hauntingly captured film and one whose aesthetic is one to be praised, combining with Phoenix's and Gaga's performances to create some special moments that culminate in an unexpected and brave finale that is going to be a large reason why many waltz out of this event with a bad taste in their mouths, if they didn't already after the many dialogue and music infused moments that help create an anti-comic book movie.

While unlikely to draw the same plaudits as he did first time around, Phoenix is once more a tour de force here as Fleck who is initially outstaged by a scene stealing Gaga who unfortunately suffers from a second half switch around giving her less too do than one might have hoped but when her and Phoenix get to really shine in the spotlight, Joker 2 sings, providing us with ample delights and showcases of the great film Joker 2 might have been.

A dangerous and risky venture that on early signs has appeared to disappoint and anger many fans of the first Arthur Fleck lead outing, Joker 2 stands out as a flawed but also original attempt to do something a little different and while the core themes and ideas from Joker are all present here once more, no one can accuse this follow-up as taking the safe route.

A reminder then that Hollywood still has attempts at going outside the box, even if this efforts reception and colder than expected box office results may halt anyone else having a similar go for sometime.

Final Say -

Not a film for the die-hard fans or mass audience consumption despite its big budget conception, Joker: Folie à Deux is a wildly different beast to what's come before with its sheer audacity and strong performances enough to cover up a large portion of its failings.

7.0,6 October 2024,"The movie has amazing cinematography, the acting is top notch. There are a few scenes that drag on. Everyone is constantly complaining about this movie in reviews and on social media. It's a deep dive into a crazy man's head that falls in love while his life is at rock bottom. It's a courtroom prison movie with a love story and musical elements to it.

The less he takes his meds the more he images his life as a musical. During one of these musical montages he beats a man to death with a chair. Don't let other folks make your mind up for you, go see the movie. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth a watch? Yes."
3.0,4 October 2024,"The moment I knew lady gaga was going to be in it, I knew it was going to fail miserably ... and it did. This movie is one of the worst movies ever filmed in the entire history of movie making... horrible cast, no story.. Best would have been a free release on youtube and still it would have received dislikes... Lady gaga should stop showing up on movies ... just the cringe of having her in a movie !!! Maybe a career advice here to never consider acting again... she ruined the movie. The decision to have this movie as a musical is a slap on the history of Joker's character and the whole DC universe."
1.0,15 October 2024,Isn't that the popular quote from the first film? Ironic how true it rings? People hated Thor 4 but it was more of the garbage they ate up with Thor 3. People are didn't this film to be an absolute stupid mess. Well you got more of what you raved about so much with the first one. When you don't care about an important piece of work being actually good why are you upset you keep getting more of the same. I'm glad so many people can't stand this film. You get what you deserve. Enjoy the mediocrity of Marvel. Enjoy Gunn and his abysmal attempts at DC characters. Enjoy getting more sludge from all the studios. You've been slurping it up for years. You get what you deserve.
7.0,7 October 2024,"Good acting, the musical portions were also well-performed, even though they dragged on at times. The plot was pretty good, but things completely fell apart in the last minutes.

Acting wasn't the issue. Lady Gaga did a great job as Harley ""Lee"" Quinzel. Joaquin excelled again as Arthur Fleck. I enjoyed many of the musical sequences, but like previously mentioned, sometimes the musical numbers went on a little too long. At times, the singing felt like a lazy way to advance the plot.

However, I couldn't think of a more bland ending than this one. Completely deflating. Boring. Lame. The ending makes me wish they had just let ""Joker"" be a standalone movie."
1.0,15 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" falls far short of the psychological depth and originality that made the first film captivating. Instead of delving deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, the sequel feels like a hollow retread of familiar themes without the emotional nuance. The pacing is sluggish, the narrative disjointed, and the attempts at social commentary feel forced and superficial. What once felt like a dark, gritty exploration of society's underbelly now seems like an overdrawn attempt to capitalize on the original's success. The film lacks the intensity that made the first movie memorable, leaving much to be desired. THAT STAR IS FOR THE CINEMATOGRAPHY."
7.0,10 October 2024,"To start with the positives. The acting was superb again. Joaquin Phoenix is a master at his craft and did just as well nailing his role as he did in the first film. Lady Gaga was a surprise for me cause I thought that she was excellent. The ending completely blew me away as I never saw that coming and I actually thought it was a hell of a twist which left me stuck in my seat for a few minutes as the credits started rolling. The negatives, the script sometimes felt a bit messy, and there were some scenes in the film that came off as completely unecessary. Me personally, I not only didn't mind the singing but I believe it did nothing to hurt the film. All in all, it was an enjoyable watch but given its predecessors success as a masterpiece with Oscar awards, it's no question why people are bashing on this film. It went in a different direction and I'm sure the director knew it would have a divisive response from audiences."
1.0,12 October 2024,"The writer apparently had his own personal agenda and cares nothing about the Joker character, just made up something unrelated as it turns out he much rather wanted to do a depressing musical art show. You can tell even from the title, because if you put some french in it, it is super artistic or whatever.

The first one geared up to be a fantastic origins story, then now falls flat, turning into some kind of never ending boring court trial movie with musical flashes, like some weird Bollywood movie, just remove all the action and fun.

It should be illegal to take such a well established character and just turn it into something totally different. It is like taking a Batman origins story and have Bruce Wayne turn into a sad, weak drug addict before he just loses his mind and jumps off a roof wearing a stupid looking halloween costume or something. Please dont ever let these guys near any other well established characters ever again, I would rather watch the original black and white Batman TV series, much better way to spend my time. At least those are so bad they are funny, this one is so bad it is frustrating to watch.

Totally waste of an amazing potential, even the superb acting of Joaquin Phoenix is not even coming close to saving this pretentious boring let down of a movie.

Can we just burn this one, forget it ever happened and make a new one, please."
7.0,2 October 2024,
1.0,10 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux promised to be a daring, artistic exploration of the Joker and Harley Quinn's twisted dynamic. Instead, it serves up a baffling misstep: a musical. Yes, you read that right-a musical that somehow manages to gut the intensity and nihilism that made the original Joker such a cultural phenomenon. And not just a musical, but a disappointing one, where the songs are as forgettable as a dropped cup of coffee on a rainy day in Gotham.

First off, the music. Remember when we thought Joker was about gritty realism, descending madness, and psychological torment? Well, Folie à Deux throws that out the window in favor of ...show tunes? The songs come across as half-baked, neither catchy nor deep, with no lasting resonance. You won't leave the cinema humming the tunes because, frankly, there's nothing to hum. It's almost like the filmmakers thought, ""Hey, what if we took all the tension and grim beauty of the original and drowned it in unremarkable piano chords and lyrics that sound like they were penned in a day?"" The result is a soundtrack that feels as relevant to Joker's original film noir aesthetic as a karaoke night in Arkham Asylum.

The original Joker was a gripping exploration of mental illness, social decay, and the creation of a monster-a character study with noir influences, dark alleyways, and eerie lighting that matched its protagonist's crumbling psyche. It thrived in its starkness, its minimalism, and its refusal to hold your hand or sing to you about what you're meant to feel. But in Folie à Deux, we get elaborate musical numbers that feel misplaced, unnecessary, and at odds with the bleakness that worked so well before. It's almost like someone saw La La Land and thought, ""You know what this gritty psycho-drama needs? Jazz hands!"" Because that'll totally fit, right?

The songs themselves do nothing to advance the story, nor do they provide insight into the characters. This isn't Les Misérables where the musical format elevates the narrative to emotional heights. No, here the musical numbers act as speed bumps, derailing any chance at building tension or atmosphere. Just when you think you're about to dive back into the intense psychological drama that made the first film so compelling, bam! Here comes an awkward duet that screams ""filler"" rather than ""emotional depth.""

And let's talk about the character of Harley Quinn. Sure, she's always been quirky, but the way her character is introduced and utilized in Folie à Deux feels like a watered-down Broadway version of the chaotic, unpredictable force of nature she's supposed to be. Instead of pushing the Joker deeper into madness, she dances along in a subplot that seems only half-interested in the descent into insanity that Joker should be. Lady Gaga's performance is fine, but it's hard to tell if it's the casting or the musical numbers themselves that make her feel like she belongs in a different movie altogether.

If you went into Joker expecting the tragic elegance of noir, the dissonance of Folie à Deux will hit you like a clown car driving through a funeral procession. The dark cinematography, the brooding score from the first film, all replaced with flashy, glitzy numbers that don't know what they're doing in this story. There's no thematic continuity."
10.0,3 October 2024,"I recommend this movie with caveats...

1. If you saw the first Joker movie, and you hated it, you will also not like this Joker movie.

2. This is not a traditional or comic accurate version of The Joker. It is a unique interpretation of the character. He is not the enjoyably psychotic clown prince criminal mastermind and he is not the psychotic agent of chaos who just wants to watch the world burn. Joker in this series is mentally ill, and not the sharpest tool in the shed. If you can't accept that this is a very different take on the character, you will not like this movie.

3. The music plays a big role in the narrative, though I wouldn't classify it as a musical. If you can't tolerate musical sequences, you will not like this movie.

4. This movie is a tragedy that takes its subject matter deathly serious. I did not laugh once, not even at the cartoon at the beginning. This is not fun to watch. If you aren't in the mood for a serious commentary on society and the mentally ill, you will not like this movie. Do not go into this expecting a fun and psychotic Jack Nicholson or Mark Hamill Joker. The cartoon at the beginning is misleading. The tone of this movie can in NO way be described as ""fun.""

Only if you can pass these four hurdles, do I recommend this movie to you.

The best way to describe it is as a social commentary on the fetishization of violent crime and its effect on the mentally ill. The story is told from Arthur Fleck/Joker's perspective as a mentally ill inmate awaiting trial whose legal counsel is trying to get him out of prison and into a mental institution.

The movie is scant, throughout its run, on details about what's been going on in the outside world. The narrative mostly follows Arthur Fleck's perspective, including hallucinations and fantasy sequences, which are intentionally designed to make the audience think about how much of what is going on is real and how much is in the character's head. What details the audience receives about the larger picture are all perceptions that Fleck has from radio and television broadcasts he hears and watches, what he's able to glean from what's going on in the courtroom, what the guards and his counsel tell him, and what he hears from a psychopath he falls in love with. (Harley Quinn)

The polarizing musical sequences are all mentally ill hallucinations of Fleck falling in love with Quinn. They're important to the movie, but the bulk of the film is a courtroom/prison drama, hence why I don't classify it as a musical even though it features musical sequences and they are important to the story.

As the movie is very much in Fleck's headspace, it doesn't exactly follow a traditional narrative structure. You are essentially watching a man with a serious mental illness trying to process his own conflicting thoughts and emotions. Who's good? Who's evil? Who's on his side? Are people just using him? Is he the Joker? Is he Fleck? Does he have multiple personality disorder? Is Harley really in love with him? Is she just using him? Is his counsel on his side? Is society on his side?

All of these insecurities are brought to light through the structure of the narrative. It's all Fleck trying to process the media frenzy that his trial becomes. It's all Fleck trying to process his feelings for Harley. It's all Fleck trying to figure out who he really is. The musical sequences all serve to show Fleck's inner conflict and how he's processing everything in his head. He is very much an unreliable narrator and the audience has to interpret for themselves the actual truth of what's going on.

Joaquin Phoenix does a fantastic job in this role. You can really feel Fleck's journey as he tries to process everything that's going on. Lady Gaga also does a decent job as his femme fatale, Harley Quinn.

I was very interested in the social commentary the movie provides. The media tends to treat violent criminals like celebrities, giving them special attention and television movies. It's almost a fetishization of violent crime, and nowhere is this more present than in the character of Harley Quinn, who literally has a fetish for Joker. The counterculture of social unrest that seems to be present in Gotham seems to have latched on to this media attention and is trying to make Joker a martyr as a symbol of their own frustration. Almost everyone in the movie wants to use Joker for their own ends, and ignores what would be best for Fleck, confusing him, making him question what is right and wrong, who he is, and who he isn't, and it's just fascinating to see it from Fleck's perspective as he tries to process it.

Overall, I do strongly recommend the movie if you can get over the four hurdles I mentioned in the opening. It's not fun, but I liked it. I thought the first movie was an interesting take on the character, and I think this movie is just as interesting a take with a more interesting social commentary. 9/10."
7.0,5 October 2024,"Back in 2019, Writer/Director Todd Phillips teamed with actor Joaquin Phoenix to create an interesting, dark, multi-level character named Arthur Fleck in JOKER. This character was so compelling that Phoenix (rightfully) won the Oscar for best Actor and Phillips (rightfully) was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar. So, what do Phillips and Phoenix do to ""up the ante"" in the inevitable sequel?

Why, make it a musical, of course.

Picking up after the events of the first film where Arthur Fleck is awaiting trial while incarcerated at Arkham Asylum for the murders he committed in the first film, JOKER: FOLIE A DEUX focuses on the relationship that Arthur strikes up with ""SuperFan"" Lee Qunizel (Lady GaGa) and the sparks and chaos that ensue.

Or do they? For this movie focuses on the blurred lines of fantasy vs. Reality that these 2 live in - and the musical numbers emphasize the fantasy portion of it.

One needs to be a very certain type of viewer to enjoy the musical aspect of this film - you need to be a Dark Comic Book Movie fan that also enjoys Movie Musicals of the 1950's. This just happens to be me, so I really enjoyed the Musical numbers that were grounded in ""reality"" (at least, the reality of these 2 characters) while also helping to move the story forward and to enhance the characters and the relationships of Arthur and Lee.

As for the performances, Phoenix is terrific (of course) as Arthur. The problem is that one is going to judge his performance against his previous, Oscar-winning performance and it just doesn't measure up (mostly because of the script - more on that later). However, his singing is a pleasant surprise. Sure, at times it falls into ""talk singing"" (aka Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY), but Phoenix acts his way through the songs and the roughness of his voice in his musical numbers works for his character.

However, Phoenix has an issue in this movie that he didn't in the first Joker film, he has a VERY strong performer to work against and the performance that Lady Gaga gives as Lee just might be a Oscar worthy performance here. Her Lee Quinzel is layered, nuanced and interesting and (as one might imagine) she slips in and out of the musical numbers with ease and when it is her time to shine, musically, she shows that she is...well...Lady Gaga!

Where this movie really fails, though, is in the script that Phillips wrote with Scott Silver. This film is, in essence, a courtroom drama - and a thin one at that - and Phillips and Silver just don't have the depth of character or circumstance that makes one care much about what is happening on the screen and though Phoenix and GaGa try mightily to elevate this film above the thin script that they are given, this film ultimately, falls apart like a cheap shirt in the wash.

And...don't get me started about the ""deus ex machina"" ending that seemed to come out of nowhere!

So...if you're a musical theater and dark comic book movie person this film just might intrigue you, if not, knock 2 points off my grade below.

Letter Grade: B (for me), probably a C for everyone else.

1.0,4 October 2024,"I had high hopes for the new Joker movie, especially with Lady Gaga starring in it, but unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. I was expecting a dark, thrilling experience, but instead, it turned out to be more of a musical than anything else. There was no real action or suspense, which is shocking considering it's a Joker movie.

How can you make a movie about such a notorious character without any edge or excitement? It felt like the film dragged on with no real payoff. I wanted to enjoy it so badly, but it ended up being completely boring. I honestly wish I hadn't spent the money to see it.

Overall, it lacked the intensity and thrill that you expect from a Joker movie. What a letdown!"
6.0,7 October 2024,"Don't get me wrong, this film is by no means an outstanding sequel, but it makes a statement in its own right.

The positives: Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's performances were stellar, and the musical score added an ominous tone that fit the film well.

Music: Some viewers have complained about the disjointed transitions between the plot and musical sequences. I also found these moments quite jarring, but part of me feels this may have been intentional. The film is bleak and disturbing, and the musical interludes, while out of place at times, might have been meant to reflect that. However, the musical segments could have been trimmed, given the film's already lengthy runtime. Songs like ""If You Go Away"" and ""To Love Somebody"" felt overly sentimental, in my opinion.

Film duration: The movie is quite long, and some sequences could have been shortened. There were numerous drawn-out scenes of Arthur simply walking or staring out from inside a car, which slowed the pacing.

Character development: Lee's character felt underdeveloped. I'm not sure if this was the director's intention, but it left me wanting more depth.

In summary: This is an unusual film that deserved a stronger ending, though I don't believe it warranted the level of criticism it received."

The musical parts didn't really threw me off guard cause I knew what I was walking into.

It's a good visual movie but feels forced, Joker 2019 didn't needed a sequel!

The acting was very good yet I wasn't a big fan of Lady Gaga's character cause it felt like she didn't really needed to be in this movie or had anything special to bring to the table. Besides from her characters name and popularity.

It has more potential but it was a average comic book movie and not the worst one.

Got some rethinking to do, gotta be around a 7.

Go see it for yourself."

1.0,2 October 2024,"The movie has tried their best to milk ""joker"" part:1 as much as possible, not bone chilling like it's prequel at all. The while movie was a complete revision of part one, and revolved around those crimes alone. No newer elements are added, except for the musical theme (felt more like a spoof of la la land). Always gave fake hopes for a bigger element but they couldn't deliver it.

The movie story has lost its element from the main protagonist. More focus was driven onto 'joker is not joker and the jokes on you'.

The story couldn't do justice to Joaquin phoenix's performance. And combined with lady gaga made a complete disaster.

The musical theme of the movie makes it worse.

I believe this could be a prior plot to some bigger story that could be introduced. But watching the sequel to this without watching this part would be no loss at all."
9.0,3 October 2024,"This. Was. Incredible. I was locked in from beginning to end, utterly captivated by the amazing performances, the beautiful camera work, and the mesmerizing score. I went into this film with incredibly high expectations but also very deep worries that it would come off as pretentious, confusing, and unable to justify its own existence. Suffice it to say, those worries were quelled, and those expectations were met. I had a blast watching this film from beginning to end. From the absolutely beautiful performances from Phoenix and Gaga, to the incredibly engaging and truly bold writing, there wasn't a single dull moment to be found. While it isn't a stand alone story that speaks for itself like the first film, this feels like a fantastic epilogue tying up the loose ends of the first film while bringing a few new ingredients of its own that do warrant this being a full fledged two and a half hour film rather than a special or short film on HBO Max. While yes the first film had a perfect ending and didn't need a sequel, I'm very glad we got one because there was clearly much more of a story to tell. The ending to this film I feel like is what will be the most controversial and divisive among fans, but for me I felt like it was the only way for the film to end. If you can't tell I absolutely adored this film and really hope it gets the same love from audiences and the academy the first film did. Is it better than the first film? Probably not, but it's close. I think the first is a better film on its own merrits and tells a more self contained story with more to say about mental health and society, but it's also much more difficult to watch because of how heavy and intense the film is, but when it comes to which film I would rather rewatch, I'd pick this one any day of the week. It's simply more entertaining and easier to watch. That does mean it loses some of that shock value the first film had and I can see that being a big issue for many audiences, but for me I thought it worked really well. This film isn't trying to be as shocking as the first, and it's not trying to be better either. It's simply complimenting the first film and giving this legendary character (both in universe and in real life) the send off he truly deserves. I adored this film and will absolutely be seeing it again as soon as humanly possible."

2.0,4 October 2024,"Joker 2 takes everything that was brilliant about the original and throws it away in favor of a misguided attempt to hype Lady Gaga's image. What could have been a deep, thought-provoking continuation of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness is ruined by turning it into an unnecessary musical. The dark, gritty atmosphere that made Joker special is completely lost, replaced by flashy musical numbers that feel out of place and disrupt the tone. The plot is a mess, seemingly written just to showcase Gaga, turning a great idea into a shallow spectacle. A frustrating waste of potential and of my time actually."
1.0,4 October 2024,"It's incredibly disappointing to say, but Joker 2 fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. After the phenomenal success of Joker (2019), I, like many fans, was eagerly anticipating the sequel. The first film was groundbreaking in its portrayal of mental health, societal unrest, and the psychological descent of Arthur Fleck, brought to life masterfully by Joaquin Phoenix. It was a powerful and darkly emotional story with a stunning narrative arc and visuals that lingered in the mind long after the credits rolled. Naturally, I had high expectations for Joker 2, but unfortunately, the film fell flat in nearly every aspect.

To start, the plot is almost non-existent. Unlike the first movie, which had a compelling story that kept you hooked from start to finish, Joker 2 feels aimless. There's no sense of direction, and the events that unfold seem arbitrary, almost like they're there just to fill time. The narrative doesn't build up to anything meaningful or significant, and there's a lack of the emotional depth that made the original such a standout. Instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, it seems the filmmakers opted for style over substance, and that really diminishes the experience.

One of the biggest issues with Joker 2 is how predictable it is. The first movie was filled with shocking twists and moments that genuinely took you by surprise, but this sequel fails to deliver on that front. You can almost see every scene coming from a mile away, and by the halfway point, the film becomes boring because you know exactly where it's heading. There's no suspense, no tension, and nothing to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's frustrating to sit through a movie where every plot point is telegraphed long before it happens, and that's exactly what Joker 2 does.

Character development is another area where Joker 2 falls short. In the original, we witnessed Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker in a slow, methodical way that felt earned and organic. In this film, however, the characters seem stagnant. There's no growth or evolution, and they don't go through any significant challenges or changes that would make them interesting. Even Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which was the highlight of the first film, feels subdued and lacking in intensity this time around. It's almost as if the actor is going through the motions without the passion and commitment he had previously shown.

The pacing of the film is also a major issue. It drags on, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. Scenes feel drawn out for no reason, and the film never really builds any momentum. By the time you reach the climax, you're left feeling underwhelmed because the movie never really earns its big moments. It's difficult to stay engaged when the film keeps losing steam every few minutes, and that's something Joker 2 never manages to overcome.

Overall, Joker 2 is a huge disappointment. It lacks the heart, soul, and depth of its predecessor, and instead of building on the success of the first film, it feels like a watered-down version with none of the originality or impact. The story is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the film is plagued by predictability and poor pacing. If you were excited about this sequel, I'd suggest tempering your expectations because, unfortunately, it falls far short of what made the first movie so special. In the end, Joker 2 is a letdown, and not worth the time or money to see in theaters."
6.0,3 October 2024,"I have just seen the film in the movies and all i watched was about Arthur trying to both take control of himself and go deeply inside him. There was no Harley Quinn in the film. I find the performance of Phoenix as masterpiece to both the joker and Arthur but there is basically no such a big comparison to the first movie. The way the film has been shot, is stunning, which leads it to the fact that the subgoal of the joker has been buried behind the musical aspects. Ultimately my opinion on the second sequel to the first one is such a disappointment that cannot expressed appropriately. I would like you all to share your revies on this to me."
1.0,4 October 2024,"I was highly disappointed with Joker 2. I expected much more from the characters, especially the Joker, who felt utterly mishandled. The depth and complexity that made him captivating in the first film were replaced with a shallow and confusing portrayal. The storyline was disjointed, and an overwhelming amount of music was often distracted from critical scenes rather than enhancing them. The pacing dragged, and pivotal moments felt forced. Overall, the movie was a disaster and failed to live up to the potential of the iconic character. This movie was a musical, not a good film as everyone had expected."
7.0,7 October 2024,"If you aren't into musicals then this isn't for you most likely as I believe that is what everyone's ""hate"" is towards this movie. Which honestly idk why because they said it was going to be a musical when they first announced this film like last year.

Secondly, tired of people saying ""this isn't living up to the first"" or ""it's not what they 'set' up for"". If anyone watched the interviews and with Tod Philips mentioning he had NO PLANS of making a 2nd film neither did Joaquin.

But they took a different approach and honestly to me who loves the first this movie makes perfect sense.

Some ask where the story is? Are you even watching? Or are you just criticizing every scene and not letting yourself go?

Anyone knows the comics and these two relationship shouldn't have expected anything different or new.

It's a live action, dark comedy, drama, crime and psychological film.

He was captured and put into Arkham Asylum/Hospital in the end of the last one.

This shouldn't be news to anyone that you are viewing someone's life via an insane asylum for an entire movie and getting their perspective. The musical elements are mentioned as to why they are used in the movie as well at Harley's class, they use music for a form of therapy and it makes sense.

The entire movie is his life in the asylum lost and trying to cope with whatever his life was. Then he finds love and has meaning again in his life and they use a musical to portray his feelings and her's. They are both in a hospital and playing out their fantasies for the most part in their minds so why does that not seem like a good way to approach it?

It builds up towards the third act and the last bit is super sad but when and IF you can open your mind and realize these are mental health patients expressing themselves then maybe you will understand and appreciate the movie better.

I'm so sick and tired of movies getting hate and people find like 1 thing to make it sound like the entire movie is ruined because of it.

I don't care for musicals but I do for dark ones such as Sweeney Todd with Johnny Depp. If you enjoyed that one then you'll enjoy Joker 2.

This film almost could have been a stand alone to if it didn't rely on repeating his crimes from the first film because even Arthur Fleck said he is done focusing on his past.

Anyways that's my two cents. Do what you will and listen to critics or go see it for yourself and go in open minded."
1.0,18 October 2024,"I have never been an interactive audience during experiencing a film in the cinema. 2nd weekend here in Kuala Lumpur on a Thursday night has only sold 4 seats in a luxurious IMAX setting.

Joker Folie A Duex is as much a flop all across the globe, universally panned and deserving so.

What absolutely self indulging piece of rubbish with a middle finger shoved into audiences face throughout it felt watching this mess.

Music including Jacques Brul's ""If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas)"" was simply too much to handle towards the end.

The selection or cover makes no musical sense as a whole. Reminds me of Moulin Rouge verging on cringe.

Many a scene a waste of IMAX's film stock.

We (my mate) really wanted to like it despite what we heard, everyone was right!

Avoid at all cost !

Thank u.

6.0,13 October 2024,"Before I watched Joker 2 yesterday (12.10.2024) I started to read/watch/listen different critics and negative feedback in 3 diffrerent languages on different sources (specialized news channel, youtube, insta reels etc), which make me worry little bit.

After summarizing all of them, I could conclude that majority of the reviewers were not happy (not aware at all) that movie is MUSICLE. News about that could found in the internet starting from 2022.

SO, before going to this movie or wathing it at home, prepare yourself to this genre and it's specific.

As a musicle, film is not perfect, of course. Some of songs REALLY looks like excessive and added for the sake of chronometrics, but 50-75% songs are OK and bear sense within the plot.

Moreover in between those songs film is still dark, sad and depressive with it's narrative about sick and travmatized person.

Don't look into HL Joker in this movie, you won't find it.

It's completely different movie which is more about Arthur Flek as a person, rathen than Joker as character and villian mastermind.

Still I found it's comedic and unfair that Joker 2 considered worse films that Morbius and Madame Web.

As I comic fan, who watched every comic movie from Marvel/DC since 2000, I could say this move is FAR better, better operator work, better soundtrack and actor's play compared to those 2 movies.

So, If you interested to the continiuos of the story/character from the 1st movie and tolerate musicle don't skip this film."
1.0,12 October 2024,"I am not disappointed that they made a second movie, knowing the DC universe it is bound to happen, I am disappointed that they made a second movie that looks bad. Did they really need to do a bad movie? What is the other purpose other than humiliating us fans that liked the movie so much? They just shove in our faces ""hey look what I can do with something you like, *r#pe joker in front of the audience*"". Joker is a villain I get it, he deserves all the worst that can happen to him, but a musical really? If they beat Joker with a crowbar it would be more respectable with the character. I feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix he didn't deserve this, this movie is going to be a stain in his career that will follow him forever and it is not even his fault that the movie is bad."
10.0,4 October 2024,"This movie is one of my favorites because it perfectly shows how psychologists try to portray a hero as sick, stripping away his Joker identity to make him conform to societal norms. The Joker's persona is integral to his very being, and as soon as that identity is taken from him, everything in his world begins to unravel.

The film offers a deep philosophical take on identity, authenticity, and society's need to control what it doesn't understand. Critics may have misunderstood this message, which might explain the low ratings. Ironically, these same critics rated flashy films like Deadpool highly, overlooking this film's complex layers and meaning. By showing the Joker's transformation, the movie challenges our perceptions of heroes, villains, and the consequences of forcing individuals into rigid molds."
6.0,2 October 2024,"Rating: 6.6 Overall, a clear cash grab as this movie does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe and ruins the unique, open-ended brilliance of 'Joker'; but it is a decent watch for its cinematography, visuals, technicals, and acting.

Direction: Pretty Good The direction on a macroscale is great as he uses cinematography and imagery to really paint the screen and build the world; the direction on a microscale is not that strong as it feels like it is kind of rehashing what they did in the last film, and the interpersonal scenes between Phoenix and Gaga were not that amazing; the storytelling is a lot less innovative as last time as they really don't subvert your expectations because the movie just goes through the progressions; the use of music and musical numbers to help tell the story was not that strong as it really only hurt the movie by moving away from what was going on; they build tension well as they still use score and cinematography to help with this, but it feels like this is just using experience from the last film

Story: Bad The concept is not that great; it is not that original, and really just feels like a cash grab; the movie does not really provide anything new to these characters and just shows why there should not have been a sequel; the idea of having this be a jukebox musical really kinda backfired in the end because it did not feel like it was executed well and took away from the charm of the first movie; the plot structure is way more linear this time around and pretty predictable, with the interjections in musical numbers being the only thing that deviates from the linear structure; the character writing is not that great this time around as it does not provide any additional depth to Arthur Fleck; it honestly makes his character worse as they took away a lot from what made the character interesting in the first film, and Lee really just feels like an uninteresting interpretation of Harley Quinn; this story really hurts the first movie as the predecessor no longer has an open-for-interpretation ending

Screenplay: Pretty Good The dialogue is alright for the most part, but has a lot of corny and cringey lines that really stand out and make the movie feel pretentious; the humor is not as strong this time around, but does have some noteworthy moments; there are so many illusions and homages in this movie as the movie references like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Psycho' while also referencing important historical trials like Ted Bundy and Billy Milligan, but it does so in a little too overt manner at times; the symbolism is not as strong as the previous movie as there really isn't anything to take away from this movie; the foreshadowing is not as strong as the first movie as they really plant seeds that never come out, kinda subverting our expectations by being predictable this time around

Acting: Good Joaquin Phoenix: Good to Very Good (Uses a lot of his experience from playing to role to help define this character and feels like he never left in the more dramatic scenes, but does not really hold his own well in the musical numbers; does not have the best chemistry with Lady Gaga; does not feel like he was given as much runway to work with this time around) Lady Gaga: Good (Does very well in the music numbers and holds her own well; is not really given that much material to really show off and stand alone outside of Phoenix's performance; does not have the best chemistry with Phoenix) Brendan Gleeson: Good (Has a surprisingly charismatic performance and has good chemistry with Phoenix) Catherine Keener: Pretty Good to Good (Plays her role well and has good chemistry with Phoenix) Zazie Beetz: Pretty Good (Really just a cameo) Rest of the cast: Pretty Good (Supports the main cast well and shows the different faces of Gotham)

Score: Very Good Still has a lot of the same themes as the first movie and is still used to create tension, it is just used way less than the first movie

Soundtrack: Decent The song selection was pretty good; it is just the musical numbers were pretty hit or miss; I enjoyed the grand dance sequence numbers that felt like non-sequiturs, but felt like the singing in the middle of scenes really took away from the film

Cinematography: Incredible The best part of the movie, as I felt, was the cinematography; it really painted the screen with stunning visuals and was effectively used to display imagery to make this movie feel like an art piece; Some of my favorite shots were the 'Singing in the Rain' reference, the pills making a smile, the smile with the lipstick on the glass, and the courtroom scene where Arthur is out of focus but you see his face looking at the audience from the video-camera screen; The use of IMAX shots was done well as this was mostly used to show grand sequences, inside Arthur's mind, or the musical numbers; The color grading was really nice in helping show the dark, colorless side of Gotham

Editing: Great Used very well in conjunction with the cinematography to make this movie visually appealing and an art piece

Sound: Very Good Used well to build tension and show some of the action sequences; the constant laughing and distant sounds in the background really helped us feel like we are inside Arthur's mind as he constantly hears thoughts

Visual Effects: Good Helped paint the world of Gotham; the pyrotechnics and practice effects felt fine, but not that surprising

Production Design: Very Good Really enjoyed how they created Gotham (basically New York City) and Arkham Asylum; really enjoyed some of the sets for the musical scenes as they felt like they paid homage to the 50s and 60s; the production design as a whole did not feel as amazing/iconic as the last movie

Makeup: Very Good Helped paint and create the Joker and Harley Quinn

Costumes: Very Good Helped paint and create the Joker and Harley Quinn

Pacing Pacing was good for the most part, as the movie felt like it was getting through a lot of plot in such a short runtime; the climax could have been cut a little

Climax The climax was poorly executed, as it felt like it did not end the movie well, as it felt like nothing interesting happened; the sequel was definitely more straightforward and not as iconic or innovative as the first movie

Tone Tone is not good as it tries to be a musical while simultaneously trying to be an auteur-driven psychological thriller; the former really hurts the intentions of the latter as it does neither very well

Final Notes I really felt like this movie wasn't necessary going into the movie and I feel this way even more after watching the movie; this movie just feels like a cash grab as it does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe; the idea of having a sequel really hurts the open-ended nature of the first movie and kinda makes it worse in retrospect."
1.0,5 October 2024,"After waiting 5 years for the sequel to the original Joker (2019), I felt that this simply was not what I nor many others were looking for. The first film, starring Joaquin Phoenix was a veritable masterpiece that left the audience chomping at the bit for more. It was an elegant commentary on the downfall of society in a fictitious New York City, and the outcasts that were shadows, ignored by the elites, with a heavy look into mental health. This continuation was none of that. It lacked direction and the tempo was inconsistent. Every time a storyline would get going and the audience was drawn in, there would be yet another musical number, turning a flowing movie into a staccato of disconnect. This film feels like a loose Joker story that's been precariously wrapped around a Lady Gaga album, and not her good ones either. There was very little that redeems this movie, apart from the sets and costuming. Phoenix is an amazing, talented actor, but even he could not make this series rise from the ashes."
5.0,3 October 2024,"The movie tries to get meta, making the audience the focus, represented by public who show up to the Joker's trial for entertainment and then director deliberately pis*es in your face.

There's a movie where this could have worked, but this isn't it.

The performances are strong, but they can't save a script that seems more interested in antagonising fans of the first movie who are constantly teased about what the movie could have been before launching into another mediocre musical number.

If you were a fan of the first Joker, you might be intrigued to see the sequel despite the poor reviews, but save your money and time for the the digital release."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I loved the first Joker so I was really looking forward to seeing this, but it was such a disappointment. There's really not much that happens, minimal character development. I'm ok with how the Joker storyline goes in this version but this movie could have replaced a lot of the random musical daydreams (which added very little to anything) and spent more time on Arthur's mental trauma (which is where Phoenix shines) or on the romance with Harley. Lady Gaga was great but she's so much more than a singer and this movie didn't give her much to show off her acting skills. And other characters in the movie were barely more than props."
1.0,3 October 2024,
7.0,7 October 2024,"Since the moment Folie à Deux was announced I feel like the narrative around it has been that it just didn't need to happen. I would combat that by saying no movie has ever had to happen, the first Joker didn't have to happen but in this movies case I just really struggled to understand the appeal behind continuing the story of that first film. There was just something so beautiful to me about Joker being its own self-contained story and I was mainly worried that the existence of this sequel would undermine so many plot points from the first film that would be better left ambiguous. It's a flawed experience for sure but I kept waiting for the moment that it would lose me and it honestly never came.

I think a large part of that comes down to Todd Phillips' wholly unique vision for this movie. It by no means always works but it always kept my interest. Making this a musical is a bold idea but made total sense to me given how important music was to the first film. I personally liked that it was a jukebox musical, I thought it kept the tone closer to that of the first movie, and as obviously great as Lady Gaga was in those moments Joaquin Phoenix brought out that aspect of the character in outstanding ways. I just found those sequences to be inserted in really clunky ways and for as impressively realised as they are it just left me feeling like a lot of them could've been removed and it wouldn't really have affected the flow that much.

Honestly I would say for the first hour or so I as totally onboard with what this movie was trying to do. Everything that takes place within the confines of the prison were brutally well realised and I feel like it gives us a version of the Joker we've never seen before. It made this movie feel more standalone and less like it's trying to retread the beats from the original. It's after the first hour, when we get more scenes outside of the prison where things start to become uneven. It essentially becomes 3 or 4 films in one and it massively bogs down the pacing. It can drag considerably because so many scenes feel like they're unnecessarily long and it made me not as consistently engaged as I wanted to be. The court room stuff took a while to become interesting for me but once it did I found a lot of the call backs to the first film to be more impactful and less like it was just a recap of events.

I also don't know that I ever found the insertion of Gaga's Harley Quinn to be as successful as it could've been. I thought her and Phoenix had great chemistry and I always bought the connection between those characters but I never really felt like she came into her own. Her appearances become more sporadic as the film goes on and I kept waiting for the moment where she had a real impact on the actual events but it never came to be. I wasn't a huge fan of how her arc ended and I have to be honest and say that the final scene left me very mixed. It's a bold swing that did have an effect on me and I can see what Phillips was going for but nothing in this film or the first one leads me to believe that this is what they were ultimately building towards.

From the moment Folie à Deux was announced I questioned if Joker really needed a sequel and having seen the actual film now I still don't feel like I have an answer to that question. It is a very interesting experience that mostly held my attention and I ultimately admired the story that Todd Phillips was trying to tell here. Nothing about this film offends me as a fan of the first but I couldn't help but scratch my head at some of the decisions that were made. For as many scathing reviews as this movie has been getting, I am surprised that I left feeling more positive than most. Maybe this movie should never have been made but for better or worse I don't think it's going to leave my mind anytime soon."
2.0,5 October 2024,"Joker 2024 was a huge letdown. The movie dragged on endlessly, with scenes that felt pointless and left me checking the time more than once. The waiting time for something exciting to happen was unbearable, and the pacing made the entire film boring. I found myself on the verge of sleeping through the middle, as it failed to hold any real tension or intrigue. Many parts of the plot felt like non-sensical twists, trying too hard to be profound, but coming off as confusing and empty. Overall, it was a horrible viewing experience, lacking the brilliance of the original. I really really hate the fact I didnt left the room earlier."
6.0,4 October 2024,"This one is hard to review but I will start to say it's not as bad as people said it was going to be:

Review : I didn't understand the criticism of the movie until the end that ruined all that was built up in the first movie in my opinion.

If it had a better ending it would be one those great Sequel's moment, but unfortunately it wasn't:/ Pros- The cinematography and Set design were some of the best I have ever seen.

Cons- some weird Creative choices and the bad ending.

Summary : All trough the movie isn't as bad as people make it out to be they ruined a other wise great movie, unfortunately.

2,5/3."
4.0,8 October 2024,"It seems as if the audience is being punished for enjoying, celebrating and supporting JOKER 2019. This sequel was a disrespectful and malicious take on the Joker. The movie was mainly divided into three parts being prison, courtroom and musical all of which robs the Joker of any personal agency. At no point did we get a display of the criminal mastermind, psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor that are staple characteristics of a the villain we have come to know and love. Furthermore, there is an added frustration because the level of financial investment, production and quality acting is evident. If you have any affinity with previous versions of the Joker this movie will annoy and aggravate you. I recommend that you save your time and money."
10.0,5 October 2024,
7.0,6 October 2024,Started so well but when you realised that it's just a prison drama it quickly lost its pace and appeal. And why oh why out of the thousands of actors available did they cast Alan Partridge as the interviewer ... at that point the film lost all credibility. What a shame as the lead characters were played perfectly by Phoenix and Gaga - loved the musical element to the film and this took it on an interesting journey to begin with but as the movie progressed this wore off and it was a case of repeating the the same scene over and over. It seems the directors were given too much leeway based on the success of the first movie. It's worth a watch but wait until Netflix ... no need to rush out and see it.
1.0,5 October 2024,"What did I just watch? There was no story. It was all pure imagination. Lady Gaga is mid. She isn't Harley Quinn. She' looked lik a mental illness patient instead. The history of Harley and Joker don't even sing. They made the movie very musical. It's very bad. Go watch Terrifier 3. It's going to be better than the mid Joker 2 movie. I hope Todd never directs again. Imagine he going to marvel lol. Idk who's worse at directing? Patty Jenkins or Todd Philips. Stop letting some directors who don't have good resume of writing, write a script. Seriously, it's freaking bad. I can't wait when someone else plays Harley Quinn."
1.0,1 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" certainly sings a different tune than its predecessor, but it isn't an encore worth sticking around for.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance is showcasing his incredible range and commitment to the character. The film's haunting score adds another layer of depth, creating an unsettling and atmospheric experience. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessor. While Phoenix's performance and the film's score are undeniably brilliant, the narrative and creative choices ultimately detract from the overall.

Gaga doesn't quite reach the mania that Harley Quinn ought to have but still packs a wallop where it counts. She doesn't have as much to work with, but her Grammy-winning vocals do help propel the biggest set pieces to explosive heights. The introduction of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn initially sparks intrigue, but their dynamic fails to fully ignite, leaving their relationship feeling underdeveloped. The film's musical numbers, while ambitious, feel jarring and disrupt the flow of the narrative, creating an uneven and tonally inconsistent experience. The plot itself lacks the depth and complexity of the original, often relying on shock value rather than meaningful exploration of its themes.

""Folie à Deux"" had its moments, with some solid scenes, but the ending really fell flat. It feels like it was building up to something great, only to drop the ball in the final act. Definitely not as strong as I hoped and a step down from the his predecessor. Could be worth a watch, but don't expect the same impact as the first.

Overall it's an overindulgent musical that lacks the punch of its predecessor."

Meg 2 was a better sequel! Yes it's that bad, no story nothing this film can't be compared to anything else because it's not a thriller or a comedy or a musical!!

It flutters back and forth into daydreams which makes zero sense, Lady Gaga is more annoying than anything else! Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn now looks like the best acting ever.

The court scene when Arthur puts on a Southern accent is absolutely cringe.

This is I assume trying to be an arty type??

The fact the cinema was practically empty shows that the clever people read reviews before attending.

I want a refund Mr Phillips."

6.0,6 October 2024,"First off, I didn't have a problem with the musical interludes of the film. They were self aware, stopping short of dragging on and giving an additional dimension madness amongst the looming destruction.

The performances are solid all round. The pacing is calculated, allowing us contemplation on Arthur's character and what his new relationship with Quinzel will mean.

However, despite what seems like a broiling build up to a cacophony of insanity, this film ultimately bails at its last hurdles and even puts to bed any expectations that another sequal could be the explosive conclusion to a trilogy. Where the original topped off with a bold and manacing statement, this one pulls away. Yet again, this seems entirely self aware. It's a subversion tactic that no one expected but no one wanted, either.

We wanted Joker. We got Arthur Fleck."

10.0,3 October 2024,"In a post-pandemic world, where ""box office bombs"" have become so common, and movies based on comic books are in steep decline with audiences, making a musical and, in a way, a courtroom drama in the acclaimed Joker universe seems like a bold decision, and long live boldness! Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga shine, period. The madness of their characters is so well portrayed that it is sometimes painful and sad to watch. The musical numbers, as perfect as they are uncomfortable, are always overshadowed by the pains of mental illness, marginalization, and self-hatred. Joker: Folie à Deux is proof that cinema can still surprise, disturb, and dare. Rating: 10/10."
7.0,6 October 2024,"I'm surprised to find this movie with such a low average rating, but I'm truly convinced that the people rating this film with a low score are the kind of people that believe movies like The Fast and the Furious and The Transformers to be peak cinema. Was this movie very different from the first one? Yes. Was it a musical? Also, yes- by design. Everyone that said it was ""the lady gaga show"" is missing the point entirely. This was also by design, based on the storyline. Joaquin and Gaga did an excellent job at representing their characters. The musical segments represent Arthur's spiraling mind, and the stark contrast between that and his reality. You either get it, or you don't."

The ending of the first movie left so much opportunity to create something amazing especially with Harley Quinn but yet again they just don't give the people what they want. We wanted madness,chaos, we wanted the joker to take over the city etc but instead you give us literally the most pathetic movie. I am beyond disappointed. People walked out of the cinema mid film. I was so lost for words after watching this film it was a complete disappointment and flop. They don't make movies like they use to that's for sure. I think I'll go and re watch the Christian bale batman sequel now to make myself feel better."

4.0,14 October 2024,"What can be said about a movie that is best regarded as never have been made by those that regard the first installment fondly?

The purpose of this sequel was the antithesis of the first film that didn't need any further elaboration if its sole purpose was to further deconstruct and eradicate the character that sparked a movement against a system that has failed everyone even those in power for without proper administration of justice and a sense of what the common good demands society decays and ultimately falls.

So now in the 'conclusion' we just see the usual treatment of the outcast by the system to be subject to further punishment and torture until he is utterly destroyed and when the end comes we can only sigh in relief that there won't be a third film to further emasculate and eviscerate him.

And they can't even make this massacre entertaining to watch... this movie makes Popeye look like a top tier musical."
7.0,8 October 2024,"One thing that this Joker movie taught me is that it really is perfectly fine not to have an open mind about these things and to completely be critical about it.

The 2019 film got away with murder, because Arthur Fleck is not the Joker, or at least not the main DC universe version if you want to get dorky about it (and I always do), but there was enough there to satisfy the geekdom, which is why we loved it!

Then with this sequel, Todd Phillips decided to add more water to an already watered down Joker. Probably would have been best just to call this joint the Clown and leave Batman's Rogue out of it.

Funny thing is there was a lot of potential to appeal to Fanboys, but they did not take it, in a move that felt pompous on the filmmaker's side. If you hate comic book superhero movies that much then why'd you do one?

I did not hate Lady Gaga's version of Harley Quinn, in fact overall her connecting story arch with the joker made this movie worth seeing, but still, this is not the original DC animated Universe version or the comic book version. Truly, this is someone else who may have been better received in another movie.

And to think, my biggest worry going in is that i hate musicals and hoped if Gaga was doing some of it I would tolerate it. Not even worth mentioning it! It does not make sense why it even needed to be a musical. Were the musical ques met to metaphorically allow me to enter the heads of the two main characters or was it a poorly done trick to make a film seem artier and more interesting? Definitely both!

Sometimes lighting can't strike twice and the funniest thing about this film is how far from the mark they missed it!

Don't sit through this."
1.0,18 October 2024,"I loved the first Joker film but I have always thought a sequel was unnecessary and there has been lots of negative responses to Joker: Folie a Deux and I have finally had a chance to see this film and here is my review. The premise of the film sees Arthur Fleck locked up after the events of the previous film and meets someone who gives him a new lease on life.

Main Character Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck and he is really trying here. He still clearly has passion for this role and their are elements of this performance that are similar to the first film. But there just isn't that depth that he had in the first film and the character is completely butchered here. There is no development of his character and it feels like he actually goes backwards and it was really disappointing.

Supporting Characters Brendan Gleeson plays a Security Guard and he is good in the film. He is really unlikeable but the dynamic between him and Arthur is actually pretty interesting, it's just not a huge part of the film and doesn't really get any resolution.

Lady Gaga joins the cast as Lee Quinzel and I thought she was pretty weak here. I didn't care for her dynamic with Arthur and the fact that she doesn't fit the role that she was hired to play and the character was weak. It feels like she was just brought in to sing and no care was taken to her character.

The rest of the cast are given little to work with and some are only in like one scene. The guy playing Harvey Dent did nothing to convince me that he is this iconic comic book character and that was a shame.

Story The story doesn't really exist, it is incredibly messy and doesn't take advantage of the fantastic ending from the previous film. It focuses on the relationship between Arthur and Lee and that is really dull so that doesn't help. The first act of the film could have been removed and the film would be better for sure. The ending of the film is also terrible, it comes across as over indulgent and makes no sense and I hated it.

Script The script has a few chuckle worthy moments and a few darker moments and that managed to salvage a few moments in the film. But overall the writing for this film and the characters isn't good enough and makes all the characters seem worse and poorly written.

Style The film took the bold approach of being a musical and it really doesn't work here. First of all Joaquin Phoenix is a poor singer and it totally goes against the tone of the film. All the intense situations are just broken up by these over the top singing sections which means there was no reason to ever care about anything. The film is way too long as well and really drags making it a pretty dull time at the cinema.

Overall Overall, Joker: Folie a Deux is a bad film that is a huge step down from the previous film. The film is boring, dull and offers nothing new to the table. It feels like a cash grab that failed at that even, don't waste your time on this film.

Rating - 3/10."
7.0,9 October 2024,"The Joker sequel has to be one of the least wanted sequels in a long time - and boy, is it unnescessary!

When I first heard about them making a sequel and making it a musical I was sceptical but still curious with caution to see what they would make of it. The general idea of the jokers mind being portrayed through musical numbers was promising - and very much in character in my opinion. However, the execution of this film was far from great.

Firstly, I want to applaud the performance once again from Joacquin Phoenix who still plays the roll of Arthur Fleck to perfection, he has not phoned it in for this sequel. Lady Gaga made a good contribution too - when she actually gets to act. She has unfortunately not been giving much to act on and the focus is more on the musical aspects, since Lady Gaga is a musician after all. She is a great actress and it's a shame they didn't let her act more.

The cinematography, lighting and assets, choregraphy and music is great in this film.

Where Joker: Folie a Deux really stumbles is in the story department. It really adds NOTHING new to the first film, it's basically the same film as the first one retold. Todd Philips does NOT know how to make good sequels, it seems. An example I can think of is The Hangover films, who did not need sequels, and once they came out, they basically were the same films. No character progression, no additional story features that we did not already know about, it has NO substance what so ever. It's a shame because the musical aspect is really interesting to me. Unfortunately, the story falls flat, does not add anything and the musical numbers also felt quite abrupt at times, like they were just thrown in there for the sake of a musical, which ruined the pacing as well.

This film is not as bad as people depict it to be, however. It's an all right enough film that unfortunately gets bogged down by the awful writing, pacing, and general direction. The ending of this film (no spoiler here) is also a very strange, and to be honest, badly written one. It felt like fan-fiction.

It is completely unnescessary and should not really exist. If you've seen the first one, then you can expect that the second film is just the first one being retold through a courtroom drama / musical numbers. You won't get much out of it. I enjoyed it for what it was, even if it wasn't what I expected, and I don't think this movie is deserving of the low rating it has. It deserves at least a 6, which i base my rating on. I would give it a 6,5 but I can't rate it like that here.

Short summary:

Story - 2/10 Music - 8/10 Acting - 10/10 Cinematography - 8/10."
1.0,12 October 2024,"Why spoil a good movie by making a sequel??!!!! This is so terrible and painful to watch... Don't even bother to watch this... no matter how much you loved the original movie which was a masterpiece....

The music and singing is so bad..... It's deafening.....!!! I wish they never made this movie....don't just make a movie for the sake of making money.... specially with the one's which have been so loved and appreciated.

Hope the rating of this movie makes the producers and directors realise that they did a terrible job. In terms of acting, it's alright. Nothing special. Missed the Joker!!!!!"
9.0,7 October 2024,"As someone who watched and re-watched the first Joker film, I went in with high expectations-and this sequel took me completely by surprise. Instead of rehashing the same formula, it dives deep into the psyche of the character, exploring his shadow-self through a lens of Jungian psychology. The film masterfully immerses you in the experience of those who escape reality through the refuge of fantasy. It left me with chills, goosebumps, and a knot in my throat.

If you're expecting a repeat of the original, you'll likely be disappointed. But if you approach it with an open mind-like we all did with the first Joker-you'll find that this sequel is a brilliant piece of cinematic art in its own right.

Unlike the endless cycle of one-dimensional superhero or supervillain movies that hit theaters year after year, this film takes a completely different approach. Every scene is meticulously crafted and layered, allowing the viewer to peel back the story like an intricately woven tapestry. The film doesn't simply present itself-it invites you to explore it, to delve deeper with each moment, revealing new dimensions and insights with every watch. It's a masterpiece that respects its audience's intelligence and rewards those willing to embrace its complexity."
7.0,10 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a film with slightly different kind of musical elements. The film explores themes of myth, perception, rehabilitation, devotion, and self-sabotage. The plot of this film only discusses what happened after the first film, and in terms of execution it feels sloppy without a clear conclusion. There are too many musical elements in this film, but sometimes the placement and timing are not quite right, which disrupts the plot. We won't see the madness that we saw in the first film often in this film, it's only limited to Arthur's imagination. In terms of character development, it is like in the first film, only Arthur is having an identity crisis again. The cinematography is really really pretty, especially during the musical scenes, with the coloring making it feel a little colorful. In terms of production design, nothing has changed, it's still good. The soundtrack music is really pleasant to listen to, especially combined with the suspense scoring. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is definitely very good, and Lady Gaga's acting is quite impressive. Overall, this isn't a bad film but it's not good either."

4.0,3 October 2024,"""As a longtime Joker fan, this movie is the biggest disappointment of the year. I was expecting a thrilling, dark continuation of the Joker's legacy, but what I got was an awkward, disjointed musical masquerading as a film. Almost half the movie is filled with cringe-worthy musical numbers that feel completely out of place in a Joker film. It's like the filmmakers forgot what kind of character they're dealing with.

Lady Gaga's performance was unbearable - she added absolutely nothing to the movie, and her presence turned it into a ridiculous parody of what it should have been. Casting her was a huge mistake; her character brought no depth, just forced and shallow emotions that cheapened every scene she was in. It felt more like a failed attempt to cash in on her fame than a serious role in a Joker film.

The story is nonsensical, the pacing is dreadful, and the ending... it's one of the most underwhelming conclusions I've ever seen. I walked into the theater excited and left feeling frustrated and cheated. This movie should never have been made in this form, and as a Joker fan, I feel utterly let down. Worst movie of the year, hands down."""
7.0,6 October 2024,"I was not expecting much from this film after reading several critics reviews , but overall I liked the film. It's not really a musical , just a story of a very disturbed character singing sad songs in character. Lady gaga was under utilised as well and could have added a little more fun to the film. She is very talented and her vocal talent is kept in check with the story line as it is.

A very dark film similar to the original , of a sad and lonely man, who suddenly finds that people pay more attention to him when he is the joker. Does he have a split personality or is he just playing up to the publics view of him."
1.0,15 October 2024,"Initially I thought: ""People simply don't get it, but when I watch it I'll understand the vision"". Boy was I wrong. This movie looks and sounds like it's not a Joker movie, but rather a Lady Gaga movie. Not a Harley Quinn movie either, but a Lady Gaga film to try to showcase her singing theater talent. They could have possibly saved the film buy having WAY less musical songs and pushed an actual plot line that mattered. The movie seemed like an absolute waste.

What was even the point of this story and ending when this film is going to do so terribly that they might not be able to make a 3rd film? But I'm actually confused if a 3rd film was even part of the plan. What would you even do in a 3rd film? Do you suddenly have no singing parts? It puts you in such a weird predicament. Such a shame since the first Joker film was a classic. Loved the direction, the darkness, and execution of that film.

Warner Bros is going to go bankrupt if they keep on making bad decisions like this. They had everything on a silver platter to serve up another epic Joker movie and they entirely missed the mark. Who was this movie even targeted towards? They wanted female Lady Gaga fans to fill up the movie theater? One of the most iconic villains in all of comics and they give comic fans this. I just have to assume whoever pushed this as an idea was so out of tune with society. Who thought this was a good idea!? What a Mess. I Was So Looking Forward To This...."

I can't say that the movie being a musical bothered me because it wasn't THAT predominant.

Sure, the storyline lacked discipline and flow at times but it was mesmerizing to see lady gaga and joaquin phoenix. They killed it together.

The movie leaves you confused at first because it takes time to process all that happens.

Its true madness but that's the whole point. Its chaotic in all the ways you didn't know you wanted.

As time passes you will find it brilliant, disturbing and manic. The phrase ""You wouldn't get it"" from the first Joker movie fits perfectly."
1.0,6 October 2024,
10.0,2 October 2024,"A full of heart, well-acted, timely film that will easily divide audiences along multiple subjects. In my opinion, one's overall feelings about the film will be mostly based on one's life experiences, specifically with mental illness, ostracism, idolization tendencies, etc. Audience members will bring their own baggage (or lack there of), which is understandable and the point of presenting art to the masses.

What has surprised me, however, is how shallow critics reviews have so far been and how little this elite, exclusive group utilize their ""critical thinking"" - which I assume is why we call them critics? - when it comes to SUCH an important, reflective, and timely story. One can, despite overall feelings about the film, easily draw parallels between this movie and our heavily divided (and more importantly, heavily opinionated) society; one in which the average person struggles with the need to ""idolize"" and defend their ""idols"" and at the same time, the hasty abandonment/cancellation of the same figures. All without an ounce of fully understanding these people's lives and background.

Without spoiling, I assume the average viewer will at least like this movie, if not love (as said in the first few lines of my review). Those that claim to hate it have so far (in my experience) been those who heavily resonated with the character of Joker (believe me, I also fell and still fall in that category, though for very different reasons) and whose view of Joker is shattered in this movie (kudos to Todd Phillips) as this time it tells a (different) cautionary tale. This is not the first Joker and by no measure should it be telling the same story.

In my opinion, a phenomenally well-acted film with fantastic, raw musical moments (once you understand the purpose of the musical moments, they're nothing short of art). The story is timely and urgent (as mentioned above) and the script, despite being lengthy and at times flawed, is full of heart, touching moments and key lessons. Do yourself a favor and see the film for yourself. Don't turn these critics into little ""Jokers"" that we idolize and whose words we take as end all be all. We need to go back to a society of well-thinking, self-deciding individuals. If you do see it, I truly hope you enjoy it or resonate with it for one reason or another. At the end of the day, much of art is divisive and all of art is thought provoking."
6.0,8 October 2024,"Not as bad as people say but definitely not as good as the original, but that's the point. When a movie makes history, you don't try to recreate that history and this is not what the director tried to do. Though I believe that, if not for the musical parts, the whole trial thing could have a part of the first movie and you get a 3 hour Joker film. But overall, it was a movie I enjoyed watching. Not too much to say here for me. If you haven't watched this film, don't let the haters get to you. I didn't, and I enjoyed it. And that's all that matters when it comes to having fun in the movies, right?"
1.0,5 October 2024,
1.0,1 October 2024,"Despite the characterizations of this film by WB, Todd Phillips, or any other party, it can be unequivocally classified as a musical. Musical interludes, rather than fully developed musical numbers, are interspersed throughout the film, typically lasting between one and one and a half verses. The film was lacking in excitement and entertainment value, particularly when compared to its predecessor. I found it difficult to engage with the narrative and eagerly awaited the musical interludes. There is a moment when someone suggests to cease singing, and I empathize with that sentiment. I believe the audience who was misled into watching this film would share my feelings."

This movie had some great and fun elements and great opportunities but they didn't take advantage of it. This movie could have been way better and be a absolutely masterpiece. The acting was great and cinematography was stunning.

Lady Gaga is a great actress and she could have been a way better Harley Quinn if the story was different.

Joaquin phoenix does a great job again.

Now let's talk about the musical aspects I don't have a problem with musicals, the singing at the beginning wasn't that bad at all but later at the movie it's starts to get annoying and frustrating.

If they removed some of the song scenes and replaced with other scenes that could have been great then this movie would be a lot better.

You can watch the movie in theaters if you want to but you don't need too."
6.0,12 October 2024,"The new Joker movie is a terrible, garbage, waste of time, and horribly disappointing. Despite the immense hype and anticipation, the film fails to deliver on any front. Its plot is convoluted, the pacing is erratic, and the performances feel forced. What could have been a nuanced exploration of the character is instead a shallow attempt at being edgy, leaving viewers frustrated and unsatisfied. The movie tries too hard to be provocative without offering anything of substance, ultimately turning what could have been a compelling narrative into a forgettable mess. Save your time and skip this one."
1.0,7 October 2024,"This film was far from the first and yes it's got its flaws, the music wasn't really needed however it is what it is.. lady gaga was not the correct choice for the role either however the film itself is enjoyable and has amazing cinematography all the way through.. and I'm not sure if people knew the ending and understand what is going on but surely you understood.. let me give a little hint, will the real joker please stand up.. not is as it seems people and when you know what is going on it may enhance the film experience it certainly did for me and I don't get the utter hate for this movie."
8.0,5 October 2024,"It was so boring, it lacked all exciment and the characters have nothing in common with the actual characters.

The constant singing gets insufferable fast.

The first movie was a masterpiece and.this movie was a giant middle finger to all the fans.

I loved the first movie being a more realistic version of the joker and it was both sad and mad and blended it perfectly, which this movie does not, it was just a boring mess. Complete fumble

It should've been called something else and had nothing to do with DC and then it still would've only be a B- movie at best.

This will be known as one of the worst sequels of all time."
7.0,3 October 2024,
1.0,6 October 2024,"Without a doubt, Todd Phillips's ""Joker"" was one of the most intense movies of 2019. That focus on the origins of the Batman villain showed him to be not a villain, but the inevitable result of a society that favors the 1% (and it also made one question whether or not Bruce Wayne ever deserved to get treated as a hero). Joaquin Phoenix rightfully earned his Oscar for the role.

So now we have a sequel. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" works best when addressing the criminal (in)justice system. The musical scenes, meanwhile, look out of place for this kind of movie. There are plenty of movies where it works perfectly for the characters to break out into song - even movies dealing with an unpleasant topic - but it doesn't add anything here, even with Lady Gaga giving it her all as Harley Quinn.

In conclusion, it's not a terrible movie, but still no comparison to the original."
2.0,10 October 2024,"If you're expecting the second Joker movie to be similar to the first, you might be in for a surprise. This film takes a different approach, with a significant portion of it revolving around music. While the first film delved into the darker, psychological aspects of Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker, this sequel shifts focus, blending musical elements and a romantic storyline involving Lady Gaga's character. This change in tone might not resonate with those hoping for a continuation of the intense, gritty atmosphere of the original. While Joaquin Phoenix's performance remains captivating, the deviation from the first film's style may leave some fans feeling let down."
7.0,2 October 2024,"This film? Absolute nightmare. Where do I even begin?

Lazy Writing The script? My god, it's like they didn't even try. It's a Frankenstein of recycled nonsense, slapped together in the cheapest way possible just to keep this franchise on life support. The writing's so lazy it's practically asleep!

Wasted Talent You've got some of the finest actors in Hollywood, and THIS is what you give them to work with? Talk about a waste of talent! It's like giving a Michelin-star chef a frozen pizza to serve. Embarrassing.

Cheap Franchise Grab The whole thing reeks of desperation, like they had no other ideas but knew they could cash in on the name. Cheap. Tasteless. Lacking any substance. If you're going to bring Joker back, at least do it justice! This? Absolute garbage.

Missed Musical Opportunity You decide to make it a musical-great, that could be brilliant! But no, it's barely explored. The music's there as an afterthought, like a garnish on a dish that's already been butchered. Joker's inner chaos through music could've been genius, but instead, it's like they couldn't be bothered to season the damn thing. Bland. Lifeless. A waste of potential.

Too Open - No Speculation The plot? Open-ended to the point of being pointless! It doesn't invite speculation; it invites boredom. There's no depth, no intrigue, nothing to sink your teeth into. It's like serving a raw steak - completely unfinished!

Missed Theme - Truth Gets You Killed They hint at something interesting-that truth gets you killed-but even that's handled like an undercooked piece of meat. Where's the flavor? Where's the development? Nowhere. Just left to rot on the plate.

Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a total waste of time, talent, and potential. It had all the right ingredients but failed miserably to cook them into something even remotely watchable. Disappointing from start to finish."
1.0,5 October 2024,"""Sing Hallelujah, come on, be happy."" Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga) ""Get ready for the judgement day."" Harleen Quinzel, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix)

Who would have thought that the sequel to the original Joker, a multiple Oscar-winning revisionist DC comic book movie, could be anything but joyous? After all, Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, is institutionalized at Arkham Reformatory and awaiting trial for five murders.

Yet, writer director Todd Philips and writers Scott Silver and Bob Kane, with the stellar Phoenix, manage to elicit our sympathy for the murderer, Harley Quinn makes sure Arthur finds love and music to buoy him and us to let the awkward element of a musical bring the humanity out of Arthur.

Not a frame of the more than two hours is wasted on frivolous crime or tears. As Arthur endures the accusations of manipulation and bloodthirst, we see him struggle to explain the duality within himself, which he seemingly doesn't acknowledge anyway. Not until the denouement do we hear from him his analysis of his duality.

Joker: Folie a Deux has multiple moments of confusion about Arthur's mix of evil and sometimes good, especially when he's on the run with Harley, where, a 'la La La Land the couple break into song and dance, eg., they sing and dance Come on, be Happy on the way to his trial and a suspicion he will not avoid the gallows despite his supportive attorney's (Catherine Keener) belief in his deserving sympathy.

As a cultural allegory, this jukebox musical parallels our modern awareness of the multiple sides of any one personality, Jekyll and Hyde so to speak. It also points to the way we accept and foment inhumane tyranny in our political leaders, destructive riots, and mass shootings in ourselves. It is almost a given that society is ready at any moment to implode with its own mean affection for evil or crazies at least.

Joker: Folie a Deux is one of the best movie experiences this year my fav so far."

1.0,14 October 2024,"This really seems to be the sequel nobody asked for. If the first Joker movie was exceptional, and Joaquin's performance outstanding, the second part is exactly the opposite. Why in the world would somebody consider that a musical is suitable for a Joker sequel is beyond me. Lady Gaga is a great singer, no doubt about that, but her acting skills are poor. I wasted money and time hoping to see a beautiful movie. I was very dissapointed. The cinematography is good, but nothing extraordonary. In fact, in this movie, nothing in terms of screenplay, acting or cinematography justifies the insanely big budget spent by the studios. Would not recommend at all."
7.0,4 October 2024,"I'll cut to the chase. Unfortunately, this one misses the mark. While I can appreciate the experimentalism in terms of musical numbers and animation, it just isn't all that interesting. I get Joaquin Phoenix / Joker isn't gonna have this wonderfully soothing voice or anything, and the pain in his vocal expression combined with the lyrics is supposed to be the draw, but sad clown warbling just didn't do it for me. Gaga / Harley Quinn is spotlighted too, but it just felt like I was watching and listening to Gaga concert footage. The songs weren't original and the execution was overall underwhelming.

Too much of the movie is ""member this???"". It seemed like a meditation and homage to the first Joker more than it did its own thing for about half the film. The camera shots, the lines, all the memorable little 'moments' from the first movie were just rehashed and it made me wish I was watching *that* instead.

I could go on, but all else I'll say is, don't get your hopes up too high. Enjoyable enough fare for a night out, but not a must see in theatres. I saw ""Joker"" twice in the same week when it was first released. I doubt I will ever rewatch this one. Oh well."
4.0,1 October 2024,"The film bored me, the characters are well played but the story has a boring and uninvolving writing, watching the film I often yawned. If the film is boring for me it is a no-no, because a film has to engage and interest me, it has to entertain me, but this film bored me a lot. I liked the first ""Joker"" film much better, this is sequel I consider to be quite inferior, and the weak point of the film for me is that it does not engage the viewer at all, instead it makes him bored. In conclusion it is an inferior sequel to the first film in terms of writing and involvement, much inferior. The whole film is like this."
10.0,7 October 2024,"Despite all the negative reviews. I went into this movie open minded.

No, the movie isnt as good as the first one. But for me if you loved the first movie, Joker: Folie a Deux is still a great sequal.

Joaquin Phoenix isnt a great singer and Lady Gaga her songs didnt sound great either. In a movie thats about singing and dancing I dont really understand why they chose to make it a musical. Besides that the movie still hits you with stunning shots and a great story.

Its because of all the brainwashed idiots on TikTok people automatically think of it as a terrible movie.

Go into this movie open minded and think of it as a darker version of La La Land in the Batman universe and you will enjoy this sequal."
7.0,6 October 2024,"I for the life of me can't understand how a billion dollar movie studio greenlit the premise of this movie being a musical. The first one was a psychological thriller that was dark, gritty, and grounded in reality. This sequel is boring, there's very little story wise and very little to progress the character forward. Any time the movie begins to have a good scene with decent dialogue, the characters suddenly break out into song. This is done repeatedly over and over and it just stops any momentum the movie gets. The studio should have never allowed this movie to be a Broadway musical and the director should have objected to returning because this sequel tarnished his previous work."
3.0,7 October 2024,"The acting by Phoenix and Gaga is top tier. Whilst people currently dislike it due to it having an alternate musical genre people will realise the masterpiece that has been created using an alternate genre not following the same niche that has been the meta for the previous decade. The songs are perfectly spaced adding an enjoyable element to continue to register the audiences engagement throughout the film. Furthermore the movie offers and amazing deep dive into insanity and a split personality whilst offering an in depth and entertaining court room scene that offers the perfect mix of drama, comedy and suspense."
1.0,2 October 2024,"7.5/10 You either love it or you hate it, i didn't love it but i didn't hate it, i was in the middle but still on the positive side mostly because of Todd Phillips style of filmmaking, visually stunning, and incredible performances by all the cast, if you mind the slow burn 2 hours plus storytelling then there's a chance, but if you are not one of those who mind then stay off or go watch it when you can able to pause it, it was a lot of stuff in a movie that doesn't have a lot of stuff in it as it mostly takes during the aftermath of the first Joker which i think still a much superior film, i like it but i can felt the others when the movie does play the game a bit safer, less violence, more musical number, which in terms of the musicals specifically as it is the one aspect that people are concern, i'm a fan of musicals, and when it's really well choreograph and added with style, i personally really like it, i'm more disappointed at how those two things (the violence and the musical) didn't blend equally, besides that i enjoy most of the stuff, is there an unnecessary feeling for this movie serve as a sequel? Yes, but it's still a pretty good extended 2 hours and 18 minutes bonus content of what happen after the first movie in my opinion, and now we can send off the clown."
6.0,4 October 2024,"I seriously cannot believe they turned the follow-up to such an incredible and thought-provoking film into a cheesy musical. The tone is completely off compared to the original, and instead of building on the powerful story, they seem to have abandoned it entirely in favor of unnecessary singing.

There's practically no plot or depth, and they use every opportunity to break into song. It's a huge disappointment, especially after how great the first movie was.

I believe what could have been a powerful continuation of the story has been reduced to a movie you won't feel like watching again. Ever."
2.0,10 October 2024,"It started off badly, got worse in the middle and the less said about the end the better.

I've seen some reviews online saying that it's a brilliant film but just not everyone understands it. But the ""deeper message"" is actually very straight forward. The problem with this film is the plot line, which contains very little action and therefore the drama relies on the scripting, which was disappointingly poor and boring.

In terms of the musical aspect to the film, it's not like Grease or The Greatest Showman, however I would say this Joker is a musical. Not all of the songs felt out of place, however some were too much.

Overall, this film is a lame idea on physiological illness which isn't as clever as some believe, with little scripting or action to accompany it."
7.0,4 October 2024,Forget what other film critics are telling you .. yes this movie isn't like the first one .. but movie critics need to know that's it's not a sequel.. it's just a story.. that's it .. and it's entertaining.. this film is a love story .. not about crime or another batman series or a joker prequel or something.. it's just a pure love story between two psychopaths that's it.. and as the critics mentioned that ' what happened ' .. we'll I guess we should ask them them that 'wete you about to make a movie ? ' or ' were you about to act in a movie ?' or ' were you about to produce a movie? ' .. lol .. none of them will meet that criteria but still these 'so called critics' are calling this 'WTF Happened' ... Lol you happened.. you .. unemployed critics who couldn't make it .. you happened.. so guys don't listen to these unemployed people.. go watch this movie as a love story and not as any other genre movie.. and you'll love it .. thank you :)
1.0,4 October 2024,"The original Joker film was masterfully done, paving the way for a sequel. Joaquin Phoenix delivered an outstanding performance in the first Joker film. However, Joker 2 is a direct contrast to its predecessor.

The musical aspect is one of the worst parts, with the second being Lady Gaga's casting; her terrible performance made the film even worse. I recommend waiting till it is a cheaper rental or streaming. The musical part ruins the overall atmosphere of the film. This doesn't even feel like a Joker film; it just feels like a parody of a Joker film! This is undoubtedly one of the worst films of 2024."
7.0,5 October 2024,"The movie starts with a very random comic sketch written on Joker about him and his shadow and how it was his shadow all along who did all the crime and blamed it on him. The scene abruptly cuts to Arkham Asylum where Arthur Fleck is now on medication. He has no zeal to tell jokes anymore, maybe he gave up, or the medications were working on him.

Later in the movie, he meets another cellmate Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) and they started talking and he finds out how she is a big time joker supporter, and how she believes in him. Our movie starts with this one statement now, and the movie is all about how Arthur Fleck fights with his own reality.

Coming to the performance, Joaquin Phoenix did it again, absolutely brilliant with his Joker and Arthur Fleck both. This time, a lot of things happened in his mind, rather than in real life but in different way and thay brings out the madness of his character. Lady Gaga on the other hand, could not show her acting skills much because she was busy singing everywhere abruptly which was not at all required to be honest.

According to me, making it a musical was not at all a good decision, there was a lot of missed opportunities in the movie. When the story tries to grab you with the performance of the actors, somehow an abrupt song breaks the flow so even if the songs were beautifully written and sung, they were not at all required because they ruined the little left plot in the movie.

The songs somehow drags the movie down because there could have been gripping and chilling dialogues instead which would have made so much sense in those scenes. It was 'madness of two' and all you can see is one getting mad, in all those songs, that is the audience.

Overall, the ending will surprise you if you think about it in depth. The ending gives you the hint of the origin of the Joker we all know, we all love. In the end, the movie is not as bad as the people have told you, and not as good as you have thought it to be. It was a too flashy attempt to glorify an already successful movie and it went bad.

Having all that said and heard, I want to tell you to watch the movie and decide yourself, if that is the Joker you really deserved?"
2.0,3 October 2024,"Lady Gaga has been playing her own character for a very long time. Lady Gaga as a popstar is a character, everything about her is exxagerated, and it worked (or at least it did) quite well for that purpose. As an actress, it feels like everything she does has the same exxagerated tone. In House Of Gucci that exxageration already bothered me quite a lot, here it was no different. It's not necessarily bad, but it's not appropriate for all characters in all movies. Joaquin Phoenix is great, doing the best he can, but no miracle can save such a script and such a ""violent"" turn of tone when compared to the first movie. It was not needed, it was not fun, the music sequences as annoying because they seem to interrupt what's already slow paced, and the ending..."

1.0,6 October 2024,"The concept was very interesting and acting was top notch as expected. Before formulating your opinion based on other reviews and critics opinions just give it a try. It is almost a perfect movie afn explores Arthur's reasons to choose Joker persona. I was deeply touched by this work. This kind of original ideas should keep coming out of movie industry so it revives again. I am very disappointed with people who bash the movie because it is something else than they expected. This kind of close-minded attitude results in countless remakes, same marvel movies and no risk. I think when it wil be reviewed logically rather than emotionally in the future , this movie will be considered classic !"
1.0,11 October 2024,"Right off the bat - it's not the *best* movie but it really does close the chapter to Arthur's storyline. May not have been a great idea to make it a 1/3 musical (because it really is not a musical throughout the entire film), but it really adds some perspective to his psyche. Because all musical sequences were when he closed himself off from the outside world.

Ultimately I enjoyed the movie and feel it could have had a bit more chaos and chemistry between Harley and joker, but it is what is. Harleys character is just useless in this plot and even she wasn't in it it wouldn't have made much of a difference. Still the troubled mind of Arthur is what keeps this afloat and the idea of the joker that spreads across Arkham.

Overall - a watch for me, would watch it again sometime in the future."
6.0,2 October 2024,"Tod Phillips should've asked for some guidance on how to handle a musical within this world. I felt like Arthur/joker took a back seat and they did some flashbacks. Idk maybe focusing on Harvey Dent and other interesting characters within the DC universe, whoever they could've added or maybe mentioned within the joker universe at least it just didn't feel the same and as shocking as the first one I don't wanna give too much away at all so this isn't spoilers this is just very much my opinion I do not think Lady Gaga was necessary. I do not think a single was necessary. The first one was the best if they would've kept it at that I would've been able to keep it legacy, adding a sequel only devalued it. It's not that I don't appreciate God's voice or I'm not a fan. Maybe she should not have to sing in every movie like use your acting chops and just act girl you got it. You don't need to sing in every movie. We already know you're a great singer so stop please."
5.0,3 October 2024,"Waited ages for this part to come out. It's pathetic , should have warned it changed the title to - Joker-The musical.

The directors producers and writers should be ashamed ti turn this opportunity into a movie of their personal likeness of a damn Mucis show.

The story is no where near good and again they have tried to tell each sequence in a for of a song. I still have to go on for 212 characters so I'll just repeat what it's all about - WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL WE DID NOT WANT A MUSCIAL."
2.0,5 October 2024,"I was going to go and see the first Joaquin Phoenix outing as the ""Joker"" (2019) to remind my self of who did what to whom, but I didn't have time. I think I am glad because I recall that being so very much better than this. Here, we pick up after ""Fleck"" (Phoenix) has been on his clown-faced slaughtering spree and is in prison supervised by prison officer ""Jackie"" (Brendan Gleeson). His lawyer ""Maryanne"" (Catherine Keener) is trying to have him declared competent to stand trial for his crimes so she can plead some sort of personality disorder defence - he's not ""Fleck"" when he's the ""Joker"" sort of thing. Thing is, he encounters ""Lee"" (Lady Gaga) at a prison sing-a-long and she manages to ingratiate herself with him and then to derail that plan ensuring the plot twists it's way into the courtroom where his conviction for multiple homicides quickly appears as inevitable as there being a song in the film. Now I did like the soundtrack, but by the way Todd Phillips has presented this, it might as well have been either Tony Bennett or Newley who took on the leading role as her part is largely a series of entertainingly photographed music videos with the thinnest slices of meat constituting a weak story in between. It's a love story, I suppose, but that wasn't really what I turned up to see. There's loads of excess, but no menace or jeopardy and the character's previous adeptness at treading the thin line between sanity and madness isn't really developed at all here. He comes across more as a pathetic, emaciated, prisoner whose flame has well and truly gone out. His legal antagonist (Harry Lawtey) looks about eleven years old but that doesn't really matter either as the judicial proceedings themselves offer us little by way of sustaining drama, even as we build to a denouement that offers the tiniest bit of hope then... It's a stunning piece of cinema, money has been spent and there's imagination a-plenty from the production's designers. It's just too much of a jigsaw of a film with too little plot serving as a vehicle for an album boxed-set that's doubtless ready to hit the shops."

1.0,5 October 2024,
10.0,7 October 2024,"Despite all the painful-to-watch and cringeworthy singing moments, I believe what makes this film a complete disaster is Todd Phillips's failure to recognize that the Joker from the Batman series is not the character he wanted to portray. He aimed to create a film about a broken man finding his place in the world. While in the first film, many of us, at least myself, saw it as a ""set-up"" prologue, in this second installment, it is evident that it wasn't. The character he wanted to flesh out has nothing to do with the Joker from Batman. I would even argue that he played us all for fools, taking advantage of the huge following of the series to obtain the resources he desired.

However, this accusation is irrelevant, because what is truly aggravating is the fact that the Joker is supposed to be a kingpin-an insane mastermind who knows how to bend people to his will, even Batman. His insanity is not what makes him scary; it's how his genius conceals it, making the most unsound arguments seem reasonable. This is something that Nolan and Heath Ledger truly understood at its core.

I don't care if Todd Phillips wanted to do something different; he should have done it under a different name and not within Batman's universe. In my view, it is terribly disrespectful to those who were expecting a worthy origin story. He knew what he was doing; he wanted to tell the story of a victim-with zero eloquence, zero ambition, zero intelligence, and a dull persona. In Batman, he is anything but. That's why people are upset: ""you get what you deserve"" when you strip a character beyond recognition. Justice has been served by the audience, and honestly, I couldn't be happier for this to become a cautionary tale for anyone who wants to ignore the fact that Batman and the Joker became popular in the first place not because there weren't enough stories around."
6.0,9 October 2024,"Joker: Folie a Deux really doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Sure it has it's issues, but for the most part it is a very solid if slightly unnecessary sequel.

The biggest issue with this film is most definitely the story. It is painfully long considering it is devoid of any significant meaning or drive. I think it meanders far too much and doesn't add much to the first film. When it finally does get down to its point it is too rushed and as a result loses most of its impact. I was expecting a film bringing Harley and Joker together on screen in a grounded setting to lead to a more interesting story, and I think they missed a trick here.

What really can't be faulted with this film though are the performances of Phoenix and Gaga. This is no surprise as they are both brilliant, but the chemistry they share is also incredible. Everything they did with these characters from the design to the creative choices I thoroughly enjoyed.

Then there's the musical element. Perhaps people were unprepared for a musical? The patrons of the theatre I was in certainly were, as every song outbreak was greeted with audible signs and murmurs. Personally I thought this was one of the best parts! Lady Gaga singing? What's not to love. And the musical element just really works for these characters and the relationship they had and really complimented that well. A bold choice but one that really worked for me.

Aside from the lacklustre story I really don't understand the pile on for this film. Great characters and performances, inventive storytelling with the musical elements, and a good tone and vibe to the whole thing."
1.0,14 October 2024,"I'm not going to spoil the movie, but I feel really disappointed with it. Don't follow Disney's lead by inserting musical numbers-focus on the content instead. The movie's ending is quite disappointing; if it was an open ending, that would be fine, but why is it so lackluster? The lead actress sings well, but when it comes to music, we only see someone like Lady Gaga with her eccentricity in singing or on the red carpet. Lee Quinzel is far too dull. The male actor is good, but we only really see Arthur Fleck, not the Joker. If you're expecting Joker to appear so that more heroes can come later, please stay at home-you don't need to watch this."
3.0,7 October 2024,"I cannot express how disappointed I am with the general public for rating this movie so poorly, but I believe I understand why it suffers. Joker 2 is a complex and sophisticated film that does not hold the viewer's hand. There are parts of the movie where the audience is forced to make inferences and appreciate the development of extremely flawed characters and the average movie viewer is not interested in doing these things. There are also a number of scenes in which it is easy to assume to assume a mistake has occurred when it has not. We are so trained by the garbage movies that we are force fed to not put any trust in our films anymore. We see a scene in which things don't add up and we immediately think the writers have erred when in fact we just need to consider more deeply.

Spoilers ahead:

I believe most people don't even understand what this movie is about. They've gone to the theatre with the expectation of a redemption story where Joker busts out of the asylum with Harley and rides off into the sunset to commit the heinous crimes we know and love from the Batman movies, but that is not what this movie is. The entire film, on the contrary, is about Arthur NOT being the joker. The entire world wants him to be the joker (including you, the audience) and Arthur tries his best to be what we want him to be because he needs love and acceptance that the real Arthur has never received, but the fact is that he is not who we want him to be and he tells us as much. He is not smart, he is not charismatic, he is manipulated by Harley Quinn rather than manipulating her. It should come as no surprise when the movie ends and we discover that Arthur is murdered by the real joker, a detail of the film that a great many of the people watching didn't even pick up on despite the fact that Arthur's murderer cuts his own face into a smile after stabbing him.

Another common complaint is that the musical aspect of the movie was pointless. People say that the songs were random, often not fitting with the mood of the scene. THAT WAS THE POINT. The musical numbers are a representation of what is going on in Arthur's head. The music is jarring and incongruous with what is going on in the plot because Arthur is a nut case who lives in a fantasy world and the music serves to show us how his reality and actual reality are often the opposite of each other. Arthur fires his lawyer and decides to represent himself, almost certainly damning himself, but instead of feeling despair we get a song where he feels like the star of a show where Harley is his loving lady and all is how it should be.

I could go on for pages and pages about all the complaints I've seen about this film and how they are made from a place of ignorance, but I think it's more helpful to leave a piece of advice: Watch the Joker 2 with and open mind and full confidence that you are in good hands. Trust the film. There are no mistakes. There are no leaps in logic. If you are confused about a scene, stop and think and you may be able to appreciate what I consider to easily be the best film of the year."

5.0,6 October 2024,"Such a boring, uninteresting, desperately slow, not going to anywhere movie. It's been a long time i dont have this feeling after watching a movie, when a movie is just bad at least it keeps being bad and you expect it to be bad. After the first one, which i wouldn't say it's a masterpiece but its a really good and solid movie, you expect this to evolve and bring in more to the table, but man, this musical stuff during the whole movie, it stalls the movie completely, and even the main story with gaga and the joker is an absolute joke, bad written and pointless.

Also the Arthur plot is boring. I wouldn't recomend to watch this at the theaters, if you wanna watch wait for a stream, it felt like such a waste of time.

Even the adlips of the singing felt out of sync and not well done, too over compressed vocals, aside from overdoing the songs all the time... Whatever, I tried to go with an open mind but it was painful to watch from the half to the end."
6.0,13 October 2024,"I don't know what I just watched. Boring, pointless, and a waste of time. The progression of the film is terribly slow and unproductive. The acting no longer seems ""Joker"" - if you removed the title and added another random name to it, you'd think it was a story about some guy with anorexia who's in jail. The whole time I just saw Joaquin Phoenix, not the Joker. Then they added a musical element to it, which is a what-were-they-thinking moment. The second movie is supposed to ramp up the stakes. It should be more captivating, intense, suspenseful, and memorable, like the Dark Knight was. Instead, it felt like they peaked with the first and gave up on this one, like they accomplished everything they wanted with the first and now they're just lost with what to do or whether they should care. Here's another one to add to the long list of garbage DC movies. The only DC thing worth watching now is The Penguin."
1.0,3 October 2024,
7.0,5 October 2024,"Joker 2 is a massive disappointment when compared to the brilliance of the first film. The decision to turn what was initially a dark, psychological character study into a musical is baffling and completely undermines the tone that made the original so powerful. The musical numbers feel out of place and detract from the raw, gritty world that was built in Joker 1. What's even worse is that the spotlight shifts almost entirely from the Joker himself to Lady Gaga, making it feel less like a Joker movie and more like a Lady Gaga showcase.

In Joker 1, there was a subtle yet significant tie to the larger Batman universe, with references to Bruce Wayne and Gotham City that added depth and context to Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. However, Joker 2 abandons all of that, losing any connection to the broader world that could have made the story more meaningful. The film's narrative becomes so centered on Gaga's character that it might as well have been titled Lady Gaga, not Joker.

The only saving grace of this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as the Joker. His portrayal is once again mesmerizing, showing the tortured and chaotic nature of the character. But even Phoenix's brilliance can't save a film that feels disjointed, tonally confused, and lacking the substance that made the first one so iconic."
1.0,16 October 2024,"Story is maybe somewhere. I do not know. I found the fact there is a ""love story"" interesting. But it played out super boring. I gave up after watching for 35 minutes.

I went in watching it SERIOUSLY because Ben Shapiro dumped on it and was hoping that it was ""you and I see things differently"". He's dumped on other movies that I really liked.

This one? Holy moly guacamoly. Thought I was watching a scam film when it started as a cartoon. Pointless cartoon for the most part. And then it went pointless into his cell.

Gave up at that point the first time watching. Second time, I was gonna give it more and more time to win me over.

35 minutes later; this plot is junk. Maybe it will get interesting. But, nothing in these 35 minutes gives me any hope of anything interesting happening."

1.0,5 October 2024,"I'll start off by saying this - I'm a fan of comic book related movies. I'm not a superfan, I can't talk for hours about any iteration of The Joker, however I watched the first one when it came out and enjoyed it. I'm saying this because there's a solid chance that certain aspects completely went over my head and maybe someone who knows a lot about this world can find something in this movie that I haven't

This movie was flat out boring. I don't need constant action to entertain me, but this movie had virtually nothing. It was just a man in jail, a man in a courtroom, and a man on the streets. All that it really did was tell us about the first movie, which constantly reminded me of how much better it was.

When the credits rolled, I felt as if genuinely not a single second of that movie was enjoyable in the slightest and that I had completely and totally wasted my time. In fact, I'd argue that the ending is insulting to anyone who even moderately liked the first one simply because this whole movie accomplished absolutely nothing!

I can not overstate how much nothing is going on here. There is nothing of substance in the entire movie. I 110% suggest skipping out on this one."
1.0,3 October 2024,"There is a difference between pure art and pulp. People rating this movie under 8 clearly love pulp.

This movie and all together part one and two are art in its purest form. The acting (especially of Phoenix and Gaga) is on the highest and (again) so pure, poetic and perfectly ""intimite"". The story has so many layers that one has to watch in definitely more than once. The songs were meaningful and perfectly chosen. The jokes mixed with the real life drama was a home run. It's in my top 3 movies ever(!).

...and some people love easy pulp; they will not like this movie, but luckily for them there is Marvel; always delivering on the shallow note, repeating all tricks again and again."
7.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux doesn't follow the same pattern as the first movie, but it's still a very correct film. The musical sequences fit well, and while they're not as excessive as people claim, they add depth to the story. It's visually impressive, and the performances are strong, especially Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.

If you expect it to be just like the first, you might be disappointed, but if you go in with an open mind, it's clear that this is a different, yet solid film. Without the first movie to compare it to, the criticisms wouldn't be as harsh-it's simply a good film worth seeing in the cinema."
1.0,16 October 2024,"The real Joker will never make a musical like that. Horrible. The movie Joker is a musical, but why? This Joker would never fight Batman. This Joker is manipulated and weak. He doesn't think about escaping. He doesn't think about fighting. The most terrible part is that the police abuse him without showing any reaction. Harley Quinn just sings throughout the entire movie and has none of the personality from the other films released in recent years. Harley Quinn is a disaster. I wouldn't watch this movie again, and it should never have been released. What a way to ruin a character like Joker. Horrible movie."

7.0,5 October 2024,"It's not bad. I mean, it's not that bad. It's colorful and cinematic. But it just doesn't make sense and shouldn't exist. ""Joker 2"" feels like a collection of deleted scenes from the original ""Joker."" And the problem is that they were ""deleted"" because they don't add anything new or important to the movie. Perhaps that's why the plot seems (and actually is) so meaningless. Because it's not an actual movie. It's just more scenes of dancing, singing, smoking, and suffering Joker (now with Gaga). You've already seen similar scenes in the first movie (without Gaga though), which had a good plot and a story.

So, if you want to see more Joker, it might be better to simply rewatch the original movie. But watching ""Joker 2"" won't hurt you. It just doesn't make sense."
3.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a great movie! Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the Joker, and Lady Gaga is awesome too. This film is a musical, which gives it a cool twist, even if it's a bit dark. Some folks might say it's less dark than the first one, and I can see why. The first part really built up the Joker's character, but this time, it focuses more on Lady Gaga's character and how she connects with him.

This phase is super important for the Joker because it shows how he'll become more wild. By the end, you get a hint of how he'll really let loose in the next movie. The film talks about serious stuff like mental health and how people treat each other, and it does it well. Plus, the music and the way the city looks are really impressive.

I didn't see any big problems with the movie. It's strong and makes you think. Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is definitely a must-watch!"
10.0,6 October 2024,"Was never meant to happen and shouldn't of been made, a pure cash grab that seems ashamed of the first movie. Very choppy and seems to have musical numbers for the sake of it. By the end of the film we are left wondering, A. Who is the this man who stabs joker and just seems to only shown few times and then creates some mad timeline plot with Heath Ledger's Joker. Which itself is just beyond stupid to say the least. But also possibly to try and breed substance and attention to a film that tries that already with this musical obsessed sequel seemingly falling flat to most who have been disappointing to say the least. I myself looked forward to this all year and to watch that is just a mess to the mind."
7.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a bit challenging to watch. Polarizing in the sense the film lacks the punch of its predecessor. However, it does excel in certain aspects.

Set two years after the first film, the story follows Arthur, in a psychiatric ward and on trial. His life takes a turn after meeting Harleen Quinzel (Gaga), a fellow patient infatuated with his alter ego, Joker. Together, they spiral into a surreal, hallucinatory world, blending reality with vivid musical fantasies reminiscent of classic Hollywood musicals.

Despite the singing and dancing, the movie struggles to be an effective musical.

The story falls flat due to weak writing. The characters felt underdeveloped and the film's attempts at social commentary were kinda blunt, lacking the subtlety and depth that gave the first installment its emotional weight.

Despite its shortcomings, Folie à Deux is not without its merits.

Phoenix shines. Again. His performance is commendable; shows his incredible range and commitment to the character. Gaga was good and her singing was better. Their infusion in music sequences lends the film some quality, giving it the essence of a dark musical.

The background score was really good, added another layer of depth maintaining the class of the first film. Although the selection of the songs were not on point and pretty forgettable.

The background settings were satisfactory but could have offered greater variety, especially considering it is a musical.

Cinematography was superb. Lighting, bursts of smokes/mists pound you with rich hues of blue, red, teal, yellow etc. All the while immersing you in some dark musical spectacle.

Phillips has done well in directing a film that has great cinematography/visuals with splendid acting performances but could've given more in creating an engaging storyline. He has kept his standards though.

Joker: Folie à Deux certainly lacks the spark of the previous film. It ends up prioritizing style over substance. Musical film fans would wanna enter with mild expectations but joker fans would be happy to see their character in all its glory. Nevertheless, quality acting, stunning cinematography, decent direction and a solid background score, make the film worth watching."
1.0,19 October 2024,"A musical was off base for this movie and sequel genre. This was not enjoyable to watch. As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. The first Joker was really fun to watch and get into the movie through a perspective of the Joker and the psychological thriller aspect. However, even as a musical, this movie was not great, despite having the talented Lady Gaga. Making the sequel as a musical felt like very much the wrong decision, and it didn't really seem to take the story to a lot of places. Felt like a pointless trial and just threw in some music in there because they could. After seeing it, i couldn't help but feel like Todd Phillips made this movie as a ""screw you"" to sequels and studios, which seems like more of a screw you to all of the people who worked hard on this movie."
1.0,12 October 2024,"This is a really good film about Arthur Fleck and is exactly the sequal he should get.

Please do not listen to reviews saying it is boring and dumb, or no story. There is plenty of story and depth here, and a cruel joke. That is what Arthur Fleck is.

Arthur fleck was never going to take on the batman. It's about the madness he inspires, a sad man's act and mistake.

Watch it openly, understand that it is not a musical, but deluded couple, don't delude yourself out of seeing a very good movie.

This film took Arthur Fleck as far as he could go, and gives him meaning and purpose, it is not an insult or joke.

If you think so, the joke is on you."
6.0,2 October 2024,The movie was ruined by Gaga...she turned it into an awful musical and made it about her almost..Too much singing I Felt I was watching a musical and I almost fel asleep everytime Gaga sang. It was so boring and flooded with bad directing bad effects bad dialogue bad script. Almost no cinematography. Lady Gaga was awful and her influence on the movie made it some cringe musical just boring and ruined it. The ending really was bad and not thought out...it was just annoying and sleepy same time to watch. What a waste of time. Definitely will not recommend watching this..total waste of time. So boring and the ending was just lazy and bad and nonsensical.

6.0,9 October 2024,"The movie really pulls you in with great visuals, and those musical scenes? Yeah, some people aren't fans, but they actually make sense. Arthur even says, ""I don't want to sing anymore,"" which is funny because it feels like no one listens to him - just like the reviewers who miss the point. Those scenes show him happy for once, in love, so the music fits his mood perfectly. This film isn't really about the Joker anyway; it's more about the symbol he represents. Plus, age-wise, Arthur's too old to be Batman's Joker. For me, it beats the prequel by about 0.5 points - more layered, more interesting."

Do not let the critics and bad reviews dominate your thinking and take your own judging. I am looking forward for a joker 3 with more madness to come. I really want to see gaga and phoenix again and shine at the Oscar's like they deserve. Don't forget to laught tooooo!!!!!!"
1.0,2 October 2024,"I watched this movie joker that left me utterly disappointed, and I must say, it was one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever encountered. To anyone who is a fan of good movies, I urge you to avoid this film at all costs. From start to finish, it was a disaster in almost every possible way, leaving me thoroughly unimpressed and even frustrated by how poorly executed it was.

Let me begin by addressing the characterization of the joker, which, in my opinion, was one of the biggest letdowns of the entire movie. The film attempted to bring the joker character to life, but instead of capturing the essence of this iconic villain, the filmmakers turned him into a real joke, quite literally. The portrayal was so over-the-top, exaggerated, and lacking in depth that it became almost unbearable to watch. Rather than being the menacing, cunning, and psychologically complex character that fans of the genre are familiar with, the joker in this movie was reduced to a caricature. It was almost as if the filmmakers completely misunderstood the appeal of the character and decided to make a mockery of him instead.

But the problems didn't stop with just the characterization. The direction of the movie was equally appalling. I've seen bad direction before, but this one took it to a whole new level. There seemed to be no coherent vision, no clear narrative direction, and no sense of pacing. The scenes were disjointed and felt like they were thrown together without much thought or purpose. There was no flow, and at times, it felt like the movie didn't know where it was going. Transitions between scenes were jarring, and instead of building tension or suspense, the film stumbled from one poorly executed scene to another, leaving the audience confused and disengaged.

The acting was another major issue. It's hard to believe that talented actors were involved in this project because the performances were utterly lackluster. It felt as though the actors themselves didn't believe in the script or their characters. There was no emotional depth, no connection between the characters, and no chemistry that could have salvaged the weak plot. The lines were delivered in a way that was either too flat or overly dramatic, making it hard to take the movie seriously. It's rare to find a film where almost every performance feels phoned in, but this was one of those rare cases.

The movie's beginning was another sore point. Right from the first scene, it became apparent that the film was going to be a tough watch. The start was abrupt, poorly written, and did nothing to establish the world or the characters. There was no build-up, no intrigue, and no reason to care about what was happening. It felt as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to jump straight into the action without setting up any meaningful context. This lack of a solid foundation made it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the outcome.

The ending was no better. After enduring two hours of bad direction, acting, and storytelling, the film concluded with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It was rushed, unsatisfying, and left more questions than answers. Rather than providing a resolution or tying up any loose ends, the movie just abruptly ended, leaving the audience in a state of disbelief. It was as if the filmmakers simply gave up on trying to create a coherent ending and decided to stop the movie without offering any closure.

To top it all off, the dialogues in the film were atrocious. The lines were poorly written, often cringe-worthy, and lacked any sense of wit, intelligence, or emotional weight. The dialogue was so bad that it became unintentionally funny at times, which only further detracted from the movie's already weak attempt at serious storytelling.

In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone who values their time and enjoys good cinema to skip this movie altogether. It's not worth watching, even out of curiosity."
10.0,12 October 2024,I don't think this movie is as bad as everyone is saying. That being said the first one is way better. The acting in from Joaquin Phoenix is amazing. Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was surprisingly good. I didn't mind the musical notes of the movie. My main problem with the musical notes is that some of them seemed kinda cheesy. The story wasn't bad either. I think most people would say the musical aspect of it was it caused this movie to bombed. Cinematography was great just like the last one. I will give DC credit for being creative but it just didn't work for me in some aspects. I don't think it was boring like some people are saying. I was entertained the whole time. It's unfortunate this bombed and that we are not getting a third one because this could have been a great franchise.
6.0,6 October 2024,"I wonder what the insurance was like on this film since every...single...scene contained at least one person smoking. Chances are, they had to do multiple takes with each performer smoking a pack and a half to nail the scene...

This felt like an obligation movie. Like Writer/Director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix were contractedly (and very begrudgingly) HAD to do a follow-up to their Oscar-winning/billion-dollar original. ""Fine, since you're gonna make us do this, let's ruin it by making it a musical"" I could hear them say.

Also, this felt like it could work either way. It could be brilliant by making the sequel into a musical or the musical scenes could bring down the whole movie. Spoiler: it's the latter.

I could see maybe ONE fantasy scene play out with a song and dance on an obvious soundstage. Maybe two. Most of the movie, it didn't work. And neither did their voices.

I love Lady Gaga and her music. Not this time. She was awful. And maybe Phoenix isn't a born singer. I almost want to give him the benefit of the doubt since again, it felt like he was trying to sabotage the film. He was even worse with his voice.

What did work for me was the transition from depressed clown to slowly getting a smile on his face due to the introduction of Gaga's Harley Quinn. I pretty much loved watching that spark grow. While this was nowhere at all entertaining as the entirety of the first movie, at least that was something to grasp onto during this disaster.

Can't wait to hear someone ask if you needed to see the 2019's Joker. Well, you should anyways because that was 10x better. But, necessary? Not sure. They bring that movie up and its events as much as you see someone light up a cigarette. Again, that's every scene.

So, if you were to take away the musical segments, the smoking and the references to Part One, this would be 22 minutes, max. What would be left is those awesome character developing scenes of Joker getting life back into his chuckles.

It's easy to hate on this movie for making the daring, albeit terrible, choice of switching subgenres and making this a musical out of nowhere. If the songs were good, memorable or were sung well, I could easily forgive this decision. I left the theatre roughly 60 minutes ago and I can remember one line from one of the songs: I am that Joker, or something like that. Okay, I guess all songs/segments were pretty forgettable.

I definitely praised Phoenix for his take on the Joker in #1. While he was still only my third favorite live-action take (Heath Ledger will remain my #1 and Jack Nicholson's a solid second place,) Gaga's Harley Quinn was meh. I will ALWAYS prefer Margot Robbie's version. I understand this version and that doesn't make it great.

Was this a waste of time? Did I try and cancel my tickets all week? Is this a worthy follow-up to that fantastic first movie?

Why yes, yes and no. Skip it.

***

Final Thoughts: I will give this movie's opening a total thumbs up. I'm not sure why THAT wasn't the whole movie. I mean, if they could ruin the first by making this a bad musical, they could've certainly go all-in with that very fun opening."
1.0,4 October 2024,"The original Joker was one of those incredibly memorable movies due to its' compelling protagonist and premise. It was a movie that made you empathize with the main character and his plight, and continued to so even after things took a dark turn. Joker 2 is no exception in this regard, and feels like an organic continuation to the original film in almost every way.

The movie once again follows Phoneix's Arthur Fleck, 5 years after the events of the first, now an inmate on the island prison of Arkham. Despite previously attaining temporary psychological relief and catharsis through his brash criminal actions, he once again finds himself at the mercy of an abusive system and individuals who continuously dehumanize and wear on his psyche. Where the movie differs greatly from the first one are in the introduction of a deuteragonist, Lady Gaga's Lee (Harleen Quinzel), as well as the inclusion of musical numbers interjected throughout various points.

I don't want to spoil anything about the movie whatsoever, but I will make a few observations as to why I think that this is a perfect sequel. Firstly, it's the fact that director Todd Phillips managed to maintain the exact tone of the first film, as well as reprise and expand on its' themes of mental illness, cruelty, isolation, despair, the inefectiveness of social programs and institutions, and the publics unrelenting desire for sensationalism. Second, it's the execution of the musical numbers, which varied from raw and unvarnished cries from the soul to more traditonal performances that perfectly mimicked and portrayed the emotions and predicaments of the characters. Lastly, it's that the movie does a great job of keeping you in suspense at what will happen next, and let me just say that events that unfold do so at a measured pace that result in an apt finale, especially given the high pedigree of the first film.

I could write a lot more, but I would reccomend that you give it a watch keepping in mind some of the things that I've pointed out. For me personally, it was an experience more spellbinding and impactful than the first. 10/10."
1.0,11 October 2024,"JOKER : FOLIE 'A DEUX (2024) ** Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Zazie Beetz, Steve Coogan, Harry Lawtey, Leigh Ill, Bill Smitrovich. Filmmaker Todd Phillips' ambitious sequel to his hit reimagining of the DC arch villain is largely hit/miss in spite of Phoenix reprising his Oscar-winning role as Arthur Fleck whose imprisonment for several murders in the aftermath of the original has him set for his day in court while romancing fellow screw-loose fangirl Lee Quinzel (aka Harley Quinn - played with a determined Gaga). While its an interesting choice to have musical numbers (largely fantasy based within the characters' minds) and the gusto of its leads the film is an event in patience limits for its core audience particularly in its final act. Filmed in IMAX smartly using its practical f/x & locales (largely shot in my home state of NJ; YW) the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and Hilduer Guonadottir's sturm and drang score are well produced for its initial environs thru out."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I wish he hadn't continued the movie. I've seen very few movies worse.

I left the movie unfortunately, it is a wasted movie with actors.

You have Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga and is this really the movie you made? Is this the Harley Quinn created for Gaga? How can you not use a psycho type like Lady Gaga? How can you waste the director of photography and the set organization? I feel sad and angry as if I watched the last season of Game of Thrones.

The first movie of Joker was not great, yes, but the second series did not deserve it either. The nonsense called musical goes to love movies (in fact, it does not go to that either, this category should be deleted from the history of movies anyway) The constant singing of songs like Bollywood is annoying and disrupts concentration. Even if it was not a musical, the script is already terrible from top to bottom. I am not even talking about the ending. This disgraceful script is a complete insult to the audience next to such good acting. It is as if Todd Philips could not curse everyone and made such a movie.

Oh Lady Gaga, what should we say about your choosing these movies with non-flowing scripts? A star is born, house of gucci and now this movie.. they were all boring. The only plus of a star is born was that you made great songs. Your best work was ahs hotel. I wish you could use your psychotic side in todd philips but that's it unfortunately.

It wasn't really bad but it didn't work."
1.0,8 October 2024,"... as one online critic described it). Grim. Awful. This movie was so bad I might never watch any movie again. Like how you might swear off seafood after getting food poisoning or might refuse to fly again after barely surviving a plane crash.

The worst part is that I love the entire cast and the movie might have been slightly redeemed with a satisfactory end. Instead, it plowed right off the cliff of cinematic dispair with me strapped into the passenger seat wondering what atrocity I'd inflicted on the world that my karma would subject me to this.

Todd Phillips and Scott Silver should be tried for crimes against humanity for their part in torturing innocent unsuspecting moviegoers with this theatrical abomination."
6.0,5 October 2024,"This movie isn't as bad as many people are saying. Phoenix is terrific in his reprisal of Arthur Fleck. Lady Gaga's Harley is suitable as his love interest, and the musical numbers are poignant and well made.

The film is something we don't get very often...it's art. It almost reminds me of the old 60's Batman episode where Joker paints a blank canvass and calls it art and wins a contest - it's just...art. The movie is art.

The film completely flips the superhero/supervillain genre script on its head and commits to being a Broadway musical as Fleck deals with the repercussions of his actions in the first film and the madness of the forces battling inside of him and in the world around him. Who saw that coming?

The third act of his movie could have been stronger and I would have rather set up a third Joker film - but I liked the way this movie took risks and committed to them and made something the world has never seen before."
1.0,3 October 2024,"Ugh, what a complete waste of my precious time! I walked into Joker 2 expecting some semblance of entertainment, but what I got was a mind-numbing, cringeworthy experience that left me questioning the sanity of the filmmakers.

The acting was atrocious, the plot was convoluted and nonsensical, and the dialogue was cringe-inducing. I swear, I've seen high school students write better scripts for their drama club productions. The movie tried to be edgy and provocative but ended up being a laughable mess (pun intended).

The cinematography was the only slightly redeeming quality, but even that was overshadowed by the sheer idiocy of the storyline. I checked my watch every 10 minutes, willing the movie to just be over already.

Overall, I'd give Joker 2 a solid 0/10. Don't waste your money or your time on this trainwreck. Trust me, you won't be laughing - you'll be crying tears of frustration and disappointment."""
6.0,5 October 2024,"I honestly Really enjoyed about 70% of the movie. How the Joker was having some sort of internal crisis which only was shown in the court room were all his aura was shown, also i thought it was a interesting take to make it a musical which did add to it in a way but sadly didn't really wow me. It was just the ending to me and the closing actions which really started to bore me purely because the ending was so rushed. Now thinking about it, that was enjoyable but i wouldn't reccomened because either you're just gonna be bored of the court room or not gonna like the ending which ruins the taste of the whole movie."
1.0,3 October 2024,"This movie has nothing in common with the brilliant first part.

I was skeptical from the moment it was announced that Folie à deux would contain musical elements. Nevertheless, I was optimistic that the great cast would somehow pull it off .

They didn't.

This movie lacks any plot. There are several flashbacks that remind you of the great first part but nothing more happens. The musical-scenes don't make sense imo. There were actually quite some dialogues I was interested in, but every time it felt like now something is finally happening another song started, destroying any suspense.

The whole time it felt more like watching an epilogue than an actual sequel.

In the end I actually regret watching this movie and after almost 138 min I was just glad that it was over."
8.0,8 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux Non-Spoiler Review Rate: 6.2/10

Let's make one thing really clear. The movie wasn't that bad; in fact it wasn't bad at all. IT WAS THE ENDING!!! The ending, wow, it's awful. Honestly I don't know how to feel, but the ending ruined the movie for me and sort of the first movie as well.

However... the movie (taking away the ending) was decent! The acting and performance was well done. The musical scenes were really good! And the cinematography was fantastic. As for the writing itself, it was good - well until the ending happened.

Overall, the film is good BUT NOT THE ENDING!!!"
6.0,3 October 2024,"*Joker: Folie à Deux* had high expectations to meet following the success of the first film, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver strong performances, the movie struggles to capture the same intensity and originality that made the first *Joker* a standout.

One of the main criticisms is that the sequel feels unnecessary and lacks the gripping narrative of its predecessor. The film is described as a ""dreary, underwhelming, unnecessary slog with much of the story set in Gotham's Arkham Asylum and a courtroom, which fails to engage the audience as effectively as the chaotic streets of Gotham did in the first film.

The decision to incorporate musical elements, while ambitious, does not pay off. Critics have noted that the musical numbers, although showcasing Lady Gaga's vocal talents, feel out of place and disrupt the film's tone The courtroom drama aspect is also seen as a misstep, making the movie feel more like a drawn-out legal debate rather than a thrilling psychological exploration

Additionally, the sequel lacks the same social commentary and emotional depth that resonated with audiences in the first film. While *Joker* was praised for its raw portrayal of mental illness and societal neglect, *Folie à Deux* seems to miss the mark, offering a less impactful and more superficial narrative

In summary, *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a letdown compared to the original. Despite strong performances from its lead actors, the film's disjointed narrative, misplaced musical elements, and lack of compelling storytelling make it a sequel that many fans might find disappointing."
1.0,3 October 2024,"The first movie became a phenomenon that actually turned people into Joker style vigilantes. Obviously the producers didn't want this to happen again and were probably told not to allow it. However the new movie keeps the strange ambience of the original in many other ways.

My fears about Lady Gaga wrecking the plot were groundless. Our beloved incel Arthur Fleck remained, almost, entirely intact, as it were.

The notable complete absence of Batman shines a black light on the producers concern about creating a fictionalised Joker who actually escapes out of the screen into the minds and hearts of the oppressed masses. That is, if there's no Batman, the Joker is not the Joker but a literally dangerous icon that appeals to current alleged disenfranchised actual street people.

The film's use of a ""horror musical"" is truly groundbreaking and utterly inspired. Hence Lady Gaga's presence as a kind of bent ""Christine"" to Phoenix's ""Phantom of the Opera"", but with excruciating horrible twisted romance tunes. The Phantom after all was also a killer.

The bleak darkness of the storyline follows many shadowy but fascinating sub-plots about love, romance, mental illness and the human mind itself.

Arthur Fleck, movie character, is way too dangerous to face any actual Batman because he has lots and lots of clones in reality who share the ""folie a deux"": an actual term in psychology defining the sharing of an illusion between two or more people. On a mass scale this is mass hysteria or mass hypnosis, something the producers manufactured by accident in the first film, and went to great lengths not to recreate."

6.0,1 October 2024,"Mainstream perceived first movie for some stupid reason as this politically dangerous subversive thing so here comes the sequel to set things straight. That is entire point of this movie almost like an attempt to apologize to Hollywood. It's obvious that actually very tame sub context of the first movie was an accident. I really did not see anything specially pointing middle finger to the establishment in the first one, it was actually really vanilla. There are way more important and stronger points you could make in a movie to say FU to ""modern"" society and attack its ""values"". It's scary that powers that be consider even a hint of subversiveness unacceptable, so you have to force correct in retrospect. Entire movie is just one big retcon, and original did not need a sequel. If you liked it, stay out of this one."
1.0,8 October 2024,"We all know the real reason this film was made. The fans of the original liked it for all the wrong reasons and the director decided to punish us for it. It's almost as if the director hates his audience. I wonder why, is it a racial hatred? Is it an ideological hatred? Why else would the director completely crush the hearts of the men who grew to identify with this character? Why else would the director destroy a beloved character the way he did in this film? I believe it is racial and ideological hatred that drove the director to force humiliate the fans he brought in with the original. Shameful and disgusting. Disrespectful to not only the fans but the actors. This movie is a hate crime, and it doesn't take much thought to realize why it was written and for who. If only you knew how much they hate you."

I'm not going to spoil the movie, but they took a really good, dark movie and turned it into an F'n musical! I can't stand musicals and had to walk out after 45mins of giving it a try. Thankfully I got a full refund from the theater. It's as if someone said, well we didn't mean for them to love the first one so much, how can we make the fans hate the villain.

The pacing is agonizingly slow, and the plot seems to wander aimlessly, lacking the depth and intrigue that made the first film compelling.

The performances, while occasionally compelling, are overshadowed by a script that seems to revel in its own pretentiousness. Instead of building on the original's brilliance, it dives into a chaotic narrative that left me more confused than entertained. I found myself checking my watch repeatedly, hoping for something-anything-to spark my interest.

After 40 minutes, I couldn't take it anymore and walked out. It's a shame, because I had high hopes, but Joker 2 turned out to be an exhausting slog that felt like an endless descent into despair without any of the artistry or insight that the first film delivered.

It's so confusing to me how anyone calling themselves a fan of either the Joker or Batman could ever like this trash... I didn't think it could be done but it's actually worse than the first one.

1.0,6 October 2024,"I appreciate the vision, but it fell short of greatness that its predecessor did. The movie had a lot of elements that I enjoyed such as some of the stronger, more theatrical musical numbers and thematic worldbuilding consistency between the two movies. I also enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously and was not just a traditional sequel to Joker.

But they also sprinkled in some numbers that felt jarringly weak in comparison to everything else. You can't just awkwardly film Phoenix singing poorly and justify it being in a musical. It felt like they didn't know how to actually make a musical at times. Quality over quantity should've been the idea when it came to the songs.

Also the ending was a giant middle finger. I'm not saying movies have to have the expected or happy ending - it's more interesting if they don't. But it felt like they didn't give care and just wanted to be contrarian. There was no intention to do anything meaningful with the relationship with Arthur and Harley."

It's as strong a sequel as I could have expected. The musical numbers all worked for me. The performances were all good. The movie looks great. However, ""Joker: Folie a Deux"" does run out of steam a bit during the last half hour or so. The movie ends up being about fifteen minutes too long.

Joker 2 focuses on Arthur's verdict following his murders & simultaneously a girl who follows him later turns an obsession towards him & how relationship works between them is being focused.

But the disappointment for me , in the name of ""musical psychological ""type, over dosage use of songs was literally a pain in the ass.

If the prequel conveys how the society treats a weak mentally ill person & what he gives back to the society, although movie runs at a slow pace, it was interesting to watch but coming to its sequel what it tries to convey is still a big question.

Joker 2 running time could have been to 1 hour maximum & should have been released over an OTT platform as it would get an opportunity for the viewer to pause when require as the extreme slow pace of the movie followed by over dosage of songs turned to be pathetic watching experience.

Except the Joaquin Phoenix performance, JOKER 2 is a total pain in the ass."
7.0,18 October 2024,"I think it's sad when people don't understand film. This picture deserves a fair rate, appreciate it for what it is and see the art within. Sure, the first movie is better, but this is a solid sequel. The effort and dedication Joaquin Phoenix puts in the role of Arthur Fleck, the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and the music by award academy winner, Hildur Guðnadóttir is an artwork by it self. It's not an Oscars film, but it's a good sequel by director Todd Phillip's. To give this movie a 5 of 10 is a joke! I gave it a 7, i would give it a 7.5 if i could. They say it's not an storyline, but it is!"
1.0,1 October 2024,"Multiple times during the screening I said to myself: ""Warner Brothers has done it again; they've destroyed another DC franchise."" I was reminded of Gaga's other questionable acting gigs, such as her disastrous Simpson's appearance. But, the more I watched, the more I wondered if the film before me was actually a piece of art so layered, dense and inspired that it transcended the bounds of human comprehension. Or, perhaps, could it be both? Are we mortals too feeble-minded to see the genius behind this film. Was the director inspired by the divine in a way that we will only come to understand in generations.

No, I think, perhaps it was truly just ... bad. A bad movie, prone to making decisions so obviously cringeworthy at every corner and also, inconceivably, also being a musical, because that's what DC needed: a sing-along adaptation of its once beloved villain.

I for one am going to home and turning HBO Max to watch a much better, animated, take on Harley Quinn."
1.0,14 October 2024,"Did I see a different movie than everyone else?

Most people seem to be saying that Joker: Folie à Deux is a dumpster fire of a disaster that hates its own fans. It's not a stretch to say this might be the most disappointing comic book movie of all time for a lot of people.

But for me... while I am still not 100% sure how I feel about it, I definitely don't agree with the majority. I really appreciated this film.

Joker: Folie à Deux (or Joker 2 as I will refer to it) is bold, unafraid, and complex, delivering a commentary on the sensationalism of trauma and mental health over the actual care for it. This is a film that swings for the stars in its execution, and while it doesn't always work, this is a film that will be talked about for years to come. While the initial backlash to the film is strong now, I feel after some time, people will begin to revisit this movie and re-evaluate it with adjusted expectations. Because frankly, Todd Phillips took most people's expectations of a sequel to the first Joker film and absolutely threw those out the window, giving all of us the middle finger for wanting that in the first place. The film is completely disinterested, and is actively hostile towards fulfilling your expectations, and then seems to chastise you for wanting to see a film about the Joker.

And goddamn it, even if the end result is a mess, I love that he had the courage to do this. I can't think of another major studio film with a $200 million budget in the last 10 years that actually had the guts to make something that wasn't just pandering to the fans - instead this film offers a subversive deconstruction of the character and in a meta-sense, the first film, that challenges our preconceived notions of what this movie would be. From a business perspective, this was a terrible idea, as we can see the results - a failing box office, theatres are empty, there's a disappointed fan base, and the film will ultimately lose money. But from an artistic perspective, like it or hate it, we are so lucky to have a film like this. I so appreciate the boldness of this film - I would rather see movies like this that take risks and swing for the fences (even if they don't always connect) than 100 of the same movies I see again and again. It starts an interesting dialogue over what has become the norm for tentpole films. I just love that Todd Phillips went for it."
6.0,4 October 2024,"After seeing the superb 2019 Joker film I had high hopes for this one. Especially once I started watching it since it began well. I enjoyed the story. The acting from both Phoenix and Lady Gaga was good.

I was previously aware that the movie was more or less a musical. I'm not a fan of musicals but I thought that using that to give the audience a sense of Arthur Fleck's confused state of mind fit. And it did work - to a point. However it was overdone to the point where it overshadowed the overall story. It reached the point where the continued musical numbers became tedious and boring. By the time the film reached it's conclusion I was no longer riveted like I had been earlier. I was pretty much bored and waiting for it to be done with.

Story-wise, I felt that everything about it made sense. I just got the sense that the story wasn't told well. I'm no expert on movie-making but I just felt that it missed the mark. And the ending, while again seemed to make sense, just seemed to be done poorly."
1.0,13 October 2024,"After all of the hype for Joker 2, it may be one of the biggest letdowns in cinema history. It's a 2 hour musical with cut scenes of court rooms and psych hospitals. Minimal action at best and a dragging storyline. Much more was expected out of Lady Gaga playing Harley Quinn but another letdown as well. After watching the first Joker multiple times, Joker 2 is a 1 watch movie, and it would be considered 1 time too many. The movie is very drawn out, you're expecting something awesome to happen and it just never does. The acting is not terrible but the general flow of the movie is horrible. This is a sequel that did not need to be made."
6.0,4 October 2024,
3.0,15 October 2024,"Thankfully I've watched this film without reading before any comment/review.

From the reviews here in IMDb, it is quite clear people have just huge prejudices for musical scenes. Not a great fan of musicals myself, but Folie a Deux includes these parts in a clever way, to properly depict Arthur Fleck's mental state: considering the sadness and depression of the main story, the contrast with cabaret-style scenes can only amplify and enrich the darkness of plot, obviously if you are open to see the whole picture without hating musical regardless of its delivery. So, I liked how musical scenes were used, maybe there are a couple of them not strictly necessary, but I disagree with people complaining ""too much music, too few madness"", they simply didn't try to understand the film.

Other pain point to take in account: plot development. Again, people had clearly some expectations, maybe they wanted a copy and paste of the previous film; thankfully it is not, otherwise it would be boring. Or maybe ""fan"" expected a remake of The Dark Knight, or an adaptation of The Killing Joke. But Todd Phillips' Joker was never any of these, because is not about madness, but mental sickness. Folie a Deux simply takes one of the possible paths that could branches out from Joker. And Phillips didn't choose the easy path, but the complex one, and I cannot be more grateful to him, giving us a different point of view. On the other side, since this is a sequel, it is strictly necessary to have (lately) watched the previous film, otherwise the development of Folie a Deux screenplay cannot be fully enjoyed. And in my opinion, when a film doesn't live in its own, is a negative point to consider.

About acting, main actors did a great job: Phoenix, Gaga, Gleeson performed well, and Keener was superb. Special mention to Beetz and most importantly Gill: even with reduced screen time, their part are the turning point of the whole film and their delivery was perfect. Unfortunately, all other actors' performances were below the average if not awfully bad, such as most of the extras, which overacting was out of tune and ruined several scenes.

From technical perspective - cinematography, set design, photography, almost everything is good. Only negative part is montage: there are some cuts and scene transition which I found confusing and too rushed.

In conclusion, title of my review says it all: it is a good film (not a masterpiece, but neither Joker was) that has the courage to follow author's idea and not fandom demands, and cinema lovers need more than ever film like this. I hope from now on producers will remember that not all films must be a product to please the ""fans"", but can be an authorial work. After all, cinema is art.

PS: For all the ""fandom"" people, please continue to watch MCU, DCU, endless sagas of films all clones of themselves, but please do not talk about films you can't or don't want understand.

For all the people who just want to enjoy cinema, never read comments or reviews before watching a film."
7.0,4 October 2024,"This whole movie is such a let down from the first joker as the original film was a dark gritty and thrilling experience while this film is an utter disappointment .

The Story of this film is ok but Joker spending mostly the whole film in a courtroom trying to be proven non guilty . Is a joke I was expecting to go and see joker in long action scenes with Harley Quinn

The Acting of joaquin phoenix and Lady Gaga was probably the only good thing about this movie .

Anytime this movie built up to a intense scene or interesting scene they just sang to just show there feeling which in my opinion is terrible as we didn't see what would happen without the music .

Whoever decided to make this film a 'musical' Is a idiot and I'm sorry for saying this but waiting five years for a thrilling sequel was such a let down .

All in all I will not be revisiting this film as it was so bad due to the music .

Me as a viewer who bought tickets to see the film the first day it released is not happy !!!"
1.0,5 October 2024,"That was my reaction we I saw the ending of the movie.

Joaquín as always, he puts on an incredible performance. The visuals and the cinematography in the film was great. Lady Gaga was okay in the film. The tone and the atmosphere in the film was the same as the first.

Making the moving musical made sense to me because of how Arthur Fleck interacted with music and how he imagine stuff in the first movie, in the stairs scene or the show scene. Also there is some perspective in the society side is that Joker now is the entertainer and the hero to them so that's why Arthur was imagining himself as an entertainer. The music choice was great and it wasn't too much or little it was perfect.

Todd Phillips should've wrote the Harley's story more we didn't see why she want to be with the joker. The writing didn't gave Gaga an opportunity or justice to deliver a good performance during the film. The idea of she doesn't want to be with the Joker because Arthur doesn't want to be the Joker anymore is brilliant but the delivery was so bad and rushed. That shows that Harley loves the joker not Arthur.

The trial scene was great and one of the best in modern cinema and again Joaquin did an outstanding performance.

Another thing in the movie is that they don't show us more of the Arthur they only show us little bet of what his mom thinks of him but I felt I wanted more. The movie felt like it doesn't have that core but there is some messages and meanings but it lacked the core.

The ending was one of the worst ending ever I have ever seen because the ending was missing a conclusion I mean poor Arthur what he has done to deserve bad writing from Todd like that. At the end watching that ending made me saying that we didn't need a sequel in the first place I give the movie between 6 to 7."
10.0,8 October 2024,"I spent a total of $72 for tickets and munchies for this film. With covid putting a damper on the film industry, you would think writers would have had enough time to come up with a hit. Joker 1 was ok. This, was absolutely horrible. Who and why would they take something that has potential and make it a musical? And for Joaquin agreeing to this, surprised me. He's a great actor and for him to even do a film like this, sad. At no point or warning prior to buying tickets, we're we warned that this is a musical. It's 2024, please return to the writing room and do better for 2025 and so on. Flop!!"

1.0,1 October 2024,"I attended an advanced screening of Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) this evening. The storyline follows Arthur Fleck after the events of the first film, framed as a sort of prison drama. He is set to be reevaluated for his crimes and must return to court. In order to defend himself, he must convince the world that there are two versions of him: Arthur Fleck and The Joker. As he prepares for his trial, he meets a woman who changes his life forever-but will she help his case, or send him spiraling in an entirely new direction?

Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover), the film stars Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line), Lady Gaga (A Star is Born), Catherine Keener (Capote), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), Steve Coogan (The Other Guys),!and Harry Lawtey (The Pale Blue Eye).

I could watch a million of these Joker movies. Joaquin Phoenix is a national treasure, once again delivering an iconic performance of a man battling his inner demons-except now, love is the new demon in his life. His seamless transformation from The Joker to Arthur Fleck and back is a masterclass in acting. The entire cast delivers tremendous performances, and every scene Phoenix shares with Lady Gaga and Brendan Gleeson is masterfully crafted. Their dialogue, mannerisms, and chemistry are pitch-perfect for the story.

The filmmaking here is top-notch, with stunning cinematography, lighting, and camera work. While some of the musical numbers were hit or miss, certain songs were perfect for fans who understand the Joker's inner turmoil. One song in particular, ""The Joker Is Me,"" is an absolute standout-a 10/10 moment that resonates deeply with the audience. There's also a courtroom scene featuring ""Mr. Puddles"" that's cinematic gold. The writing is sharp, with lines like ""no more singing"" serving as a clever relationship metaphor. The ending is completely unexpected, making the film even more enjoyable.

In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux isn't quite as good as the first film, but it stands on its own as a unique, compelling piece of cinema. I'd score it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it."
6.0,2 October 2024,"Movie- JOKER : FOLIE À DEUX (FDFS)

This sequel of cult masterpiece movie released in 2019 which Joaquin Phoenix is present as JOKER and he conquered the role. Now, his sequel is released reprising the role of Joker aka Joaquin Phoenix and newly added his love interest Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga himself. I come straight to the point , i didn't find this sequel better than the original or came close to it. This is morely about a trail with the musical essence which was filled to the top. However, it is not bad i would say. I was expecting something else and they give us something else which is not settle in my vision. Although, the music was good , the direction was supremely good, but the writer fell short in the storyline i think i was a good plot about the trail and all but it will be sweet if it's done and sorted till the interval not stretched to the climax. As it is a musical one , it was beautifully executed. If i talked about the performance, they both preachingly delivers so good man. I have no doubt about Joaquin but Lady Gaga is so good performer too. Exceptional. As its starts you will fall into their world of joker. Simply outstanding. But came up short with the plot and the elements. Not a masterpiece like the Joker (2019) but a decent one.

One Time Watch. Recommended."
4.0,5 October 2024,"What a waste of time. I wish I could give less stars than this.

I haven't seen such a bad movie before, trust me.

I was so excited to watch this movie, but this movie has no storyline and it is basically a MUSICAL, and that too a bad one.

The acting was fine but at least if they had to make a musical, they should have clearly mentioned it in the genre and would've saved a lot of people's time.

It got bad with every passing minute and when you thought they are done w the songs, they are not.

Even in the end, the main character ""Arthur Fleck"" says, he can't sing anymore ( exactly like how we felt, we can't listen anymore )."

7.0,3 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux falls disappointingly short of its predecessor. Instead of building on the intricate character study that captivated audiences, this sequel leans heavily into absurdity without any real depth. The plot feels disjointed and meandering, trading emotional resonance for chaotic scenes that lack purpose. While the performances remain strong, they're overshadowed by a convoluted script that seems more interested in shock value than storytelling. The once-compelling exploration of mental health becomes muddled in a sea of over-the-top theatrics. What could have been a nuanced follow-up instead feels like a desperate cash grab, leaving fans of the original feeling let down and confused."
1.0,5 October 2024,"The performance of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are so great. I thought the musical performances were the risky part in this movie, but those were also all great - integrated into mostly dreamlike sequences.

Still I was hugely disappointed when i left the theater. Other than the first part the characters deviate more and more from the source material to a point where the supervillain Joker is no longer the Joker.

Even minor characters in the story like Harvey Dent / Two Face suddenly have another story.

It feels like one of these dreaded ""alternate universe"" things gone dead wrong.

In fact, in the end i found this a Greek tragedy of the life of super victim Arthur Fleck. Like the stories protagonist I left tormented.

Summary: great performances, horrible story, avoid."
9.0,5 October 2024,
1.0,16 October 2024,"Look, i love Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker and he does a great job with him, but the musical numbers does turn it down a bit

I'm not saying that the fact that they turned the movie into a musical made it genuinely bad, it really has its moments, some of the songs like the first three was good and later on there were still good music sequences, but it does feel like they do drag it a bit.

Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix both delivered great performances as Harley and Joker and they both are good singers and the film is beautifully shot with the lighting and the dancing.

I still do agree that this is an completely unnecessary sequel and the story didn't always have me (especially the ending) but there is some good court room drama in this film and a love story between Harley and Joker.

I don't think this is the worst comic book movie of the year and it's a little underrated. Overall: An unnecessary movie but still has good moments."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Worst piece of garbage I've seen in my life. Todd Phillips took away from us everything good he gave us on the first one and make worst pile of garbage ever put on a screen. As days go by, the more I hate this movie.

The script is wrong, the singing has no sense, nothing has really. It's like Arthur suddenly knew there was something called ""music"". Lady Gaga is so off, it's like forced.

The movie clings from the first one and brings very little new. Everything is an eco from the first one.

In the end, we end up with nothing. Arthur's journey has no sense. Everyrhing was for nothing plus we get that horrific ""mountain song""."
6.0,3 October 2024,"In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get swayed by the opinions of others, especially when it comes to films that spark intense debates. Your encouragement to ""just go, and enjoy every moment"" ""Joker"" movie captures the essence of true cinematic experience-one that is personal and subjective. Rather than allowing external judgments to cloud our enjoyment, we should immerse ourselves in the film and form our own opinions. The beauty of cinema lies in its ability to evoke emotions, provoke thoughts, and challenge perceptions. By urging viewers to embrace their own interpretations, you highlight the importance of personal connection to the material. Every viewer brings their own experiences and background to the film, which shapes how they perceive the story and characters. This individual lens allows for a richer discussion and a more meaningful engagement with the film."

6.0,2 October 2024,Just saw it tonight... the movie itself had no plot line what so ever... just joker laughing without any purpose... did not see any point of watching this movie whatsoever. No action.. no great characters..no touching acting... or lines... just so so boring.. I had more fun watching the substance last night... at least it has some action and cool parts to it..even though it was so gory... much better than the joker... definitely do not waste your time to watch it.. how can they make joker & Harley queen seem so boring.. very disappointed.. bring back the old style of joker with action at least.
1.0,5 October 2024,"I love the 1st joker movie. I believe it's a masterpiece, a work of art. And this sequel feels like a huge slap in the face and just spits on this amazing story we had. I was intrigued with it being a musical, and it was done so poorly. Lady Gaga feels wasted in this movie with the talent she possesses. And the ending... WORSE THING IVE EVER SEEN. I won't say what it is for those people interested in watching it, but I feel like I wasted my money and time watching this atrocious movie. Even the marketing for this movie, I had no idea what they were going for. I was still hopeful that I would enjoy and maybe surprise me. But no, sadly."
6.0,5 October 2024,"I knew from the moment I saw the trailer and heard it was a musical that Joker: Folie à Deux wouldn't match the first film. The movie is very slow paced at times and the story is kind of messy and all over the place. Also, like the majority of people, I think the musical aspect of the film was very unnecessary. I don't hate the idea of putting 1 song (2 max) in the film because I do believe that's something Joker would think of in his mind while he's not in touch with reality but it felt like there was a musical number every 5 minutes and it gets old fast. I believe there was 15 songs in the film. Warner Bros. Was scared to market this as a musical so I'm not sure why they took that route to begin with. However, there are great things about this film like the cinematography and the wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix, just as we saw in the first movie. Lady Gaga was very good in this as well but I thought her character was underutilized, so much more could've been done there. If you loved the first Joker, you still might like this film. I'm kind of in the middle, I don't dislike it but it's nowhere near the first. It's not one I'd rush out to see right away."
1.0,12 October 2024,"I don't mind muscials but this was a bit to much. The DC joker character just falls flat and it gets really boring really fast.

I'm not a big fan of superhero movies but here it feels like they just wanted to erase the DC universe but still wanted to use DC universe most interesting character to lure in the fans. Did something happend after the last film and is there something of a grudge between DC and the director?

I lost interest in the storyline very quick, and i could feel my hand more and more reaching for my phone and usually thats not a good sign.

I understand he's showing the insanity or driven to madness and in the first movie it was clear as day but now.. it's there yeah, but that's all and nothing happens..

As of the acting, they deliver but it's not going somewhere it falls flat and the singing and dancing doesn't make it better. It's just boring.

But I do like the soundtrack!

I was excited for the sequel but now i'm just wondering did we really need a sequel?

4/10 and that's for the ok acting and the soundtrack."
8.0,10 October 2024,"Did you want a carbon copy of the first movie? Did you want a meme-filled fourth wall break? Did you want a sanitized, boring as hell, boardroom certified marvel cinematic universe movie?? The reviews claiming this is a sub 5/10 movie need to excuse themselves back to reddit. This movie isn't perfect at all and neither was the first movie, but this movie has soul and artistry. This clearly wasn't just some product pushed out of a machine like wonderbread. There was someone behind this that clearly cared about the end product. Look, maybe you don't like musicals, that's okay. Maybe this movie isn't for you. Not every movie has to be for everyone.

The songs in this are fun and mesh very well with the time period. Joaquin phoenix puts on yet another great performance along with a very good performance by lady gaga (I never thought I would type that). I do wish there was more mind-bending segments and social commentary like there was in the first movie admittedly. Maybe if they were included alongside the musical numbers it would be too much.

Ultimately, I liked this a whole lot. It had its issues that held it back from being an 8 or a 9, but it takes a lot of guts to make a sequel that isn't just more of the same."
7.0,14 October 2024,"If you thought the first Joker was a grim exploration of mental illness and societal neglect, buckle up for Joker 2, where the only thing more inflated than Joaquin Phoenix's ego is the film's attempts at profundity. This sequel feels like it was crafted in a fever dream fueled by bad coffee and an overzealous appreciation for existential angst-an experience so painfully cringe-inducing, I half-expected the screen to burst into spontaneous applause for its sheer audacity.

Every scene seems to be a masterclass in unintentional comedy, as if the filmmakers were on a mission to create a cinematic satire of themselves. The plot is an enigma wrapped in a riddle, smothered in nonsense, leaving audiences wondering if they accidentally wandered into a poorly scripted high school play. I can almost hear the production team whispering, ""Let's make it so bad, it's good,"" and I'm starting to suspect that they might have actually succeeded.

Let's talk about the dialogue, which feels like it was pulled from the bottom of a dumpster full of rejected TikTok quotes. Each line is delivered with the gravitas of a Shakespearean tragedy, but all I could do was laugh at how the writers seemed to think ""edgy"" was a personality trait. It's like they took the Joker's chaotic nature and decided to translate it into something utterly devoid of coherence.

Despite its monumental flaws, I can't shake the feeling that Joker 2 might just achieve cult classic status in a few years. Picture this: late-night screenings filled with devoted fans howling with laughter at the very moments the filmmakers intended to be serious. It's a bizarre world we live in when a movie can be so atrocious that it transforms into a kind of twisted masterpiece-though ""masterpiece"" might be a generous term when discussing something that feels like it was crafted by an intern on their lunch break.

In the end, Joker 2 is a testament to the fine line between genius and absurdity. It's a train wreck you can't look away from, and I wouldn't wish this film on my worst enemy,"
2.0,8 October 2024,"They really sing a lot in this movie. More than in a musical movie. You have to love that. I found it an added value because it made you see the difference in his fantasy world and reality very good. But it could really be a few songs less. I understand that people find it annoying in the end.

It was more of a psychological drama/thriller.

You see very clearly how he struggles with keeping the expectations high of himself but especially of others and that's where he fails. Then he finds out that it was really all a show and did it purely for others but never for himself. That is for me the reason that i think its a good movie

The funny thing is that in the first movie you really get to know him as a crazy man with very weird twists. But in this movie you're kind of used to him and he suddenly becomes normal. I wonder if people like that or not.

And in the end; he is a good actor."

6.0,6 October 2024,"I really think that the people who reviewed this totally missed the true story that was being told here.

This was never meant to be a DC verse movie and that's the entire point.

It was an exploration into mental illness snd what someone who truly suffers from their inner demons goes through.

This was all in Arthur Fleck's mind and Harley Quinzell's fantasy. In the end Arthur realizes his Joker persona was just a manifestation of his mental disorder.

I feel that Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga gave us a stellar performance! As did sone of the background characters.

No it was not the DC Joker & Harley Quinn that everyone was expecting to see. It was much much more!"
2.0,6 October 2024,"This movie was soooooo bad, had to make an account just for the review. How does the director take a 10 psychological thriller, into a 1 - musical... The creators totally lost there marbles on this one, vs the main character.

There is a song and dance sequence like every 7-8 minutes. Would have been nice, to have had a heads up that they changed the genre, as alot of us do not watch musicals. Maybe it was to accomodate Lady Gaga, but it totally missed the audiance. Hasn't been too many movies where groups of people are walking out of the cinema, but Joker 2 sure made that milestone. The director also misses a few details from previous movie and the batman franchise."
6.0,3 October 2024,"In what can only be described as a spectacular failure of filmmaking, ""Joker 2"" manages to not only disappoint fans of its predecessor but also insult their intelligence and passion. This ill-conceived sequel seems purposefully designed to humiliate and mock those who found depth and meaning in the original ""Joker.""

This catastrophe of a film is symptomatic of a larger, more insidious trend in Hollywood: the deliberate demoralization of the moviegoing public. It's as if the industry has collectively decided that creating quality, thought-provoking cinema is no longer a worthwhile endeavor. Instead, they seem intent on churning out soulless, cynical products designed to crush the spirit of anyone foolish enough to expect more from their entertainment.

""Joker 2"" isn't just a bad movie; it's a calculated assault on the very idea of meaningful cinema. It represents everything wrong with an industry that has lost its way, prioritizing propaganda and demoralization over making money. This film doesn't just fail to live up to its predecessor; it actively works to undermine everything that made the original ""Joker"" resonate with viewers."
1.0,8 October 2024,
6.0,5 October 2024,"Within the first five minutes of the sequel to Joker: Folie à Deux, I started to feel annoyed. Bad start. Fifteen minutes after, I started thinking oh ok, I can sort of understand why they've decided to add some musical numbers. But then, and for the rest of the 2hr 18 minutes film I kept asking myself what the actual (expletive) am I watching here?!? This is truly awful!

I really enjoyed the first film and whilst I think it took a reductionist approach to mental illness I still believe that the first film was well directed, with some of the visuals being pure magic at times. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, the supporting cast led by Robert de Niro was excellent.

Folie à Deux is, simply put, a pointless film and I expect it to be a monumental flop. I can only imagine the early development workshops for this film. 'How about we take our celebrated film in a completely different direction! Let's not have a story or a plot to drive it, let's chuck in Lady Gaga because she's still appealing to 12% of our preferred demographic meaning that we can turn this into a musical, but (here's the key concept) we'll only include the most irritating music imaginable.' To which the Executive Producers respond: 'I like it!'

An angry score of 2 stars because I'm generous. 1 star each for Joaquin Phoenix for his portrayal of a sad, weak and pathetic joker and Lady Gaga who was surprisingly good (pointless but good). Anyone who enjoyed the original will in all likelihood hate this sequel. Save your money, let it flop."
1.0,12 October 2024,"If there ever was a case for a very successful film not to have a sequel it was Joker directed by Todd Phillips. This film was not supposed to work but it did. The 2019 original was a huge success. It was a a comic book villains origin story but not really. It was a Joker film in the world of Martin Scorsese. Sort of Joker meets Taxi Driver. What Joaquin Phoenix did with his performance is legend. It's a great performance. It made so much money that there was no way that they wouldn't make a sequel. This stand alone Joker film did not need one. But we got it anyway.

The problem is that this new film Joker: Folie à Deux as it is called is pretty much a repudiation of the film that spawned it. The film is well made and again Joaquin Phoenix is great as Arthur Fleck/Joker but the direction that Phi The film is starts in Arkham State Hospital about 4 years after the events in the first film. We meet Lee. Supposedly Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga. Arthur and Lee have an instant attraction but then the film becomes a musical. This is for me when the film goes wrong. The musical numbers though well done are not really there to advance the story. They are supposedly or not in Arthur's head they mostly ruin any dramatic weight in the film. There are a couple that fit well but the rest just make the film feel slower. I admit I really don't like musicals but this dud not fit. A couple well placed numbers would have been enough. But Phillips made this a musical. As much as he says it isn't. It is. Arthur is battling with his dual persona. Is he Arthur or Joker? That would have been great to explore but the film is too busy with the musical scenes that there is no focus on it. Lady Gaga is good in the film but she brings nothing special to her role except that she can sing. It's obvious why she was cast. But there is not really any arc fur her character.

There are some interesting directions this film could have gone but it seems that the only thing Todd Phillips was interested in is deconstructing what he built in the first film. Joker was a character study but it had a sense of danger. Joker: Folie à Deux has a couple of scenes that have that sense of danger but the film is so caught up in being a musical that all of that is lost.

I understand that this film is getting savages as a complete disaster. I disagree that it's terrible but it's clear that it's a film that shouldn't have been made. It seems that these days a film like this is either loved or hated. I certainly did love it but I didn't hate it either.

The first Joker was great as a stand alone film. It was technically in the Batman universe but it was very much about Arthur becoming Joker. It proved that a film that was about a comic book character could world work as something other than an escapist fantasy. Joker: Folie à Deux seems to exist to revert what was done in the first film.

They should have left the first one as the only film in this iteration of the character.

Not horr, but disappointint and unnecessary....

Grade: C."
9.0,11 October 2024,"What a downer. After a 5 year wait we get what may be the worst sequel of modern times. Lady Gaga was a terrible choice. I cannot unsee what I saw but I wish I could.

Every time I thought okay it's going to get better now it actually got worse. That alone was a difficult task to achieve. Lady G is not the entire problem. There is the script, the pacing, and too much music. It like they wrote this for her and the Joker was a sidekick. As a Joker fan that not why I paid good money for this disaster.

Phoenix is a great actor be even he could not salvage this train wreck of a sequel. I would say maybe the third installment will be better but I would advise them to just stop after two. Don't ruin it even further."

The cartoons at first so unfunny.

It was so cringe to watch !

I'm so irritated. ""Joker"" was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. It was a raw, dark film that didn't need gimmicks or unnecessary changes to make a statement. So WHY in the world would anyone think it's a good idea to turn ""Joker 2"" into a musical?

This is a slap in the face to fans of the original. We didn't ask for dancing and singing - we wanted more of the same unsettling atmosphere, not a Broadway-style number in the middle of Gotham's madness. I signed up for a continuation of Arthur Fleck's descent into chaos, not a flashy musical break that completely destroys the tone.

The first ""Joker"" was a masterpiece. This sequel choice feels like a desperate attempt to be ""different"" without respecting the core of what made the character and story so compelling. Ridiculous decision."

I dont understand what was the purpose of this film and also something that i dont get is why they keep it hide until the last moment that this was a musical. I hope tha i dont get disappointed also the the Gladiator 2, because if you are going to create a second movie after a great first movie you need to have the responsibility not to destroy what it has been created so far.

I am putting 2 because of the effort and sacrifice of the Joker role."
6.0,13 October 2024,"Drawing inspiration from Disney, the movie shifts to soliloquies in the form of 3 minute songs that a sung by an amazing new singer called Joaquin Phoenix, who struggles with singing as the character he plays struggles with life in the movie.

Whats worse is that the title character is degraded in a way that you will feel a stinging pain in your heart everytime the name Joker is called out.

Only satisfying thing about the movie is the ending which perfectly syncs up and you feel at ease after watching the entire movie if you were able to reach this far without leaving your seat mid movie.

The movie makes you feel like the joker, depressed and makes you laugh for no reason every 15 minutes. You laugh at your condition and your decision on why did you even care to watch this movie."
1.0,2 October 2024,"It's good to relax but I'm still disappointed because the first one was much better but the movie is still funny. A lot of people are super disappointed and I understand them, Even though the movie is very funny, the movie doesn't have a lot of action and it takes a long time for the story to get going. The first one had a lot more action and twists and the 2nd one not much action and twists it's a kind of musical but it's still a good movie for the family. I I would classify this film as not recommended for children under 14. 6/10(If there are mistakes it's normal because I use Google Translate)"

I suspect that it was written the way it was written because all parties involved were offered a ridicules amount of money to do a sequel to something that they thought didn't really need one and made sure another would never happen.

The first Joker was made on a low budget and netting a insane amount of money. This one has a high budget and will probably lose an insane amount of money.

Anyone who's read or seen anything with the Joker in keeps expecting big things and we get let down in the end. I liked this movie's version of Harley Quinn until they pull the rug underneath what could have been a crazy love story."

🎬 Just watched ""The Joker 2"" and I have to say, Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the iconic character was truly mesmerizing! 🃏🌟 Despite a few slow moments, his portrayal kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Plus, Lady Gaga's take on Harley Quinn added an exciting twist to the storyline! Overall, a solid 6.5/7 out of 10 rating from me! Can't wait to see what's next for these characters! . Harely character needed more development and I think if they had developed it more we would had a better movie. The songs gave it a nice twist as well. I also wish more dc characters were used in the movie it might have given it more depth ."

It is also not like the arkham games. And it is also not the stereotypical comic variation. I thought we all got that by the first one, but I guess people are still fixated on their Idea who the Joker is and what he is supposed to be. Thats what this movie tries to analyze. The Joker is an idea, a persona. Not a real person. As soon as you start to uncover an identity behind that, it all falls apart. Multiple people can become the Joker and take on that mantle. There is no definit one. For arthur Joker is a coping mechanism to escape realty. Arthur is not the Joker all of you expected, he is not what you wanted him to be. That makes us no better than all the citizens of gotham in the movie. We are trying to project our expectations of Joker onto that little broken man. Because thats what we want. So yes in social commentary this movie is a master class. You did just not get, that no this is not a superhero nor a supervillain movie."

In fact half was through I decided to get up and go to a coffee shop around the corner from the cinema to grab some drinks for us as I was bored to death. When I returned it was still on the same scene... slow talking... yawn! I'm a huge lady gaga fan and really wanted this to be good and do well... it was super disappointing, very long unnecessarily and incredibly slow to get to any point whatsoever. I still don't know what the writers and director were thinking and very surprised the A list cast even agreed to star in this."
7.0,17 October 2024,"Good - the character stayed true to the first film.

Bad - so many different angles that where presented during the film, so many opportunities to make it as brilliant as the first but unfortunately it felt like it a was a money maker to get people back in the cinema with the memory of the last film. Very disappointed, very frustrating, if your a joker fan then give it a miss.

It was always going to struggle with the first film being so good and because of that I gave it 2 extra stars, otherwise it would have been a 1 star for me.

Best part of the movie was the Nacho's and cheese dip... Delicious."
1.0,16 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a mediocre follow-up to what was a brilliant first film. In all honesty, this sequel never should have existed. Heading into the cinema, I was bracing myself for a disaster-social media had already set my expectations to rock bottom. To my surprise, it's not completely unwatchable, unlike some other films I've regretted sitting through. However, that's hardly praise.

The film lacks a compelling plot or engaging narrative. Its appeal is mostly confined to the beginning and the end, leaving the middle as a drag to sit through. It's clear the director attempted something different, and while experimentation can often yield exciting results, this wasn't one of those instances. Instead, the movie feels like a misstep, failing to entertain or captivate. It's an effort that ultimately falls flat, leaving me questioning why this sequel needed to exist at all."
6.0,4 October 2024,"I've never seen a follow up movie revert so far back with a character when creating a sequel.

The joker/arthur fleck at the start feels like he's reverted back to the beginning of the first movie.

The back story for Harley Quinn as a character was non existent and changed like it wasn't important. The whole point of Harley is to show the impact of the joker n how he changed her, this was basically skipped.

The musical aspect was sickening to the point I left after 1 hour and 15mins because I just couldn't watch it anymore.

We've all been made aware of directors straying from source material e.g. Henry cavill with the Witcher series, halo etc.. Here we are again.

I understand that the musical aspect worked from the first movie but having the characters in a dark story singing is just bizarre and completely different from having an iconic character dancing to a fitting soundtrack. It felt like the movie and story was adjusted to accommodate GaGa, like she'd had a musical clause in her contract.

Overall I've never been so disappointed. To have such potential and destroy it like that was sickening. Surely seeing the Batman and penguin success, the blueprint was there and ignored.

If I could get a refund I would. Joker 1 was different but still the joker. I don't even know what to call this. Save your money. Stay at home."

10.0,6 October 2024,"This is what happens when you have a producer/team that actively hates the movie or show they're supposed to make. Calling this a movie is an insult to other movies.

Now I know that some people have a problem with it being a musical, which I'm personally not a fan of, but that's somehow the least bad thing about this thing. It's not a decision many people would have made, but it definitely could have worked if this were a stand alone movie, instead of sequel, which it barely is.

The problem is more with the message & what they've done with the main character, which they clearly despise. Why make a movie you don't wanna make, about a character that you hate? Who knows. I'd say they did it for a quick paycheck, but that's not gonna happen with this monstrocity.

Todd Phillips has admitted that comic movies aren't real movies to him, which is an opinion he's allowed to have, but then why make a comic movie then? And when it turns out to be a success (1st Joker movie) & you still hate it, why would you instead of doing the same thing again, sabotage the movie on purpose just because you personally don't like it?

If you don't like the work you're doing but you need the paycheck, there's 2 options. You either do the work for the money or you find a different job that you actually want to do. He picked another option, do the job very poorly so you don't get anything out of it. Not exactly a smart move.

Now for the actual message of the movie, it's very clear what they were trying to tell the audience, because of how subtle it was, like a hammer to the face. ""you need to stay in line & do as you're told or there will be consequences. How dare you have hope or agency or stand up for yourself, you must be punished"" a message so despicable it made the audience & the critics agree with each other, which rarely happens, but miracles do exist, they just come in the most unexpected ways.

As someone who liked the 1st movie, I'll pretend like this thing doesn't exist. How they managed to build up a character, just to break him down constantly in this is just sad. They really wanted to make us dislike this movie & they've succeeded."

Joker 2 masterfully threw us into the spiraling madness of Arthur Fleck, and I loved every second. The visuals and sound design were absolutely stunning. Not to mention the phenomenal acting performances. While this was not as perfectly crafted as Joker 1, I truly felt this story took the idea of what ""Joker"" could be to new heights. Personally, seeing this beloved character be taken from a comic and placed into mythos was a delight for me to witness. The Joker has transcended. Beautiful...truly beautiful."

I would not watch it again on my own probably.

But if I had to it would not hurt, but I would be bored.

I avoid spoilers and commercials like the plague so it being a musical and it is absolutely a musical completely caught me off guard. Several people involved here should never work in the industry again. Where the original sucks you into the character this one simply leaves you repulsed. The effort of the performers is there but its so stupid it leaves the actors unredeemable. Luckily they cashed in on the first movie because its going to have to oay for the second.

1.0,8 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" fails to capture the brilliance of its predecessor. The film's narrative is disjointed, lacking the emotional depth that made the first installment so impactful. Characters feel one-dimensional, and the introduction of new faces only adds confusion rather than intrigue.

Despite Joaquin Phoenix's commendable performance, it feels wasted on a weak script filled with uninspiring dialogue. The cinematography, while decent, cannot save this film from its numerous flaws.

In short, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a tedious and disappointing sequel that does not live up to the legacy of the original. I cannot recommend this film to anyone looking for a meaningful cinematic experience."
7.0,13 October 2024,
5.0,12 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" isn't just disappointing-it's an outright travesty. What was once a raw, gritty exploration of societal rage and alienation has been neutered into a shameful, politically influenced spectacle. The original film, which was one of the most powerful and daring productions of its time, is now reduced to a lifeless, watered-down, and overly produced shadow of itself. This sequel feels more like a forced correction, bowing to external pressures, and turning what should have been a continuation of a bold narrative into a hollow political musical. The heart of the character and story has been completely lost."
2.0,6 October 2024,"Let's begin by saying that this film is nowhere near as bad as many as insisting. The original Joker is a stand-alone masterpiece that didn't need a follow-up but was forced to have one due to it's colossal financial success. That accepted, Todd Phillips appears to have been of the attitude that, ""You want a sequel? I'll give you a sequel!"" approaching this second flick with the same anarchic irreverence that Arthur Fleck himself might approve of.

What we end up with is a bizarre love-story musical / courtroom drama hybrid, interspersed with show-tunes and dance sequences imagined by Joker as he enters the throes of love, having finally found a soul-mate (or so he thinks). The problem is that few of the musical numbers propel the story forwards or even add to it, not least of all because there's very little story to shift. There's an amusing rendition of ""If My Friends Could See Me Now"" and a genuinely poignant and fragile version of Jacques Brel's ""If You Go Away"", but Lady Gaga is pretty much under-used, and Phoenix is certainly no singer.

In terms of drama, the film merely treads water, though the scenes outside the courtroom and prison smack beautifully of the same dark, dank imagery used so superbly in the first film. What this means is that we have some excellent atmosphere but no real substance, at least for most of the 140 minutes on offer. For much of the time, the audience is left intrigued by certain ideas - about where the film might be going - but so much is left unrealised, that a sense of disappointment is probably unavoidable.

However, the real reason why Joker: Folie a Deux might leave lovers of the first film so disillusioned is that the former undoes much of what Joker presented. If Joker was the tale of a desperately unhappy, abused and lonely man finally finding his voice and identity through his own insanity, this sequel drags Arthur back to reality - to the point where he has to face who and what he actually is. In that respect, Phillips, Phoenix et al deserve huge credit for an audacious attempt to give the public what the do NOT want - to make even the biggest fans of the first movie realise that they weren't watching what they thought they were watching all along. That alone is an incredible attempt at something different and deserves credit.

Does the film succeed? Not really. There again, to quote Malcolm McLaren, ""Better to be a spectacular failure than any kind of benign success."""
6.0,13 October 2024,"Joker 2 was an atrocity following the first movie. No matter the intentions of the studio, investors, or director, it's insane how far this movie got without anyone stopping for a second to say, hey, this is like, horrible?

The movie tries so hard to get a message across and it results in one of the best actors ever tap dancing next to one of the worst actresses ever. I love Joaquin per usual but it should've been him on the big screen instead of focusing on lady gaga and his followers. The movie is called ""Joker."" He doesn't have a dual personality. This is dumb. He is a villain from a comic book. The songs also sucked."
1.0,5 October 2024,"The movie changed the line from the first movie.

And the good thing is the showing of the joker as convict, which continue his personality as joker.

Lady Gaga is just another perfect actor.

Phoenix fully immerses himself in the role, showcasing a chilling blend of vulnerability and volatility, showing the character deeper issues about mental health, societal decay, and the human condition, His direction is restrained but effective, allowing Phoenix's performance to carry much of the emotional weight while using the city as a character in its own right.

The next movie we hope to show the evilness of the joker and his smart tricks.

Best wishes from a fan."
6.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, was visually amazing; emphasis on ""visually."" Yes, I sat through it all, and I didn't feel it was a complete waste. It was good in the aspects it always was. Though this is a sequel, we really shouldn't be comparing this with the first Joker. Folie à Deux embraces the road of sharing trauma and how to deal with it correctly while focusing on a romance between the leads. When I say it was visually amazing, I mean it. The film perfectly captured the acting, the visual essence, and its expectations the first film had set. There were some scenes that screamed ""mind-blowing,"" and the music. Oh God, the music. Was the music good? Sure. But was it too much? Oh, absolutely. The music was too much. TOO MUCH. Don't get me wrong, yes, I love the different take on this movie by adding original songs. But they overdid that by jamming it with songs that weren't needed in certain scenes. Not every scene needs a song. I'll try to phrase it without spoiling. Joker: Folie à Deux is, in itself, amazing. The visuals, the acting, the score behind, the sets, even the dialogues maybe. But the songs were a bit too much in terms of quantity. No hate to the creators, but honestly, it ruined the entire experience. I believe taking a more selective approach could've been stronger, letting the story breathe with the right dialogue moments. Oh, and there's the big miss that the writers did. The first film was about how Joker symbolized the struggles of the common or the low folk, while in the sequel, you stripped him of that title. This made absolutely no sense in any way, and this is the one thing that acts as a complete opposite to what the first film stood for. But hey, all this is my opinion. Some might like the movie, some might not. It's the whole point of a review that it's your own opinion.

I would give it a 7.8 out of 10."

I am amazed they thought this was going to be a good film when they made it so delusional.

Hopefully that is the last of that and a forgotten memory in the world of, oscar wanting directors and actors.

There are no spoilers since there is nothing to spoil. Very little happens in the film outside of the incessant musical numbers. I couldn't stop sighing louder and louder when they broke into song every five minutes. That must be why they included Lady Gaga. Couldn't they get someone with a smidgen of acting ability? Her music is not in my wheelhouse, but let's be honest, she can't sing without musical accompaniment. Not here, anyway.

My question is- who is this film for? Not fans of the first film. Not fans of the comics, I take it. A useful re-title would be Joker: La La Land."
7.0,7 October 2024,"This is a very well made film. First the cinematography is excellent. Beautifully filmed and atmospheric. The acting is top notch. I didn't know what to expect going in and I had heard it was a musical which made me uneasy. I'm not the biggest fan of musicals but when it's well done like Chicago I can tolerate them. The musical numbers here were ok I guess. When looked at as a fantasy world in the head of the character it kinda works. By the 3rd or 4th number I thought to myself that either the music numbers repeat the same point or don't say much at all. As with the first film this sequel is dealing with some serious mental health issues. After I saw the first one I remember thinking, ""I don't want to see Batman punch this guy, I want to hug him"". It's the same here. It's hard to look at Author as a villain. This movie made me cry at least twice. When Gary Puddles is on the stand I was balling. I really don't know if this is a good movie. I admired the technical proficiency on display. A lot of talented people made this movie. I don't think I'll watch it again."

So if they are to loose money over this production, then it's them choosing their own destiny. And please don't go watch this garbage. Save that money and go watch something else. And probably wait for this to release on netflix so you can fast fwd the entire film and save time."
3.0,10 October 2024,"Joker folie a deux picks up the story of the Joker after being locked up in Arkham Asylum for the crimes he committed in the first film.

This time, we see a saddened Joker trying to escape the reality of the gloomy asylum by resorting to one of his lesser-known facets: singing.

After several months locked up and depressed, an event seems to change the course of his reality; on one of his visits to a minimum security wing of the asylum he meets a girl who claims to be his admirer. Joker falls madly in love with her and fantasizes about getting out of jail to have a life together; however, she ends up breaking his heart by rejecting him towards the end of the events.

I personally think that this sequel of the Joker disappointed many for not continuing along the path that characterized the first one, that is, we practically see no scenes of violence or where the Joker gets upset. Let's remember that his defense mechanism to escape reality is fantasy with Harley and singing.

We have a Joker anesthetized by love who is capable of doing anything to satisfy his partner's desires.

I think that the singing scenes, particularly the duets between Joker and Harley, are well done and contribute a lot to the story; they make a good couple on screen."
6.0,5 October 2024,"Really wanted to like this but the whole film just had no substance and just went nowhere!

Also the ending just made no sense.

It needed less singing and more action.

The singing wouldn't have bothered me if the storyline had some substance and went somewhere but just when you think something was going to happen it falls flat.

The acting in the film was good and lady gaga did a good job, however the storyline was just boring and dragged out.

The characters they displayed didn't give me joker and harlequin, the joker was made to look weak while harlequin was made to look like the stronger one which should be the other way round.

Overall I wouldn't recommend."
3.0,8 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is simple a movie that could not follow up on the sheer brilliance of the first masterpiece of a movie.

Joker: Folie à Deux is still a movie filled with brilliant acting from the lead man (Joaquin Phoenix) with a refreshing twist of the character Harley Quinn by Lady Gaga.

The use of music is something I think that has been unrecognised to Arthur's mental state as the film goes along. The songs get more dramatic and crazy as the film goes on and I think this was a very good way of showing just how crazy Arthur truly is. To add, the performances of the musical scenes of these films are purely brilliant. Lady Gaga shows just how much of a talented artist she is and Joaquin Phoenix truly holds his own.

Although the ending has been seen as disappointing by some, I think this ending opens up this story to be expanded even more and for us to be opened to a new world of The Joker.

Overall, Joker Folie à Deux is a very entertaining watch with strong lead performances. I think the struggle for people to have their own opinion and to just follow the trend of throwing hate towards something because it is seen as funny or trendy is what's destroying this films reputation."

1.0,5 October 2024,"Spend you 2 hour in something else!!!

The new Joker movie was a boring, repetitive, and extremely disappointing experience. What started with potential quickly went downhill. The plot felt recycled that turned into cheap musical. Nothing innovative same sound, same lights, same scenes, leaving me uninterested and disconnected throughout the entire runtime. One moment i felt even sleepy and forced myself not to.

Lady Gaga's performance, which was highly anticipated, fell flat. She didn't bring the energy or depth needed for her role, and her portrayal was far from memorable. Overall, the film was a disaster-poor pacing, uninspired direction, and two hours wasted. Definitely not worth the hype."
7.0,13 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a technically brilliant film that succeeds at everything it sets out to achieve purely from an artistic standpoint. Except, it falls through the floor at delivering a decent story.

The cinematography; the way the film is lit and framed is excellent, with many spotlight shots, one-takes, and camera movements all exploring the amazing set design. The acting from across the board is fantastic, both from returning and new cast members, with the stand-outs of each being Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as Arthur and Lee, respectively. But even Brendan Gleeson and especially Leigh Gill get really great moments to shine as well. The musical aspects and musical numbers are all really good, either talking a more grounded route in treating the real world like a stage or having completely fantastical sequences with throwback set designs. Also, there are many set-ups to ideas in this film that are interesting; introducing the Joker to Harley Quinn, Joker in court, analysing the morality behind Arthur's actions in the first movie, and its all legitimately interesting stuff.

However, where the movie fails is its lack of motivation for follow through. Much like the first film, the characters are nothing like their comic counterparts and act soley to be more grounded in their depictions as actual characters rather than caricatures, hence its more about Arthur Fleck and Lee Quinzel, rather than the Joker and Harley Quinn. The overall story is a disjointed mess, abandoning one idea to explore the next as if the film's just not interested in the previous concept anymore or too afraid to finish it. And the final scene sums up this problem in the most anticlimactic and perhaps embarrassing way possible, rendering this film as well as its predecessor as a waste of time. And aside from the musical numbers looking and sounding great, in the context of the movie they either come off as awkward or repeating information the audience already knows. But the biggest issue this sequel has is the fact that it wasn't really warranted to begin with, as the first film acted perfectly as a self-contained story and is somewhat lessened now because of this one's failure to be of equal calibre.

Overall, this movie is ultimately an unnecessary epilogue that is more well made than it has any right to be, and aside from the plethora of talent that holds it high up, the weak story creates weak foundations that results in this film crumbling down to the feet of its better half."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Make no mistake when I say Hollywood there's a specific group of people I'm talking about. If you're not smart enough to know we'll leave it at that. With that said how do you go from a movie that was bringing people together talked about the negative society and everything else to a musical which is the most hated genre of films there are. Someone up top and Joaquin Phoenix that they needed to do this film and they did it because that's what you do there's no way you wanted to make this.

It's great because it does two things makes you forget about the first and also forget the message as well."

7.0,15 October 2024,"I can't fathom anything my eyes just saw. If you watched the first movie, do not watch the second. In this situation, forever hold your peace.

It is crazy how stretched thin this movie was, especially out of something with bountiful potential. Honestly, a bleak movie within a bleak environment. There was zero substance.

I'm gonna keep this brief for those reading it and for the sake of their time, so everything I'm gonna say is this: It is an exhausting watch. You will sit there, and the only love you will find, is the one you find in this attractive person named ""Clock.""

Joaquin and Lady Gaga carried this movie on broken backs, man. Throughout the movie, those poor guys are having a battle against such an awful storyline and overall awful directing.

The disappointment is palpable."
1.0,5 October 2024,"This film resembles Indian movies but features outstanding actors. Fenix and Gaga truly impress with their talent. They deliver amazing performances, but the screenplay leaves much to be desired. The constant singing becomes annoying, as it distracts from the plot. However, thanks to the excellent acting, you can appreciate the emotions they convey. If there were fewer musical numbers and more focus on the storyline, it could have been a real masterpiece. Overall, it's worth watching, but be prepared for the overwhelming music. That's why I give it a rating of only six out of ten.

... Required character."
2.0,9 October 2024,
6.0,6 October 2024,"While I can't convince anyone that this was an enjoyable movie I cannot help but wonder why they allowed Gaga to keep her lip fillers during production. As trivial as this may sound I need to be immersed in the world the director and actors create. This is something that the first film executed flawlessly. The grimy NYC vibes and mishmash of 80s Scorsese somehow worked and I didn't question what era we were in.

Did Todd Phillips really think this little detail would not be noticed in the instagram era? The film takes place in the 80s where this trend was not in vogue so it took me out of the experience when she came on screen."
1.0,4 October 2024,"It can be frustrating to spend time on something that doesn't live up to your expectations. Sometimes, the anticipation can make the disappointment feel even worse. If you're looking for a better movie don't watch it.

Joker: Folie à Deux"" (2024) has generated a lot of anticipation, but it can be frustrating when a film doesn't meet your expectations. While Joaquin Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck, his performance, along with Lady Gaga's as Harley Quinn, struggles to find the emotional depth needed to carry the story. The film's ambitious blend of musical elements often feels forced and distracts from the darker themes. Despite its striking visuals and attempts at psychological exploration, the uneven pacing and lack of cohesion may leave viewers disappointed."
7.0,15 October 2024,"So like many others I purposely didn't read any reviews or watch the trailers as I was so excited for this sequel. I'm a huge Batman/Joker fan but I've left the cinema tonight feeling so confused!!

The film was so messy with random scenes all over the place, meaning there was no real story line that could be followed. I love GaGa but didn't find her convincing, she just seemed to be there with no real depth to her character. Joaquin is a great actor and the 3 stars I gave this film were mostly for him, he is a great Joker but this film just didn't take off. And why o why did they make this film as a musical!? The weirdest decision EVER!! So so so bad."
1.0,5 October 2024,
6.0,9 October 2024,"Let's start with simple questions.. Where's the story? Why did you make it musical? Where's the production house inputs when they saw that vision from the director? Why didn't they respect the fans?

Yes this movie and the director did not respect the fans of Joker or DC!! We were waiting for five years to see Joker's effects on people and how they would react and destroy the city. You could do the hospital and the court scenes in first 30-40 minutes then start the epic battles and the tricks of Joker and his followers!

Joker for the fans is the devil and the destroyer not a man who only laughs!!!!

Honestly, BIG disappointment!!

I have to give credit to Joaquin Phoenix for his performance and for the general mood."
1.0,6 October 2024,
9.0,5 October 2024,"If you like the first Joker film, don't watch this installment! The joker we were introduced to in the first movie is no more. Instead, we have the beaten down, broken Arthur, who gets hammered down even lower as the film progresses. And why is lady ga-ga here? Seriously?! Did someone decide that the first film's premise was far to close to the hearts of modern audiences and then panicked and insisted a strong independent female come in and join in on stomping the life out of the joker? It would appear so! And why make this a musical? How does that in anyway shape or form link up to the first film?

What a wasted opportunity. Hollywood just keeps swinging and missing!

People liked the joker because it was about a guy standing up for himself. Arthur becoming the Joker was seen as what can happen when someone snaps, something most people can relate to, it's a dark fantasy. In this, the second film, it's as if Arthur/joker is just being punished over and over again, to the point where the joker no longer exists and Arthur is more broken than before. Is this some kind of message to the downtrodden? Know your place, go with the narrative, do as you're told or else?

I really don't understand why they chose to go in such a direction with this film."
6.0,4 October 2024,"Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix were fantastic. Acting could not be critiqued at all.

There were a few people in the cinema that walked out... pathetic and dramatic. Definitely is not that bad!

Main points for me:
I liked the musical bits in the 'real world' when they sung, but didn't feel the fantasy scenes were necessary. The only one I would've kept was 'the joker' in the courthouse, as that was amazing!


The ending (no spoilers) needed more, I would've liked to see Joker run off with an army of jokers who freed him to then become a bit of a terrorist."
1.0,4 October 2024,"The whole movie lacked any clear sense of direction. The trailers and posters are misleading. The whole thing feels like a sad, drab drag! Pointless songs from Todd Phillips' everyday playlist. It feels like a terrible vanity project for Phillips. Lady Gaga's rendition of Harley Quinn is absurd, horribly dull and irrelevant. The whole thing feels like an insecurity project for Gaga's mid-career crisis and fears of being forgotten! The biggest issue with the whole movie is the story lacking any sense of direction, a hodge podge of ideas from a drawing board mushed into short bursts across the movie. By the halfway point, all I wanted was for the movie to end! Unnecessary number of songs paired with visuals which have nothing to do with the movie. A bizarre pile of puke!"
1.0,2 October 2024,
7.0,6 October 2024,"Ok first off, this isn't a musical, this is Arthur's decent into madness , and part of that involves songs in his head, it's not big dance singing numbers with an orchestra, it's him singing as a normal guy on the street would sing. As with the first one you are never sure what's real and what's just in his head, although this movie does clear some of that up from the first.

If you're expecting a Batman movies then 1. Did you not see the first joker??? And 2. You're going to be out of luck

Only question for me is can an actor win a second Oscar for the same role ? He plays mad just that little bit too well :)"
1.0,8 October 2024,"Even though the first Joker movie and this movie is directed by the same director, it seems unbelievable considering what the 2 movies transmit to the audience.

They destroyed the Joker in the worst way possible.

This movie had nothing inside, was dead.

Can't express my disappointment in words.

Joker was one of the best 10 movies ever made, but it had to end with the worst outcome there is.

Gaga gave nothing in this movie, I did not see the point of converting joker in a musical.

During the whole movie I was expecting for the climax, for more happening, for the drama, and for all the emotions we went through the first Joker, but never happened."
6.0,3 October 2024,"Joker 2 is a disappointing follow-up that fails to offer anything new to the story or its characters. The film leans heavily on musical sequences to fill the runtime, sacrificing meaningful development. Lady Gaga's performance as Harley Quinn lacks conviction-she plays more of a version of herself than the complex, chaotic character fans expect. Her chemistry with the Joker feels off, as the power dynamic between them is reversed. Instead of Harley being obsessed with the Joker, it feels like the Joker is the one clinging to her, which makes DC's most iconic villain look weak and unthreatening. This portrayal softens the Joker into a shadow of the menacing figure he's meant to be, leaving fans missing Margot Robbie's far more engaging and authentic Harley Quinn."
2.0,13 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, and Brendan Gleeson, is a puzzling experience. After hearing all the bad reviews, I had to see it for myself-and now, I'm not entirely sure what to think. While it has potential, the constant musical numbers are the biggest drawback. If all the singing had been cut and replaced with simple dialogue, the film would have been much better-maybe not perfect, but significantly improved. The excessive musical sequences detract from the core narrative and make the film unnecessarily long.

The acting was moderate, not superb, especially given the talents of Phoenix and Gaga. It's hard to fully appreciate the performances when the movie leans too much into showy musical theatrics. Brendan Gleeson's presence was solid, but not enough to elevate the film as a whole.

One thing the movie did well was its intense close-ups, which captured the characters' emotional moments. However, even that wasn't enough to save it from its missteps. I noticed, logical people leaving the theater early, likely because their expectations were shattered by the unexpected musical format. If you're going in for a dramatic, gritty follow-up to Joker, be warned: this is not that movie."
7.0,6 October 2024,"I am writing a mere comment and still not using AI for this. Otherwise, I cannot explain the vast emptiness of responses to the numerous ""whyyyyy""'s I've felt when watching this. Never again, you ruined it. And to think that not even the amazing performance by Phoenix could save this movie, it says a lot. I do not understand how come nobody asked at some point ""where on earth are going with this movie? Should we turn back and change it maybe?"". Nobody? Everyone was thinking ""This is great, gonna be a huge success""? This is such a vivid example of how the industry will milk the success of a movie, making almost no effort for the next one. There will be more, I'm sure."
3.0,4 October 2024,"To simply put it , if you are going to this movie on the impression that it is as good as the first one, then you're mistaken, this movie movie is heavily focused on musical performances rather than storytelling. I like to look at the movie if it was without the music as a very long third hour to the first one. If you will go to the movie with an open mind like I was I think you'll enjoy it, but I don't think that hardcore fans would like it. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was spectacular as always, although I don't think the script was very generous to lady gaga as Harley Quinn. Again this movie is probably not for you if you're going to watch with high expectations or if you hate musicals."
10.0,5 October 2024,"This is by far the absolute worst movie I have ever witnessed, this movie is 3 hours of nothing, nothing happens Id rather watch a full season of paw patrol in -15 degree weather whilst slowly getting frostbite till my fingers fall off than watch that rubbish. Nothing like the first one, didn't achieve anything and ruined the Joker franchise, I mean idk who let that go into production? Anyone could have genuinely made a better movie on capcut, and who thought it was a good idea to make it an awkward musical where nothing happens. Ahhhh look never written a review ever but as soon as I walked out I knew I was writing a review to save everyone from watching that pile of trash. Thankyou."
6.0,5 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie À Deux"" continues the dark tone of its predecessor, focusing intensely on the complex relationship between Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley. The narrative unfolds largely in confined settings, heightening the emotional interactions. Despite a substantial budget, the film adopts a minimalist approach, leaving some viewers craving more action and dynamism. While many appreciate the serious and consistent storytelling, the unconventional format may disappoint others. Ultimately, ""Folie À Deux"" is a daring experiment that challenges expectations surrounding the Joker, but its appeal may not resonate with everyone."
2.0,5 October 2024,"The movie was for the most part a musical lacking any real storyline...bits and pieces of information thrown into it here and there but overall bland and seems thrown together... disappointed to say the least! Cheap thrown together movie if I've ever seen one .. Gaga is a fav but this wasn't a flattering role for her in any way. Sequel's are already hard to pull off with these movies, but it feels very little thought was put into the making of this movie. The ending was pointless it felt like a whole two hours focused on a court room and music. They could have thrown in some childhood throwbacks or something worth while!"
1.0,3 October 2024,
7.0,6 October 2024,"After watching this film most like me will say that director Todd Phillips took a different approach from his 2019 original. Picking up where we left off Arthur Fleck(in another good turn from Joaquin Phoenix) is in prison at Arkham awaiting trial. However aside from seeing his identity issues between his self and ""The Joker"" themes are introduced of love and music. In a wild card like way is character Lee(the talented Lady Gaga) who's given Arthur the hope and fantasy of love while introducing him to music which is like an escape for Fleck. While all of these themes play out the film has plenty of flashbacks and foreshadowing as Arthur sees it all in the form of his ""Joker"" past and present. Overall any ""D. C."" comics fan will watch this even though it does not have the laughs and punches of the 2019 original."
1.0,6 October 2024,"There is nothing good to say about this the director ruined it. The director took the story and threw it away. Rather than delivering a cohesive, engaging story, the movie feels like a vehicle for the director's personal vendetta. The plot meanders, prioritizing shallow shock value over meaningful character development and storytelling. It's as if the filmmaker took the iconic Joker character and used him as a mouthpiece for his own disillusioned worldview, sacrificing the integrity of the source material in the process. This self-indulgent approach results in a disjointed, emotionally hollow experience that fails to resonate with viewers. Instead of a thought-provoking exploration of the Joker's complexities, we're left with a shallow, artsy exercise in nihilism."
7.0,2 October 2024,"If you are a true fan of joker and you already really liked the first movie , get ready to be really disappointed cause you gonna hate this one.

Lady Gaga has proven to be a very talented actress, and combined with the Joker, you can expect a perfect movie with a touch of madness.

You expect something like the first part and even better , but finally you find yourself waiting for the movie to be finished.

Indeed I was thinking to left my seat and go home.

I think they sign and dance much more than actually have a dialogue or an action scene .

It's like you watch the La La land (Joker's Version) ."

1.0,7 October 2024,"Joker Folie à Deux takes note of 2019s Joker, but seems to have left them at home. Instead they attempt to recreate a masterpiece from memory with crippling Alzheimer's.

The musical scenes that many are so interested in reviewing, take up a good sum of screen time and serve as a way to show us the Folie à Deux in action. Unfortunately these moments pull you from the pacing and cause Joker Folie à Deux to feel drug out and sluggish.

The film would get a lower score from me had the last 15/20 minutes not been amazing. And I mean that. The last 15/20 minutes is a masterpiece and had they done that for the whole film, it would have been another Oscar winner. Instead, unfortunately it is a failure."
10.0,2 October 2024,
6.0,4 October 2024,"After watching this came out with very mixed feeling. I know this doesn't stand high as the OG Joker but but but the amount of hate this film is getting is too much I would say it wasn't a disaster but also not as outstanding as the first part. I love the creative choice of Todd Philips wanted to add some drama in the life of Joker as to express his dramatic life but the music it didn't go well sometimes it hits us but mostly i was getting annoyed that plan was good but the execution wasn't up to the mark. As we see in LaLa Land the music takes the movie forward as the story line and each music had its own way of expressing the story but here it fails. Besides the creative choices talking about the story, the plot the story was the X factor here whether it was Joker or Arthur Fleck who committed those crimes whether the Joker is a fiction in Arthur's mind or is it the real Arthur the movie puts you in this dilemma. I think the makers should have focused more on this aspect than putting unnecessary songs. And the ending was too confusing and a cliffhanger it forces you to think whether Joker is a person or thinking/character/a symbol/an image. All in all if you are expecting any more drama than the actual plot I wouldn't recommend it but if you love to think from the makers or the directors perspective what they want to convey through that story then you should go for it."
1.0,3 October 2024,"Let's be honest, the first film was great! A self contained tale about a man who was broken down and incredibly well told and acted! The second only just rehashes what was told in first film and drags on over prison and court scenes dragged over 2 hours and 20 minutes.

The musical parts are incredibly misplaced and Lady Gaga was just not great, she was ok but she's not a talented actress and to me was a very strange pick considering the musical side of it is so bad.

Pheonix is probably the only redeeming factor of the film and he makes it atleast watchable if your very bored and want to watch Joker in the prison/court and dream sequences that are terrible songs.

The good is Pheanix is a brilliant actor and anything he touches is gold. But it's nowhere near the original, skip it unless you really really care."
1.0,7 October 2024,"The photography was stunning throughout, and the acting was spectacular. I was hooked from beginning to end. The decision to make it a musical was really clever, as it adds a visual and emotional layer to the characters' psyches, especially when exploring their inner turmoil. The blend of music, emotion, and chaos felt fresh and unique. While the first Joker film gained a controversial incel fanbase due to its problematic message, I felt Folie à Deux offered a more nuanced experience. I don't see how someone outside of that context would hate this movie-it's a captivating, artistic journey, full of depth and complexity."
7.0,4 October 2024,"I just got out of Joker: Folie à Deux

This isn't a disappointment. It's a bad movie, full stop.

Todd Phillips has massively dropped the ball. Everything that was great about the first movie, is missing here. The first movie was meant to be a stand alone movie. But when it made as much as it did. Money talked and it may have talked about making a deadline for the release date, as this is a mess.

I don't read or watch reviews before I watch a new movie. But I seen a headline that said Joker Folie à Deux feels like it was bad on purpose. And I get what they mean as it seems Phillips is angry at the fans for making the first movie so successful. He has deliberately gone out of his way to make a movie, they will not even like, let alone love.

As what we get is a boringly paced, badly edited, totally unfocused movie, that never gets going, lacks any clear direction (it's all over the place) with a script that needed at least another rewrite.

I love a good musical. But the musical sequences in this, stop the movie in it's tracks. They do not belong in this movie. Take them out and you have a better movie. I'd say it's 50/50 songs and dialogue.

I think a lot of people, especially people who loved the first movie, are going to hate this. As Phillips totally tears the character of Joker down in a lot of ways.

I will say it looks gorgeous with some sticking images and it does have some moments of genius and real standout moments. I think everyone will agree on what the stand out moment of the movie is.

Joaquin Phoenix again nails it. Lady GaGa was great too, very charismatic, in a very poorly written role (she doesn't even really become Harley Quinn. She is very unlikeable and downright cruel.

I think she has been the victim of some last minute editing, as the ad campaign make this seem like she is co-lead. That is not the case at all. It's a supporting role. A lot of her stuff has been cut from the finished movie. The title doesn't even make sense Folie à Deux translates to a shared delusion. That is not this movie. Arthur and Lee share very little.

Brendan Gleason is great too, but when isn't he??

They should have turned down the money and kept it at one movie."
1.0,1 October 2024,"Big Batman Fan. Saw Joker multiple times. Tried hard to like this but couldn't. Almost walked out at first.

Dull. Boring. You get tired of all the musical numbers. No coherence. No story Just a long series of events that though beautifully staged don't add up to anything. I thought lady gaga was supposed to be a great singer. Here she is mousy and sounds terrible. Overkill. Over Shrill. Souless . Joaquin stands out. Delivers the joker from the first movie. But constant exposure is to much. Numbs you. Songs that are supposed to bear on the feeling or emotion of scene are just to much. Clever, yes. Enjoyable, no."

7.0,15 October 2024,"They wanted you to hate this movie, so whether you like it or not, they made exactly the movie they sat out to make. I enjoyed it, there's definitely some setbacks I'm not here to be like ""THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE"" but just watch it as a movie and you'll probably enjoy it. Watch it as an isolated movie like the first one was supposed to be. The fans of the first that begged for a sequel is why this movie was made, and Todd Phillips said ""bet, you asked for this"". It's not bad, not great, but it's an enjoyable movie. I'd say watch it and decide for yourself. I think if you go in with a clean unbiased mindset you'll be pleasantly surprised."
2.0,7 October 2024,"Not even gonna go into heavy detail here, everyone already has made the points. I'll just say this movie isn't just a ""bad"" sequel. Its a literal affront to the first one. Its like it regrets making the first one and wants to re-invent the wheel. Seriously, how can a sequel be so atrocious it makes you start questioning whether you liked the first movie in the first place?? Its certainly the first time its ever happened to me. The first Joker was without question one of the best movies i have ever watched. Joker 2 is without question one of the worst i have ever watched. Thats inconceivable. Never make a movie again Todd."
8.0,15 October 2024,"Review & Rating: Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring, unconventional sequel that ventures deep into the twisted psyche of Arthur Fleck, blending psychological drama with musical elements. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film embraces a bold shift by integrating musical numbers that offer a surreal, theatrical contrast to the dark, violent world of Gotham. Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an intense performance as Arthur, his character's mental instability mirrored in both the narrative and the musical sequences. Lady Gaga, portraying Lee Quinzel (a version of Harley Quinn), adds complexity to the story, with her musical numbers providing emotional depth and a wild, chaotic energy.

The musical approach is polarizing; for some, it adds layers of insight into Arthur's fractured mind, while for others, it feels disjointed from the gritty realism of the original film. Despite some narrative and pacing issues, the film is visually arresting and offers a unique experience, filled with both moments of brilliance and chaos.

Rating: 7/10 Though not without its flaws, Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and innovative continuation of the Joker saga, providing a provocative, albeit divisive, cinematic experience."
6.0,4 October 2024,"As much as I loved the first film. This one was no where near that one. I felt like I was watching a weird crossover between Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the Joker, but without the candy. The film was overloaded with singing and musical scene's. It even started to annoy me at a certain point when they started singing again.

All the singing distracted from the acting skills of the actors, and that was exactly what made the first part so good.

Why change a award winning film?

The cinematics and screenplay of this film where not that special anymore. The scene's didn't create a certain atmosphere like the first one did that highlighted the great acting skills of Joaquin Phoenix."
1.0,7 October 2024,"This movie is all about Joker and Harley, the story started with osm plot and expecting more from the team. The plot seriously really was osm, the way it started. But but ended like real waste. The screenplay and story was really average. The main de merit if thos film is the music and the songs. One or two songs are fine but it just reduces the phase of movie. The director todd is trying to convey something which in my point didnt work out, real poor screenplay. Lady gaga would have been avoided in this film, her performance is ok but thought she was forced to do this film which didnt connect. The impact and feel what we had from Joker 1 was surreal, it still impacts us a lot. This film toattly damaged the reputation. Phoenix oh man he is Jesus of acting. The only positivity was phoenix and his performances throughout the movie. Hope it becomes better later. Director Todd has really disappointed the audience. Pls do watch it if u really want available in theaters. Another demerit of the film is that many questions not answered not a perfect end."

during a Venice Film Festival press conference for this film Stephen Schaefer of the Boston Herald praises it yet wasn't the Boston Herald critic to review the flick, that honor went to Jake Coyle who called it ""Bleak and Boring""

Schaefer did post a positive headline about Folie a Deux but his article is behind a paywall at the Herald whereas Coyle's review and another headline titled ""'Joker 2' Stumbles"" are freely available there

what a hate train has been fueled against this flick!

And youtubers who might otherwise enjoy this movie have to think twice about wanting to give it a positive review --- there's the algorithm to think of, there's hateful backlash and a real possibility of loss of income for not toeing the line and going along with the echo chamber

a youtuber's credibility is at stake when they don't go along with a perceived consensus that's hateful, they also look up to monolithic publications and dream of having the respect of ""professional"" critics who write for such publications

i remain in shock at the reception to Folie a Deux because i left the theater convinced it would be a contender for best picture at the Oscars

ultimately i hope that the joke isn't on me but on the people who piled onto the hate train --- that eventually Folie a Deux will be recognized as a bona fide masterpiece

and it's not as though Folie a Deux is ""ahead of its time"" --- it's right ON time as its message is needed TODAY

the way the meta narrative has been a reflection of the story Folie a Deux tells i guess is the real art, but i wish it didn't have to be."

6.0,5 October 2024,"It's hilarious seeing so many highly rated reviews basically saying ""you guys just don't understand this movie"". Yea, sure, no possible way that you just happen to enjoy a terrible film right? The movie is pretentious, the plot is paper thin, and yes, there is way too much singing. It's hard to put into words how badly I dislike this movie.

Joker 2 is actually a perfect Joker movie in a way because it is in fact a complete joke. As many have stated, this movie was dead the moment they decided to make it a musical. Those who like musicals in general is already a very small audience. Those who like musicals and enjoyed the first Joker has to be such a tiny number it makes you wonder what the execs who greenlit this sequel were thinking because it was a truly awful film to sit through.

There is a reason virtually all live action versions of Harley Quinn have felt so bad in recent years, and it's because Hollywood is too scared to write her as she's supposed to be. The real Harley is supposed to be obsessed, infatuated, and completely crazy about Joker. For obvious reasons, Hollywood will not put this on screen because they're terrified of being called s*xist. Harley just has to be a stronk woman now and that's just never going to work because that's not what she is as a character. Simple as that.

Terrible movie, don't waste your money as this movie will be streaming inside of 6 weeks."
3.0,5 October 2024,"I'm disgusted with this movie. The musical is so annoying and unnecessary it makes the tone of the movie terrible. I don't understand the message this movie was trying to convey but I am thinking it had two different parts to it. Seeing the delusions of his character and seeing the whole joke on how the justice system portrays. Arthur Fleck just wants to be seen as a normal human. But seeing his crimes makes him a criminal and he has to fight it just for himself to be free. The ending was a slap in the face to the audience and for that reason the director is a nobody. Lady Gaga is cool but honestly how this whole movie went, I just don't want to remember what I watched."

3.0,5 October 2024,"What a bad movie. It had no storyline and no action was very hard to watch. I don t want to begin about the singing. Do you self a favor to not watch this movie. It is more sad for joker 1 to be associated with this movie. ""Joker 2 was a massive disappointment. The film drags on without any real substance, relying too heavily on forced symbolism and convoluted plot points. Joaquin Phoenix's talent feels wasted on a script that tries too hard to be deep but comes off as pretentious and dull. The pacing is sluggish, and it lacks the raw intensity that made the first film engaging. Overall, it's a tedious, directionless sequel that should've never been made."""
8.0,5 October 2024,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would someone ever turn this into a stupid musical? So much god dam singing. Every time they started up up with another so we were like you have to be kidding me. That is not what I'm looking for from a Jocker movie.

I definitely do not recommend anyone wasting their time and money on this. If my boyfriend and I were on an end seat we definitely would have walked out. I don't think I've ever checked my watch that many times trying to will the movie to end.

This was beyond boring. You could have made fifteen minute short to get across what happened."
6.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,5 October 2024,"The cinematography, sound design, set design, costumes are good. The actors, especially Joaquin, Brendan Gleeson and the 2 face actor, did not phone it in. That's pretty much all the positives I can say for this movie. This is probably the most competently made contempt piece ever.

There is no direction, it's a musical just for the sake of it. The musical aspect added nothing to the movie, other than probably inflating the budget due to the set pieces. There is very clearly a hatred for the character of Joker, and all efforts were made to cleave Joker from Arthur. Lady Gaga sings and acts well, but looks weirdly out of place.

Honestly just think that the 1st one was a standalone piece and don't bother sullying the memories of that masterpiece by associating it with this joke made at the expense of the audience."
1.0,8 October 2024,"The movie brings novelty, not relying on the formula of the previous. It's a story about suffering, a true drama about how cruel real life is. To make it softer, the musical format and a poetic narrative are adopted. It is a great work of art, but mass audiences expecting fun, excitement, or some repetition of the original formula will get very disappointed. What more real than a cruel world, full of obstacles, full of twists, with an unpredictable plot, and where what matters are not individuals, but the image they project? Still, the movie is more superficial than the previous, or at least more subtle on its depth, leaving for reflective audiences to get the deeper meanings."
6.0,9 October 2024,"You are here to feel validated for not liking the movie. You will find that validation when you see the quantity of 1 stars and poor reviews. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is not a bad film. Maybe it's just not the movie you wanted. Maybe it doesn't care as much about the legacy of the joker comic villain as much as you may. Maybe you don't like musicals. I don't know what your problem is, but chill out.

The film was inconsistent, but the acting perfromances, Gleeson in particular, are what in my opinion set this movie from being average, to being a decent film. There's a lot of bad film. A lot of over the top super hero movies. It's almost refreshing to see a played out villain story where we expect so many things due to our familiarity with the adapted literature, turned into a boring court room drama with some musical components. Really subverted my expectations, and I found myself laughing at just the idea of that, which is genius, because the production company, had to know this would piss off so many nerds and incels and low iq americans who devour action movies like cheesburgers.

The movie wasn't deep, im not saying that, but i did enjoy the critism of american symbolisation and fanaticism. I didn't love it, but I enjoyed my viewing. I tend to not love musicals and I didn't really like the first joker, but this one was funnier, more tragic, and a good fall date night movie to share and drink beers to."
1.0,15 October 2024,"The movie is unwatchable, boring, the sequence of thoughts is incoherent, singing, singing. Imagine with me someone coming up to you and asking you how you are and you responding with a song!!!

A distortion of the art of music, a distortion of the innate art of human response, and a weakness in writing.

From the time I entered the movie theater until the last moment, nothing changed as if I had not entered. The same sympathy from the first part transferred to the second without a plot. I sympathized a little with how the environment turned the Joker into the Joker, but the film did not succeed in presenting anything in the literal sense, a waste of time."
7.0,5 October 2024,The 3 is only for Joaquin's acting otherwise I would be with the ones. The most fascinating thing about the movie is how Joaquin got himself to look so frail. Looks like he starved himself unless it is movie magic. The description of jukebox musical is appropriate as there is singing throughout and full numbers not just snippets. Kept waiting for action but it was far and few between and mostly flashbacks to the first Joker. Gaga was brought in for the singing as her acting is B movie quality and if you don't like her singing the movie becomes torture. It would have been more interesting if they did more with her character with a different actress. This ended up being more of a prison movie than anything else. Save your money.

7.0,10 October 2024,"As Lady Gaga stands on top of the dead Jokers Corpse: She sings ""Barbie Girl"" in a slowed down Version with dramatic Strings and Big Orchestra arrangements. Everybody in the audience stands up for standing ovations. Some have been moved to tears. As they clap at this masterpiece of a deconstruction of this hero of the incel community, the joker lies in the remains of his shattered, misogynistic fever dreams.

Justice has been done, the audience got what they wanted! Another complete deconstruction of a toxic male hero like, Luke Skywalker, or Indiana Jones.

Thank you..... I whisper silently to the movie screen, as I left, holding hands with my non-binary Boyfriend as we leave. Thank you...."
3.0,5 October 2024,"Todd Phillips, I see you! The intention behind this sequel is so clear, and I believe that it was an organic continuation of the first movie. In my opinion, Arthur was never meant to be idolized, neither from the people in the movie, nor from the general public in the real world. It was not to generate a villain-hero, it was a commentary on social causes, on how society failed Arthur.

This sequel remarks the idea that we all got the first movie wrong. It screams: it is not what you think it is, this is not what we should be talking about (semi-cit).

Does this sequel add something to the story? No.

Does something really happen in the movie? No.

Was this movie necessary? Yes.

Acting-wise, Joaquin Phoenix is superb! Lady Gaga, despite relatively limited screen time, since scene one is utterly credible in the role of an unhinged and dangerous narcissist.

The only problem is: where is the folie à deux? This is probably my biggest critique to the movie. The idea behind the interaction of two main characters is very interesting, but I was left with the sense that it could have been explored more in depth.

I wasn't sure about the musical aspect of the whole movie, but overall it makes sense and I believe it works well in setting the scene of complete delusions that the character are in. A few musical numbers felt a bit off tho, either in the placement along the movie, or because completely disconnected from the narrative. Whereas Phoenix's performance of 'The Joker' really is pure art.

Overall, an Ok movie, with its highs and lows. Far (but not too far) from the first Joker. But ultimately directed to set the record straight."
10.0,3 October 2024,"As a huge fan of the first Joker movie I had been excited ever since I knew a sequel was being made, so you can imagine the disappointment someone like myself would feel after seeing this movie that was so unlike the first one and contained no essence of what made the first movie so impressive.

I thought it would be interesting having it be a musical and I thought they would incorporate songs in a clever way and make it seem organic but I was incorrect. Some of the songs did make an impact but 80% of the music sequences just felt out of place and really paused any momentum the movie had, which wasn't much.

Nothing really happened in this movie, it kind of felt like an unnecessary, added chapter to the end of the first movie, dragged out to a feature length film. I'm not sure who this movie was made for as it definitely wasn't made for the fans of the original movie, but I can't imagine it makes any new fans happy either.

Anyone coming for Lady Gaga will be disappointed that she is not used very well or often and her story leads nowhere. Anyone coming for Joker (while an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix) will also be disappointed with how his story unfolds as he doesn't have any agency in his own film and he is made out to be the joke of the film.

The movie is visually beautiful and the performances by Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix are great, and the movie does have some really funny moments but these are not enough to save the film. I would not watch this movie a second time even though I have watched the first film multiple times."
6.0,5 October 2024,"Todd Phillips' 'Joker: Folie à Deux' boldly transforms the gritty realism of the first film into a musical. Set in Arkham Asylum, it delves deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, now fully embraced by Joaquin Phoenix's chillingly transformative performance as the Joker and Lady Gaga's debut as Harley Quinn.

The film's ambition elevates it but unfortunately leads to its downfall. Joaquin Phoenix's captivating and unsettling performance, coupled with Lady Gaga's vocal prowess, creates a captivating chemistry, especially in the musical numbers. The choice of classic tunes and modern renditions offers a nostalgic yet eerie soundtrack.

However, the decision to make this a musical feels misjudged. The integration of songs disrupts the dark, brooding atmosphere of the first film, serving as distractions rather than deepening the narrative. This shift in tone dilutes the original's stark brutality, attempting to broaden its appeal but losing its impact.

The story and direction are well-crafted, but the musical elements detract from the overall impact of the film.""

Phillips' visually engaging homage to classic musicals struggles with a cohesive narrative. The film's excessive time in Arkham Asylum, while thematic, feels claustrophobic and repetitive. The plot, focusing on Arthur's trial and his budding romance with Harley, lacks the societal critique and rise-to-infamy arc of its predecessor. Instead, it centers on personal madness and love, which is intriguing but doesn't fully satisfy expectations.

Criticism centers around Harley Quinn's underdevelopment. Lady Gaga's performance is magnetic, but the script lacks depth and backstory to fully showcase her beyond her musical talents. The film's reluctance to fully embrace either its musical or dramatic elements leaves it in a thematic limbo. The potential for exploring the duo's dynamic is partially realized.

'Joker: Folie à Deux' is a film of contrasts: brilliant in its performances and musical moments, yet disjointed in its narrative and tonal consistency. It's a daring experiment that, while commendable, doesn't fully land. For fans of Phoenix and Gaga, or those intrigued by the unusual marriage of comic book adaptation with musical genre, there's enough to appreciate. However, for those who found the original's dark realism compelling, this sequel might feel like a step into a different, less satisfying universe. A 6 out of 10 reflects this film's ambitious yet flawed attempt at combining the criminal with the carnivalesque."
4.0,7 October 2024,"I've never seen a musical in cinemas where the longer it went on, the more you could feel the audience be like ""ugh, another musical number???"" I think part of why these musical parts fall so flat is that they really add nothing. Traditional musicals use the songs to progress the plot and keep the story moving, the songs in this film just paused the movie like an irritating commercial break.

The first movie resonated a bit too powerfully with the most dangerous segment of humankind, historically. The main message was one of revolution: subvert the dominant paradigm, kill the rich. But there was also an incredibly poignant affirmation for sufferers of trauma, especially that suffered by the movie's protagonist, and all too real and common in our society even if massively under-acknowledged.

I believe (and as always I must add that I could be wrong), that the studio execs, themselves somewhat wealthy, but especially pressured by the owners of capital who finance those studios (and nearly everything else), compelled a formerly unremarkable and less-than well-established director to disempower the sequel by rendering it a boring yet confusing musical inanity with the intention of at least capping the momentum of revolution and the empowerment of solidarity felt by the disenfranchised outcast represented by the Joker character in the first film.

Serious question: who is this made for? I can't see comic book fans, Lady Gaga fans, or even fans of the first movie liking this."
3.0,4 October 2024,"The Joker 2 is simply a better film than the first one in my opinion.

The original was well made but to me felt very derivative.

It didn't capture me like it did many others.

But this sequel was brilliant.

This is how the story had to end if it was set apart from the usual batman storyline.

This is about Arthur Fleck not Bruce Wayne.

And it was great to see a very nasty person get the ending he definitely deserved.

The Joker ridiculously became a hero to a lot of misguided people after the first film and it was sad to see his image alongside rather ridiculous quotes on some Facebook pages.

The use of songs was genius and Lady Ga Ga was pitch perfect is song and in her acting.

Showing that she was also a maniac who wanted to use Joker as a conduit for her unfulfilled psychopathic desires.

Harley Quin is a pathetic and nasty character here. No humour, one liners or comic violence in this version of her.

Just a liar and user.

This is a rare case of the sequel being much better than the last film.

If you want to see Joker v Batman watch the Dark Knight. It was definitively done there.

The Joker 2 is it's own thing."

1.0,5 October 2024,"From start to end it just made me wonder what was going through the writer and directors mind when coming up with this nonsense.

There was no substance to the plot or the characters, the dialogue was mind numbingly boring and the acting was absolutely horrendous.

The scenes that are ""In jokers mind"" don't really give you any idea as to what the writer wants to tell you about him - just bad dancing and singing as grating as it could be after the third song it just became such a chore to watch.

A brutal way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Squirmed with embarrassment for the cast whilst watching. Give it a miss."

4.0,6 October 2024,"Joker 2 is a sequel which was honestly not needed and is inferior to the first one. But it is not as bad as audience is saying.

The story is a plain story which doesn't add anything new and doesn't progresses like the original. The original showed a progress in the story from nothing to the origin of Joker but this part doesn't add anything new to it and just focuses on an event happening in his life.

The screenplay could have been more tight as making the movie musical imbalanced the screenplay, the direction was good and the performances were strong like the original.

Overall, it was a decent watch and you should atleast give it one try but it's not re-watchable."
6.0,6 October 2024,"Imagine you love a certain brand of chocolate, you genuinely think it's the best chocolate in the market. You wish for years the creators came up with an evolution of the chocolate, a slight variation just for fun sake's. The company finally announces a new product, marketing it in the same way with the same name but just a different subtitle (Say Snickers ""Almonds"" or Snickers ""Peanut butter"" or whatever). You excitedly go to buy the product, open up the wrapper and take a first bite. You feel your face start to melt when your brain understands you're not even eating a chocolate, it's some sort of terrible protein bar with mint flavor and a little line of chocolate fudge on top. That is exactly how I felt about this movie.

I don't care who is to blame here. If Todd Philips as a director for putting out this terrible scam, or execs for forcing him to do it. Either way, the bottom line is that it is ethically wrong to take a movie that developed such a strong identity, force it to be something entirely different, and then let a massive fanbase flock to theaters to experience this heartbreaking surprise. As a fan of a the first movie, I went right back to theaters for the second one, logically expecting to see a second part of the first movie. Not a movie about lady gaga with joker as a secondary character.

Cannot think of a worse scenario."

It's so bad, I cannot even describe the suffering and the sense of spending hours of my life on this garbage in vain. The story is just complete nonsense, the totally useless songs at random points of the movie give you the feeling that no matter what, they really needed to squeeze a fixed number of pre-written songs in the movie. The entire plot was completely irrational, even for a superhero-comic book adaptation, with lots of illogical things. Don't watch it under any circumstance!"

2.0,10 October 2024,"I thought the first one was awesome and was in every way possible in doubt when they said they were going to make sequel but giving the way the first movie performed I was not surprised.

Should they have made a sequel, after watching this atrocity, no they should have stayed well away.

Was there anything positive about this film, yes the start was great with a cartoon start, I thought that was good and of course who can forget Phoenix's performance, as always great but that's about it, oh and the ending was good. No I am not going to give anything away.

But the rest of it, awful.

The singing, don't get me started on that part, in all honesty, they ruined the movie doing it with musical numbers throughout the movie, it ruined the actual story of the film and ruined the tension this movie could have had.

If anyone was a fan of the first movie, please give this a miss you will be totally disappointed, I was."
1.0,1 October 2024,"The explosive chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga is the film's beating heart, elevating the story to an unparalleled artistic level.

Gaga's performance as Harley Quinn is revelatory. Her complex and multifaceted interpretation of the iconic villain is a show in itself, perfectly complementing Phoenix's intensity. The musical scenes, with both stars delivering powerful and emotional vocals, are moments of pure delight for fans.

The film explores themes of madness, toxic love, and societal collapse with a mastery that grips us from start to finish. Todd Phillips' direction is bold and visceral, creating an oppressive and claustrophobic atmosphere that intensifies the viewer's experience."
6.0,10 October 2024,
1.0,1 October 2024,"I'm very disappointed.

It's a very pretty movie with no story.

I was surprised over the beautiful shots of the city and eyes on the details.

It's a slow paced movie. I'm confused if we even got any further than the first movie.

It kinda felt like 40 small trailers stitched together.

A shot here. Cut. Black screen. And a new shot there. Repeat.....

The music sometimes felt a bit cliche.

And the musical parts was kinda bad. The style was like an Elvis show. But the songs wasn't that great. And it's okay but don't have what felt like an hour of bad singing.

It kinda felt like watching a badly made Wes Anderson movie. The way that the movie gave room for these musical performances to take place in a different time and place. But these performances are not well connected enough to justify there relevance for the movie.

There wasn't a lot of depths to the characters.

But Phoenix was great.

My first thought on my mind: it's nothing to celebrate.

My conclusion is that I found more joy watching 65. And that's a movie about a man and a little girl who screams for the full duration of that movie."
6.0,7 October 2024,"The film doesn't trust the audience to critically question the main character, so it portrays them as weak and passive, only reacting instead of taking action. Anyone expecting a good sequel to the socially critical masterpiece predecessor will be disappointed.

The film feels long because, in the end, it just retells the story of the first movie. The only positive aspects are once again good acting and truly beautiful set design and cinematography. It's truly a shame for all the fans who were wondering how the story would continue and rightfully had high expectations.

Lady Gaga's performance is good. You can tell she's giving it her all."
3.0,6 October 2024,"Coming from someone who really likes the first Joker, I have to say this movie was very disappointing which is a shame since I genuinely had hope for it after seeing the trailers, even with the fact that it was going to be a musical for some odd reason, I was willing to give this movie a chance. But after seeing the low reviews even before the movie fully came out, I felt a bit upset but unsurprised.

I could write a super long list on everything that is bad or just not good about this movie, especially the pointless musical moments, but it really needs to be seen to be believed since there are some people who seem to like this movie, but nothing they could say could defend this movie from being anywhere near great.

However all the negatives aside for the moment, I do think there are positive things about this film. It Is genuinely a very well made movie, the visuals are gorgeous, the score and editing I found to be fantastic, I did like the dark tone this movie had, similar to the first. There are also scenes in this that I thought were good. The performances were especially fantastic, even with the weak script that the actors had to work with, the performances, manly Joaquin Phoenix's performance felt oscar worthy. I wouldn't put this movie near the worst comic movie ever made because the movie at least felt unique.

I do have a lot more to say about this film but overall, Joker: Folie a Deux belongs on the long list of disappointing sequels.

Overall Score: 65/100."
7.0,4 October 2024,"Not artsy. Not creative. Not original. Just a waste of time & nothing more. Gaga should be embarrassed. I am for spending $30 on tickets. The whole movie gave off 'we have no clue where this is going and also we have no intention of making the authentic joker/harley story.' I'm so turned off by all of it. I don't think I'll ever be a fan of Gaga or phoenix ever again. There was no storyline, no character development, no background or explanation of events. The movie lacked just about everything a story needs to be successful. Really, you could listen to Gaga singing in the sower & get the same effect. Absolute disappointment."
1.0,8 October 2024,"This sequel is not what we expected but no way near as bad as they are making it out to be. For my taste there was too much singing and not enough story. The court scene could have been played out in a good hour.. more action after this please. The singing was just slowed the film down. So much potential lost.

Gaga was good.. not what was needed for this version of joker in my opinion. In fact the musical element just got annoying as the film progressed. I didn't mind some of the scenes with joker due to its nature of being in his head and a fantasy but less is more.

Brilliant acting throughout. Shame this will probably be the last we see of this universe."
8.0,2 October 2024,"Folly of a movie. The only reason they made this a musical is that otherwise, it would've been over under an hour and still, they couldn't fully commit to it. Phoenix and Gaga are spectacular with the material they've given. The direction is great combining the cinematography and music to give the film a pretty good pace considering nothing at all happens in the movie. It can't be called a full-on musical but the musical parts of the movie were the only thing that actually entertained me even though it was mostly pointless. And the writing is horrible in this movie.

I loved the first part and thought a lot of the criticisms it got were actually things that the movie treated pretty well and it was the political climate the reasoning for so much criticism. But here, all those criticisms are made a lot more valid. The way it tries to empathise and criticize its protagonist is so dumb, and it doesn't exactly seem like the same character from the first one the way a lot of decisions are made. Lady Gaga's character is written as a template serial killer lover and nothing more even though she tries her best. So, naming that character Harley Quinn is such a disservice considering the history of that character.

A lot of the movie takes place in a courtroom and jail. In both of these areas, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense. The cops and lawyers in this movie say and do things that don't make any sense considering what they actually want from doing it. The Joker says a lot of things that amount to nothing while in the first movie, all of his rants and comedy had a cinematic purpose.

Considering they went for a musical, the movie had a lot of chances to be a lot more than it is even with its nonsensical paper-thin plot but they don't commit to it. And ending the movie abruptly like that, when the previous scene would've been enough just to reduce the drama of that event is so dumb. I mean, this is supposed to be a musical and such a big thing is presented in such a bland way?

The choice to be a musical and the ending are supposed to be the polarizing aspects of the movie. But I enjoyed the musical aspect and the ending being so bland is more of the issue than the choice to do that considering how the rest of the movie went. Overall, it's technically well-made but has a weak script. It should've been utterly boring if not for the atmosphere that it sets for the movie. Nonetheless, such a bad sequel."
7.0,4 October 2024,"When you create a sequel to a movie that many maniacs out there call masterpiece and sacred for some reason, it's a very tough job. But when you decide to make it all about analizing and deconstructing the first movie and commenting on how people reacted to it, that's a very bold move, definitely worthy of my respect.

I love the idea for this movie, honestly, and it really has some delighting moments, but unfortunately in the end it's impossible to miss the fact that we're watching a Todd Phillips' film. This guy is just not capable of writing a really good, well-balanced and complicated script. Musical scenes, even though they're beatifully sang, feel very much out of nowhere and unnecessary. The whole court trial is a bad joke. And there are also a few plot wholes, of course.

Phoenix is great again, maybe even better than before, but his role is much less flashy, so people will appreciate it less. Gaga is also doing a great job, but she has much less to do, that she should. The whole movie obviously looks really good and the technical side does the job.

In the end, it's much more original and treats mental problems more seriously, but it's still a bit worse than the first movie. It's not a truly good film, while it could have been great."
3.0,7 October 2024,
4.0,11 October 2024,"Most overhated movie ever! Don't believe everything you see online. Truly a masterpiece. I went into this movie thinking it would suck, but it ended up being the best movie I have seen so far in 2024.

When I first heard about this movie, I saw a lot of negative reviews and harsh criticisms. Many people online seemed to really dislike it, and I almost decided to skip it because of their opinions. But I'm so glad I didn't let those reviews change my mind. This movie turned out to be a hidden gem, a true masterpiece that I enjoyed from start to finish.

I get why some people didn't like it. For example, a lot of complaints were about the musical parts. Some viewers thought there were too many musical scenes, which they found too much or distracting. I can see their point; maybe one or two musical scenes would have been enough to show the story's emotions and themes. In this way, I agree that a bit of moderation could have made the movie more enjoyable for a wider audience.

But, despite these complaints, the movie is so good in other ways that the musical scenes don't matter much. The storyline is gripping, with unexpected twists that keep you hooked. The characters are well-developed, The cinematography is amazing, with stunning visuals that make the movie even better.

What really makes this movie stand out is how it makes you feel so many different emotions. There were moments of suspense, and excitement, all perfectly mixed to create a rich and immersive story. The director's vision is clear and unique, All I have to say is, don't believe everything you see online. Go watch it for yourself; it's truly a masterpiece!"
7.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux just had its premiere, and I have never seen so many people at an opening night. The line stretched all the way outside. Expectations were sky-high, to say the least! But how did people leave the theater? Many walked out feeling confused, and that's understandable. The movie does something no one has ever seen before, and people certainly weren't ready for it.

At first, I was ready to harshly criticize it. But the more I thought about it, the more conflicted I became. There are two ways to interpret this movie/musical. One interpretation is that it failed. Failed to entertain the audience, failed to deliver what people wanted-especially for those expecting something similar to the first film. That's because Joker: Folie à Deux chooses the musical format to convey its message. Now, that's not inherently a bad thing. We've seen musicals that have done the exact opposite, like La La Land or Chicago. But here, even though the musical element is a core part of the movie, with Lady Gaga's inclusion promising a spectacular show, it falls short of delivering on that promise.

Gaga sings flawlessly, but it's not the Gaga we know. It's as if her larger-than-life persona has vanished. Meanwhile, most of the songs feel flat, not taking you anywhere, making you experience them as pauses in the story rather than moments of progression. Unfortunately, the story itself feels repetitive at times and doesn't quite hook you in. Additionally, the chemistry between Joker and Harley Quinn is not what you'd expect-it's weak. If the film had 3-4 fewer musical numbers (since some were genuinely worth keeping), we might be having a very different conversation. There are individual moments in the film that are brilliant, but they fail to connect with the rest, losing their impact within a broader, somewhat unpleasant whole.

At one point, Joker says to Harley, ""Stop singing,"" and I think the entire theater collectively agreed with him. But that's where the second interpretation of this movie comes in. With that line, it's as if Todd Phillips is winking at the audience, telling us, ""I know you're not having fun. I feel you. I'm not clueless; I know what I'm doing."" And what he's doing is as bold as it is necessary. He's creating a new reference point in art. He sacrifices the mainstream success of his film to make a statement and leave behind something that we might never see again.

Think about it-when will you ever see one of DC's darkest villains, the Joker, in a musical again, and not in some indie production but in a blockbuster? In short, Joker: Folie à Deux may fail as a blockbuster, as a film for everyone, as basic entertainment, but it succeeds in shaking up pop culture. It might very well go down in history as a bold, audacious piece of art that inspires future creators to break the norms.

Now that this movie exists, others can attempt to blend the most unlikely genres, hoping to create something extraordinary, a new hybrid. Joker: Folie à Deux certainly wasn't that, though. But the start has to come from somewhere. So, I rate it a 6/10 as a viewer because it could have been much better, even in the format it chose, but as an art lover, I tip my hat to it for what it may inspire in the future.

As for the ending, which many didn't like at all, for me, it was the entire movie :)"

3.0,7 October 2024,"Directed and co-written by Todd Phillips. A runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. With an R rating.

""Arthur Fleck,"" played by Joaquin Phoenix, is being held at ""Arkham Asylum"" awaiting trial for the heinous crimes he committed in the first film.

""Arthur's"" popularity is at its highest. His lawyer, ""Maryanne Stewart,"" played by Catherine Keener, is trying to get a responsible defense against the prosecutor, ""Harvey Dent,"" played by Harry Lawtey.

The guards in ""Arkham"" can be hit or miss, but correctional officer ""Jackie Sullivan,"" played by Brendan Gleeson, gets ""Arthur"" in a class where he meets fellow patient ""Lee Quinzel,"" played by Lady Gaga.

You watch as the trial of the century takes place in ""Gotham."" Along with how ""Arthur"" wrestles with a mix of emotions and his fandom. All while falling in love with ""Lee."" In this musically inspired sequel.

""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was a tease. It had the template for something magical. I mean, you saw the first film. But this one dropped the ball overall.

I'm not a huge steak eater. But I hear the true steak lovers say if you have a good steak, you don't need A1 sauce on it. The first film was a tomahawk; they just needed to cook it the same, maybe add some different sides. Instead, they added a crap ton of A1 sauce and drowned out the whole steak. You could taste how good the steak was in spots, but your taste buds would get thrown off by the mouthful of A1 sauce you were consuming.

I get it. Todd Phillips isn't following the comics per se. He made the first film about mental health. It was a unique and real take on a villain we all know. In this film, with Lady Gaga, I was so excited because she can act with the best of them. We saw how the first film ended, so I expected or at least wanted them to terrorize the city together.

Todd Phillips went in the exact opposite direction. I did not like his creative vision for this film. At all. When I heard it was a musical, I was confused. This just seemed like adding something unnecessary to an excellent film already.

Every time I got into what was going on, then a random musical number would appear. It got annoying. Some of the music went along with the flow, but others derailed the pace and feel of the scene. The acting was so good I wanted to see more, especially at pivotal moments. Just for me to constantly get something that didn't fit. It's a lot of music. Joaquin Phoenix can hold a note. But I just didn't think this film called for it.

If the first film is about becoming ""Joker,"" then this film is about returning to ""Arthur Fleck."" They had some really good ingredients in this film. You could tell they paid a pretty penny to film it. I didn't like the vision for ""Harley Quinn."" I mean ""Lee."" I liked them adding ""Harvey Dent."" He was a tool, by the way.

I'm not a huge musical fan. I still could appreciate some of the musical numbers. But you're alienating a huge chunk of your original fan base to make this move.

Overall, the acting is phenomenal; you just wish they focused more on that than the music. Joaquin said it was hard to film because losing weight was fine, but now adding all this dancing and singing makes it extremely hard to film.

Lady Gaga said she had to switch her singing voice up and sing with a completely different tone. You could tell, but her iconic sound still came out a couple of times.

It's not all bad, but it's far from great too. Mental health is a huge component of this film. It was still extremely deep. The music isn't bad; it just felt unnecessary. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably like this film.

By the very end, I expected any scene I loved to get ruined by a musical routine. I was over it and kind of down on how it ended. Todd Phillips had a masterpiece. If they were going to go so drastic then they should've done it the first film or just not do a second film. A decision I know they wish they could redo. Someone should have said, ""Hey, you know you don't have to add all this extra stuff, your meal is already delicious"". I give this film three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥.

8.0,3 October 2024,"Don't waste your time. For me, this is like a huge disrespect to the first one.

The movie doesn't follow a plot, doesn't have a character development, things happen without a reason. They just throw a bunch of songs and some forced romantic trope and literally butcher entirely the whole image we had of Joker.

What a downfall, there was no need of making this film if this is what you were gonna give us, a not-so-good fanfic.

Obviously the cinematography, color palette and soundtrack is amazing. And joaquin's performance is without a doubt excellent. Meanwhile, lady gaga lacks of giving personality to the character, for me, the worst harley adaptation.

Literally, it's just nonsense. The movie makes decisions that don't make any sense, and doesn't add up to anything constructed throughout the film.

3 stars for Joaquin actually accepting being on this film, other than that. This is the worst movie of the year so far."
6.0,4 October 2024,"This movie really didn't work and failed to capture the atmosphere of the first one. The first film had a powerful narrative and character dynamics that deeply affected the audience, but this sequel doesn't create the same impact. It feels as if the director and the team made this film just to get it done, without any passion or creative energy. Given the success of the first film, audiences would have expected more from this sequel. Unfortunately, everything I watched felt lacking and disappointing.

One of the biggest problems is the incredibly slow pace of the film. Of course, some films are deliberately slow to carefully build the story, but that approach doesn't work here. It takes far too long for the action to kick in, and in the meantime, the movie loses the audience. No matter how deep or interesting the story might be, if it drags on this slowly, viewers can easily lose patience. The first film had a rhythm that captured the audience's attention from start to finish, but this sequel struggles to maintain that rhythm. It feels as if the story and character development are unnecessarily prolonged. This doesn't make the film more engaging; instead, it turns it into a tedious experience.

If I weren't a fan of musicals and dance, I would have struggled to give this movie even a 50 out of 100. There are some nice musical elements in the film, and the dance scenes make it somewhat watchable. However, these elements are not enough to save the overall tone of the movie. Unfortunately, even these scenes aren't placed in a way that matches the pacing and rhythm of the story. A musical or dance scene should energize the audience, but in this film, even those scenes lose their effect.

The film's pace is incredibly slow, to the point where it's slower than what you would expect from a sequel. Usually, sequels pick up where the first film left off and speed up the action or plot progression. But here, it feels like everything that was built in the first film has been forgotten, and instead, it takes a step backward. In a movie that drags on this much, it's hard to keep the audience engaged. The story itself might be interesting, but when presented this slowly, it does nothing but lose the audience's interest.

On the other hand, casting Lady Gaga was a good choice. When I first heard about it, I thought it was a bit risky, but her performance surprised me. The emotional depth and charisma she brought to her character helped salvage the film to some extent. She managed to build a nice chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, and this is one of the film's strongest aspects. However, even this chemistry isn't enough to make up for the film's overall sluggishness and shortcomings. Gaga's performance is strong, but the disjointed script and pacing prevent her from truly shining.

As a sequel, one of this film's biggest failures is its inability to sustain the spirit and energy of the first movie. The dark atmosphere and deep character explorations that were so central to the first film are almost nonexistent here. Instead, we are given a more superficial narrative and storyline. This makes it harder for the audience to connect with the characters, leaving a sense of emptiness by the end of the film. This is especially disappointing for characters that were so well-developed in the first movie. As a viewer, I wanted to see the characters evolve, but this film doesn't deliver that.

In the end, this movie turned out to be a disappointing experience, one I had high expectations for. While there are some strengths, like the musical scenes and Lady Gaga's performance, overall, the movie falls short due to its slow pace, disorganized story, and inability to recapture the magic of the first film. If the pacing had been better managed and the story more focused, this film might have been much more successful. But as it stands, unfortunately, it falls far short of meeting the audience's expectations."
3.0,7 October 2024,"This is a slow court room musical and the music isn't good either. Nothing like the first movie at all. Half the people in the theater left and my wife and I were falling asleep because it just dragged on forever with boring slow musical numbers.

It's mainly just 2 sets. Either in the asylum or in court. Back and forth from one boring scene to another. I have AMC stubs and pay monthly to see 3 movies a week and I find that because I'm not paying per movie, I'll see a lot more movies that I wouldnt see otherwise and can appreciate all sorts of films, but we couldn't appreciate this one at all and that RARELY happens for us.

We were both very excited for the sequel, but this was a major disappointment. Even after hearing it was a musical we were excited because we love them! This was different though. We couldn't wait for each song to be over so we could see more of the story. Nothing ever really happened though."
4.0,4 October 2024,"To cut a long story short: ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is not enjoyable - but it's not meant to be. It's dull, dreary, dark but not in a fun or exciting way - which is exactly what the film is trying to accomplish. ""Joker 2"" does its best and largely succeeds in undermining and deconstructing the first film, denying us any kind of cathartic pleasure at seeing Arthur strike back at society. There is little joker in this film, and the little there is is meant to be underwhelming and rather sordid. Arthur is just a pathetic, deluded psychopath who has been and is being abused (don't misunderstand me though: there clearly is sympathy for him throughout the film). There is absolutely nothing glamorous about him, and the sex scene with Quinn is like the whole movie: sad and vaguely repulsive.

We audiencemembers are Harley Quinn (and the audience at the trial): we admire Joker, his misdeeds and madness, or at least the fiction spectacle of it (she is a fan of a TV movie they made about him), but we don't really care about little, sad Arthur and his psychological problems. Like her, we want to see Joker, not Arthur. We want spectacle, we want to be entertained, watching a talk show that will end with a live murder. The movie largely denies us this pleasure, settling instead for a sombre, sad prison and courtroom drama. You want the guards to be punished - and it never happens. You want society to get its comeuppance - and it never happens. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is in reality a long anti-climax, teasing but never delivering Arthur in full Joker mode. The title refers to Harley Quinn, but it also is about Arthur and his shadow, his psychopathic double - not Joker per se, but his mental illness.

""Joker 2"" purposefully destroys the legacy of the first film and thus any possible suspicion of indulgence for violence and crime as a pleasurable spectacle and for criminals even as anti-heroes. Seen that way, ""Joker 2"" is a great film, a brave endeavor by Todd Philips, who could easily have given audiences what they craved. Instead, he gave them what they need - a reality check."
7.0,10 October 2024,"Have you ever danced alone in a room, guided by music coming exclusively from your head, or read a book that broadened your horizons, disturbed your previous convictions, forced you to change? Have you ever looked into someone's eyes so deeply, felt someone else's soul and the infinity of existence in those pupils? Have you been consumed? If your answer is no, it's obvious why this movie is not for you. Mediocre thinking has led you to the conclusion that a villain must have a hero to fight against. This movie is NOT about ""good"" and ""bad"" guys and how a superhero will defeat a sick psychopath. The fight is solely within ourselves, us against the shadow that we were and that we can become. What is the biggest driver for fighting with ourselves, with the anxieties that the world burdens us with, where to find the right motive valuable enough so that every time we ""wipe the floor"" , we get up again ready for another round. Money, fame, recognition, beauty, power? The answer is precisely in every aspect, the words and songs of our ""hero"" Arthur Fleck and Harley. That's love. And what is the closest way to feel the storm of euphoria when you are next to someone you love, than through a musical symphony. Tracks such as ""Get Happy"", ""To Love Somebody"", ""Gonna Build A Mountain"" and of course ""That's Life"" performed by Lady Gaga perfectly approximated the ""crazy romance"" and constant Arthur Fleck's fight with his, I believe, alter ego in the form of the Joker. The fact that we were watching an ordinary man, no super villain, is confirmed by his reaction when he was finally able to embrace his role as the Joker. He felt power, support, belonging, and despite everything, he finally became interesting and funny to someone, but he chose none of that, but to heal the absence of love that he never really had. Which shows us another reason why people didn't like this movie. They expected a crazy killer who stomps people with his club and gets a prelude to his villainous era, while they got a vulnerable, unstable and in love man, who would like to take off the mask and be who he is, and that is hurt. Of course, the broad dullness of the masses through social networks made it impossible to give a chance to anything that does not immediately and constantly hold their attention, alienation from emotion, listening to superficial and generic music and finally the inability to understand any artistic metaphor led to the fact that the film it turns out to be a ""flop"".

To conclude, the film is solid, interesting with minor problems with ""pacing"". It has strong emotion, satisfying acting and a perfect ending. The ""failed"" fate of this film reinforced the whole point of the film, which is that people don't understand madness or any more abstract emotion and condemn anything that is different from what is widely represented and trendy. Joker ""Folie a Deux"" gave everyone the opportunity to step out of their comfort zone, some did it, while some, unfortunately, remained cocooned."
5.0,2 October 2024,"Seriously if you just want to listen to some songs being sung without any story line it is movie for you, in the middle pf the movie I have almost fallen asleep, just feels like there was nothing to show so they just tried to extend the movie with singing... Compared to first part this film is really poor... Story line is not existent it does not really attract attention.

I had really high hopes when they announced second part of the movie, but unfortunately there expectations were not met..

It is basically 60 min of singing 60 min of court and 18 minutes of story, seriously way worse than expected, if you expect similar movie to first part better do not go.."

7.0,5 October 2024,"I came into this film expecting the reviews to be wrong. The first film was an excellent description of the joker and his complex mind and I felt that the producers could live up to the climax of maintaining the quality of the old film but even build on it and make it better.

However after a dragged out 2 hours and 18 minutes,which could have been shortened by a lot, I realised that the film was a no going col-de- sac of pointless songs and pointless characters. The role of Harley Quinn was portrayed and poorly played by lady gaga. The highly rated actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a poorly written script which although he played well it ultimately led to a poor film which I would not recommend.

In conclusion I felt this film was a poor sequel due to the fact that Turning a film about a phychotic lunatic which made a great first film into a musical which went nowhere and proved to be heavily disappointing should never have been done to the joker series. Even though the joker is a laughing lunatic he does not sing his heart out in a film about him as the two films have parallel opposite genres which I feel shouldn't be done I would not recommend this film for any Joker lovers who expect this to be good and also cannot stress enough to people to not go into this movie expecting it to be good as it will be drastically disappointing to you."

9.0,8 October 2024,"The visuals were OK, but this was so bad. I almost felt like they did it on purpose to troll us and it backfired. I actually liked Morbius better because at least it had an interesting story. The only thing this had was visuals don't waste your money.

I have a feeling this might go down as one of the biggest flops in movie history people will make videos and book reports about how you go from a nine out of 10 movie to a two out of 10 movie sequel The runtime is way too long with the trailers near there almost 3 hours. I don't care about my money. I care about that. I wasted three hours of my life. That I can't get back."
7.0,6 October 2024,"To be honest, I only watched Joker 1 because of the reviews people were given for Joker 2, and I wanted to see why people were upset.

Author Fleck in the first movie was a mentally ill man who even though he kills six people he exposes the hard life people in Gotham City deal with and how they largely have no chance of living good lives. It's understandable, personally the Joker character is not my type, but it was a good watch.

Author is now in prison and is on trial for his murders - did he commit his crimes due to insanity (multiple personality disorder) or did he act with a sound mind and should be executed. Okay simple enough story and personally would have enjoyed a story where they sat in the court for the whole 2 hours discussing the matter similar to how the 12 Angry Men (1957) was directed however they went another way.

Before Author attends court, he meets Lee Quinzel, who claimed she had been abused and was put in a mental prison by her crazy mother, they bond over this and make plans that once Author is out, they will live a good life not worrying about the craziness around them. Again, I would have been fine with this even though I could not care less about a love interest, and I seriously don't understand how she truly fits into the story. Lee Quinzel is comparable to tumble girl crazy - had a good upbringing, has a good life but wants something exciting and thus wants to be around actual hard-on-their-luck people to feel like them and be them. Which is why I don't like her; her insertion does not completely flow unless we are looking at an angle of the rich wanting to cosplay the poor or exploit them.

Which brings in another part the singing, why was there singing I don't know. Yes, Author liked music however it wasn't necessarily a big part of Joker 1, mainly it was the song ""that life..."" which was used as an emphasis on his horrible life (and for him to dance around - which made him look free in Joker 1) but in this movie, singing is seemingly an integral part like it a musical however it misses a point in that during a musical number we move from scene to scene the songs flow into the next scene - they essentially take out the dialogue and replace it with singing and it transitions (whilst explaining) to a different scene. But here they talked about something and then sang the about same thing and stayed in the same scene PLUS they often sang the ""same songs"" (songs that had the same idea all the time - so it became annoying and repetitive). So yeah, singing was completely unnecessary and did not match the tone of the movie.

And then the ending - okay interesting but I kind of did not care after watching 2 hours of everything else.

Overall, I did not like the movie. The acting was good, everybody did their job. The singing from Lady Gaga was good (of course) but I did not care for the Author's singing. I do not know what I was expecting but possibly Author working on his comedic material and acquiring a better community inside prison. Or maybe replace Lee Quinzel with Ricky where Ricky does not look up to Joker and rehabilitate together or something because he kept showing up but nothing much to his character.

I do like the fact he was made into a ""normal person"" as I do feel like some people overly interpreted Author in the first movie as their hero who stood up against ""the big dogs"" where in reality even though he did do that; he did it because he was being provoked or abused, the man is the definition of what happens when social services don't do their job or funding is cut. He was not a Giga Chad."
1.0,8 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is perhaps the most textbook example to date of a film being less than the sum of its parts; it dances with very compelling ideas and themes, it bolsters incredible performances by an all-star cast, it is just as hauntingly beautiful in its cinematography as the first film, and the basic story premise is a compelling iteration upon the prior film at first glance. But alas, the ultimate assembly of this sequel in the form of the film we end up watching could not be any more disappointing and misguided. This movie is such a plodding, dull, unengaging, and boring viewing experience that lacks even the most basic fundamentals of cinematic pulse.

I am in awe that a film of this scale with so much talent behind it could be squandered so severely. Part of me begins to wander if a superior edit of this film could exist, but it is useless to dwell on such what-ifs when the director himself affirms that this version of the film is his complete vision. An oddly large number of viewers do applaud this film based solely on the merit of what it attempts instead of what it actually achieves; to that, I say, if films were weighed based on their intent instead of their execution, then Tommy Wiseau's The Room would be an objective masterpiece instead of an ironic one."
3.0,10 October 2024,"This is a great piece of cinema and is very misunderstood at the moment. Very well written and is not a campy fan service movie. I appreciate that the movie was much more than what everyone thinks they know the Joker to be. It's a refreshing take on the true madness of the character. It brings to life what someone like the Joker would actually be experiencing and gives an honest voice to mental illness. To enjoy this, you have to listen to the dialog and move past the fact that there is music involved. The music is very intentional and tells so much about the story. It's a shame all of the incels that dress up as the Joker for Halloween every year are trashing this movie. Set design is great, still giving off the strong NY 70's vibe. Joaquin and Gaga work well on screen together. This movie is deep and every bit as good as the first. A film ahead of its time for sure."
2.0,13 October 2024,This movie was nowhere near as bad as everyone says. It could also be redeemed with a follow up. I wont mention any spoiler here. But his relationship with Harley should be resolved and he should be alive so to speak on another film. You could have a golden trilogy. If we don't get a third one. Than this movie is pointless and sucks so bad. That ending could have saved the day. I mean come the f on we start cooking and you just blow the whole things to crap. There was never any saving grace for this movies Except the ending and everyone got excited and you just blow your wad to soon. It's shameful like no one even bothered looking at a script. Shameful. Needed an impactful ending which we never seen.

6.0,6 October 2024,"If you have waited patiently for a physiological drama then you'll disappointed. Despite a seriously good score, I don't understand why direction is taking us down a musical, surely Phillips is not suggesting this has always been inside Arthur's soul.

Set two years after the live on air murder, Arthur is awaiting his trial and finds solice in an avid fan and finds true love. One thing for sure the acting is once again faultless, whether he (Pheonix) wins again is a matter of opnion. Lady Gaga is solid as Harley and gave her a more sultry demeanour, then her predecessor.

There are times again like the first you are almost cheering the anti hero and that's a testament to Pheonix and his performance. Script and storytelling wise it does fall flat as it really doesn't move forward. Set soley pretty much in the prison and courtroom it seems its rehashing the inner demons of Arthur which we already are aware of.

Also Folie A Duex is almost lost in its meaning as it seems only an after thought. It's not as bad as people are saying, it's just frustrating."
1.0,4 October 2024,"This just didn't do it for me

Joker returns! We start off with Arthur in Arkham who seems to have taken a step back from the ""Joker"" and is quieter, that is until he meets Harley days before his trial. She is obsessed with the joker, not so much Arthur. The movie takes action as Arthur must stand trial for the crimes he committed in the last movie.

It's not that entertaining unfortunately. I feel like the whole arc of him kind of goes nowhere, the pacing is quite strange because I thought it started out quite strong but slowly faded. The court room isn't that entertaining bar Puddles on the stand.

This is definitely a movie of good scenes over a good movie, didn't like the singing aspects after the first 30-40 minutes just want my cup of tea.

The movie was shot really well, looks very good and the soundtrack is okay.

Nothing else more to say I don't want to just slam it, 5/10."

7.0,10 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is quite possibly the worst dumpster fire ever to grace the big screen. It took the brilliance of the first film, threw it in Arkham, and set the asylum on fire. The idea of turning the Joker's dark descent into a twisted love story musical is as jarring as it is ridiculous. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's singing feels more like nails on a chalkboard than any kind of entertainment. The plot? A nonsensical parade of random musical numbers that destroy any sense of pacing. This movie should come with a warning: If you liked the first Joker, Folie à Deux will ruin it for you. Save yourself the two hours and do literally anything else."
1.0,12 October 2024,"Joker is a spectacular and standout film that needed no follow up. This movies main failure is is inability to separate itself from the first. This movie is beautiful, well written, and tragic; rather than the making of the joker, this is his undoing. If you watch this and said nothing new was taught to you about Arthur Fleck, you have poor media literacy.

Music mostly focusing on the grit of the leads voices contrasted against the sheer power of their fantasized counterparts. It sounds stunning and allows Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix's excellent camera presence to shine. This music, along with the various styles the cinematography takes on, tells a story of unstable illness between two people deluded in fantasy. It's new and fresh and very Joker."
1.0,5 October 2024,"This movie was probably the worst one I'll see this year , the whole movie was all about court and no action.

The whole movie went from a masterpiece to a musicall all because of lady gaga.

Singing and smoking was the whole context he only person I liked was the tiny short guy appearing in court. DEFIENTLY A BAD MOVIE.

I wanted more action and there was like no plot , it did show his madness pretty well it explained alot of how he was crazy and why he turned out to be crazy , they should definitely delete this movie from all platforms.

Lady gaga was probably the whole reason the movie turned out bad because she wanted it to be a musical."
7.0,4 October 2024,"I'm baffled by the negative reception this incredible film has received. It's truly a remarkable piece of cinema. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver performances that are nothing short of exceptional, and the cinematography is visually stunning. The camera movements and composition are also amazing, adding to the film's overall brilliance. The soundtrack and sound design are equally impressive.

A special praise goes to Todd Phillips for taking bold risks and reminding us what cinema should be-an art form. His direction takes us back to a time when films were crafted with passion, depth, and artistry. I find it hard to understand the criticism of the script-it's far from weak. The story is intricate, filled with depth and layers that demand attention. This is a film that will stand the test of time and serve as inspiration for future filmmakers."

6.0,8 October 2024,"A weak story, very bad fallow up! I had great expectations, thought the movie was going to push forward in the direction it left off. Unfortunately it's was a huge disappointment, I was bored and I am seldom bored. The movie turned into a musical, and it just didn't fit.. Some singing would have been fine, but turning the movie completely into a musical was a very bad decision.

The only thing that didn't disappoint was the performance of the actors, both of them did a great job! Love both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.

Another thing, it seemed as they left the door open for a new story/sequel, but to be honest after what the writers did to this movie, I don't think I would watch it. Joaquin is the star period!"
1.0,8 October 2024,"Joker was an actual good movie, so a sequel was pretty much in the books, but yeah, Lady Gaga was involved and it had to be a musical, with that in mind I knew I wasn't going to like it but would still go out of my way to see it.

That was the easiest 12$ any movie theater made out because as expected, the movie was a garbage musical....it had zero action, then music, then zero action. To put in perspective, think of the worst movie from DC? Was it green lantern? Not anymore!

If you want to waste some money and 2+ hours in the movie theater, it's perfect for you. There was no mention of Batman, no 2face... sleep and you'll be better off."
7.0,3 October 2024,"Watched the movie on day it came out, not spoilering myself with any criticism or rating beforehand. Well ... kind of a mistake. Really loved the first part and I knew that some musical aspects where involved here, but was not prepared for a whole ""musical"" (taking into account that producers denied this to be a musical in first place) . The style neither fits in the overall lore nor does it do the weak story any good, it went straight strongly annoying after the third song. Regarding the story the script is super weak and without spoiling any big parts (wouldn't be a loss though), it mashes all the good the prequel has build up directly in the dirt. To conclude I wished I could undo watching the second part of Joker and just leave the first movie with an open ending in my mind."
1.0,6 October 2024,"Let me start by saying I wasn't all that impressed with Phillips' original Joker movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it seemed quite simply like Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke smashed together. Not wholly original, and I came away wondering whether the Joker character really needs a backstory or justification for existing. I mean, isn't the lack of a backstory what made Heath Ledger's portrayal in the Dark Knight so appealing? The enigmatic agent of chaos who just wanted to watch the world burn - for no apparent reason? Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal, while skilfully done, was clearly not that Joker, nor was he meant to be.

Yet somehow, it's as if the audience of Joker: Folie à Deux didn't get the memo on that. It seems like many original Joker fans, somewhat bewilderingly, expected this movie to be his glorious transformation into the criminal mastermind who would go on to be Batman's arch nemesis. If you haven't yet seen the sequel, and that's what you expect, you will be disappointed. But ask yourself - would that even make sense? At what point in the original did you believe Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to be a criminal mastermind, who could competently stay several steps ahead of a well-educated billionaire vigilante who's described as 'the world's greatest detective'?

This movie is fine. It's not brilliant, and it's not awful. The musical numbers go on quite a bit and don't really add anything meaningful to the story. But I think it's a real shame for people to totally misunderstand the Joker character being set up in the first movie, and then hate on the sequel for not making him an inconsistent mess. When you read other reviews claiming there is no character development - what they mean is they didn't get the character development they wanted. Owning up to ones crimes and reconnecting with ones humanity IS character development. Realising that a need for love and connection in a brutally uncaring world has driven you to pretend to be someone you're not and led to even more division, destruction and brutality IS character development.

People will probably hate this review for pointing that out, and that's fine. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But at least be honest about your reasons for having those opinions."
10.0,5 October 2024,"What an utter disappointment this was. The makers of this film have completely forgotten what made the first one so good. It's as though this movie was a punishment for the audience for liking a character like arthur fleck.

Just don't watch it! It ruined everything the first part stood for. The musical part completely annoyed me and almost made me fall asleep.

This movie shouldn't even get one star.

I don't know which was more annoying the wait for the grand reveal that would never come or the annoying short Bursts of dance and music.

Harley Quinn as a character turned out to be a disappointment.

Above all what I'm sad about the most is the lost potential."
7.0,11 October 2024,"I saw it on opening night, and I wanted to take some time to reflect and ponder it. I'll start by saying that musicals aren't really my thing, but I knew going in that this would be one. The musical segments didn't detract from the story, but it did feel like one or two of them started a bit prematurely. I understand that these scenes represent Arthur's imagination, so it makes sense that they might begin at odd moments. Still, the viewer's experience needs to be taken into consideration.

When I first walked out of the theater, I was thinking, ""What did I just watch?"" But after giving it more thought and reflecting on the scenes and how they build up, the full picture becomes clearer, and you start to appreciate it more. As expected, the acting was incredible, and the cinematography and color grading were outstanding. However, I do feel like Lady Gaga was underutilized. It's not that she lacked screen time, but I think her character could have been explored more deeply.

The deeper dive into Arthur's backstory was a nice touch, offering more context to his character. Despite some of the criticism, I believe it's better than many people give it credit for, though it doesn't quite reach the perfection of the first film. My perspective on the movie changed after it was over, especially as I reflected on it later. Reading more about the ending and seeing other people's interpretations helped me appreciate it even further.

If you take the time to analyze the film beyond the surface level, you can really see and appreciate what Todd Phillips was aiming for. That said, I think the criticisms are valid. There are two sides to every coin, and it's important to consider both to get the full picture.

In the end, while it was an unnecessary sequel, I think it was pretty decent. It fails to meet expectation's, but it still holds up in its own way."
3.0,5 October 2024,"To me this is worst than the room in all the bad ways.i don't know how this man got an Oscar. Why was it even put in theatres. Big stain on everyone involved careers .

To call it a film would be generous-it's more of a disjointed, pretentious mess disguised as something profound. The pacing is unbearable, like it's trying so hard to stretch its shallow material over a bloated runtime, all while pretending it has something deep to say. The script is an incoherent mix of clichés and empty provocations, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by someone who just discovered edgy internet forums.

Joaquin Phoenix's performance, while praised by many, felt like nothing more than a series of exaggerated facial contortions and tics without any real depth behind them. It was more about spectacle than substance, and it's baffling that this one-dimensional portrayal was awarded with an Oscar. The film's attempt at psychological exploration is laughably superficial, and its forced edginess comes off as desperate.

As for the direction, it feels like Todd Phillips was trying to mimic better filmmakers but missed the mark entirely. The tone is all over the place, and the cinematography, which some have praised, feels more like a cheap imitation of Scorsese's style. The whole thing reeks of self-importance without any justification for it.

It's a film that mistakes being grim and joyless for being meaningful. The fact that it made it to theaters, let alone received critical acclaim, says more about the current state of Hollywood than the actual quality of this movie. Every person involved should seriously reconsider their creative choices."
2.0,2 October 2024,"Joker Folie à Deux is refusing to give the audience what they crave almost on every corner. A good thing, in my opinion, in these times of instant gratification. The audience has to face the music on this one. Phillips didn't take the easy way like the trailers suggested. I was worried about fanservice and a rehash of the previous film. Although the movie does use small glimpses of flashbacks/glimpses from the previous movie, which wasn't really necessary in my opinion.

Cinematography, acting performances and music score is again top level. And it feels tonally a little bit different from the first one, more introspective. It's stripping off all the flashy parts; with the exception of two musical numbers this is a very subdued experience. It focuses more on the psychology and duality of our titular character. Arthur Fleck is both a victim and a perpetrator and therefore creates division not only among the people in Gotham but also in himself. Which undoubtedly strikes similarities to our current celebrity obsessed society. Arthur is battling for his soul and I commend such ambition in film making. The movie strays even further from the roots of the comic version which will further alienate most comic book fans. Right after the end credits rolled, I knew this isn't a movie that will be accepted by general audiences. It's one of those movies that rewards a second viewing. There is a lot of thought put into it, to the extent that even the musical concept isn't a gimmick. Without it, it would be too grim and depressing. The levity it brings is needed for it's a hard pill to swallow. Besides the first movie had it's fair share of music an dance scenes in retrospect. The music also stands for the siren's call personified in Lee Quinn who is trying to lure out the Joker. The movie has a lot more clarity what it wants to say than it's predecessor.

The movie shines with lots of little details like the judge bearing a striking similarity to a famous director who inspired the first Joker movie. Arthur has to dream up realities because he is trapped in a recurring nightmare, notice how the three guards who torment him bear a striking similarity to the bullies he encountered in the subway. Details like these are what make movies enjoyable even on re-watch.

Which isn't to say that the movie is flawless. It certainly drags a bit in the middle and could have been a bit tighter in terms of running time. And it is unfortunately not as radical as a Michael Haneke film, although it has undertones of Funny Games in it. Similar like the first movie it shies away to lean into the complicity of news & entertainment media even though it seemingly takes place during a time when smart phones and other social media driven gadgets didn't exist. But it has definitely guts right till the very end and is overall more thought-provoking than The Joker. It even fixes certain problems I had with the muddled themes of it's predecessor. The downside is that it definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea, and that was very clear from the audience reactions in the cinema. For example when a recurring character is asked to come to the stand during a trial. The audience was mostly giggling and laughing at this one although it wasn't intended to, but it exposed the people in the audience who thought this would be a spectacular roller-coaster ride. It is a great tragedy. The biggest irony here is that the most vocal critics are the ones who want more of the same-old comic book Joker, not knowing that almost all superhero comic books & it's characters are derivedfrom greek tragedies. And this movie does more justice to those ancient tales than the version the audience craves for. It is sad how the reaction of the audience in real life resembles the citizens of Gotham at the last act, probably unintended by the filmmakers but still very meta. Folie À Deux leaves a more lasting impression than The Joker, since audiences have to engage in the themes in order to get enjoyment out of it. And that is a quality we don't see very often in high budgeted films anymore. I enjoyed it till the very end and unlike most people it absolutely elevated the previous film.

8/10."

1.0,4 October 2024,"I really wanted to see what's happened to Joker after he got caught and how his character developed, Lady Gaga also seemed like an interesting addition to the story as Harley Quinn. Everything went wrong. It felt soulless and cashgrabby. I went back home after watching half of this... musical? How on earth did they come up with such idea? As someone else here said: the only clown there was me waiting several years for this movie release, not Joker. I felt the same way. I want this meaningless trend on sequels to get more money to end. There are so many original ideas out there! Bring those ideas to life and people will pay to see them."
6.0,11 October 2024,"This movie was a JOKE. It lacked everything that makes a movie enjoyable. Two hours and $12 that I'll never get back. I don't remember being more disappointed in a sequel, in my life. While Phoenix and GaGa were solid, the movie offered NOTHING of substance. I thought the first movie provided a great base to work with, but it was a total miss. I heard and read all the reviews, but I had to find out for myself. Well, anyone who rates this movie more than a 2/10........certainly had a part in making it. DO NOT waste your money on this disaster. Stay home and clean your bathroom with a toothbrush........you'll have more fun."
3.0,11 October 2024,"The film can be put into two parts, the good and the bad, first half being the bad part and second part being pretty damn great.

The first hour is very slow and confusing, not much energy put into it and you start becoming very confused about who this was made for and what kind of drugs certain people involved were on. The singing felt very out of place at first and was not that impressive. I think the biggest problem by far was that the first part was terribly edited, I legit do believe you can make a pretty great film out of this mess if you made certain scenes longer and completely changed the cuts. Hopefully deleted scenes will be released, maybe there's something out of value that was left out. Hell maybe I should edit it myself. If the film studio is reading this, I'm your guy. Pull the film from theaters, let me work on it and then it will become the big hit it was meant to be.

I only watched the first 40 minutes and then took a break for a couple of days and finished the movie now. I can't remember if I was high or drunk when watching the first 40 minutes but it didn't make it better.

Anyway almost directly after you reach the 1 hour mark things starts getting intresting, the film got some life and energy to it. Scenes went from being very boring and confusing to being fun and meaningful. Some mismatches were still made but overall there was a lot more to like then dislike and even the second half can become a lot greater with editing.

The Singing, akward dialoge, The very weird narrative will not make any sense for normies, It's too deep for them to ever be able to understand the genius behind it. The film choses to show Arthur's broken mind not in third person, but within the filmmaking itself. It's pure representation of trauma and extreme mental problems. That's why normies can't understand any of it, because they do not understand at all the mind of a person like Arthur, This film boldly goes way deeper then the first film, who had only scratched the surface.

The last 15 minutes was dissapointing but amazing at the same time."
7.0,8 October 2024,"As a highly anticipated sequel to the groundbreaking ""Joker,"" ""Joker 2"" falls short in delivering the same level of impact and brilliance that its predecessor achieved. While the original film captured the essence of the iconic character in a fresh and compelling way, the sequel struggles to find its footing and lacks the depth and complexity that made the first film so memorable.

One of the key issues with ""Joker 2"" is its reliance on shock value and gratuitous violence, rather than exploring the character's psychological depth and societal commentary as effectively as the first film did. The sequel feels more like a superficial attempt to replicate the success of the original, rather than offering a meaningful continuation of the story.

Furthermore, the performances in ""Joker 2"" lack the raw emotional power that Joaquin Phoenix brought to the role in the first film. The character development feels shallow and forced, with the protagonist's descent into madness coming across as contrived rather than organic.

In terms of narrative structure, ""Joker 2"" feels disjointed and unfocused, with subplots that fail to connect in a meaningful way. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull exposition followed by rushed and chaotic sequences that lack coherence.

Overall, ""Joker 2"" fails to capture the magic of the original film, instead succumbing to clichés and missed opportunities. While there are moments of visual flair and stylistic bravado, they cannot save the film from its lackluster storytelling and uninspired direction.

In conclusion, ""Joker 2"" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. It lacks the depth, nuance, and emotional resonance that made the original ""Joker"" a modern masterpiece, ultimately falling flat in its attempt to recapture the lightning in a bottle that made the first film so unforgettable."
2.0,6 October 2024,"Joker's not dangerous enough, Gotham's not messed up enough, Dent's way too wooden, young & irrelevant, Lady Gaga's (& any woman's in general) lip job was a very bad decision (apart from an unmatchably good voice, she has good acting skills & really super cute in A Star is Born)...this is a movie made with heart & a good amount of effort's gone into it. Yes, we would've liked to have a greater level of violence & Joker mannerisms strictly adhering to DC depictions to have shined but it is not all that bad as the critics & other viewers make it out to be. Still worth a single watch at the cinemas!"
10.0,9 October 2024,"A musical movie of the joker was really not what I or any other people who were fans of the First joker movie expected. It was just an full blast of disappointment. Nothing really grabbed my attention, it started in the middle of nowhere, half of the movie was just court. It felt like a cash grab movie, because it didn't even feel necessary, after such a good first movie, winning awards. Even tho it took so much time, it felt rushed not thought thru and no good concept. No action. No comedy. No good attention grabbing scenes that make you think. The only thing I thought about after leaving the cinema is that I wasted my time."
7.0,7 October 2024,"I had high hopes for this movie. There were some scenes that seemed so random. Some random parts I liked and some I did not. I did not expect an animated opening sequence, which I thought seemed charming. I'm also surprised at that one scene where he represents himself as a lawyer and the court allowed it. It seems that the Joker was indecisive on who he should be, either as a drab loner or as a charming killer clown. To be honest, I liked the Joker persona. Also, I heard it was a musical but I did not expect the numbers to be licensed music, like Rat Pack music. I liked hearing Lady Gaga singing ""They Long to Be Close to You"" and ""That's Life!"" I had high hopes for the movie because I love both Lady Gaga and Harley Quinn, but I did not like how he was barely involved and she just ditched him in the end. I also hated the ending where an inmate/patient decided to give Joker ""what he bleeping deserved."" All in all, I loved the musical numbers and the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, but I hated the character development and the ending."
2.0,6 October 2024,"Worst movie... Nothing made sense in the movie... And Lady Gaga is the worst Harley... Every song in the movie dragged the movie to hell... They tried to make it a masterpiece, but ruined the storyline.... Joker's uncontrollable laugh is also missing... Made me rethink that Joker 1 was a hit movie by chance.... The movie just got lucky.... Joker 2 has no depth in it.... Everything thing looked fake.. even the courtroom..... I hope they don't they part 3 out of it .... There was no need of this sequel... Its a flat movie ....... ......At last i want to say, Heath Ledger joker is the best one..."
4.0,7 October 2024,"Ij what parallel universe is THIS film considered bad and The Substance being praised?

It is SO well done. The singing aspect is his delusion with Harley. It's how we get to see their characters in their minds view of themselves. It is clever in the songs choices and the difference between the real people and the Joker and Harley Quinn.

You feel sorry for Arthur. You understand him more than any portrayal of this character has given us.

How are people not understanding and appreciating this story and the acting is beyond me.

It is insightful, gritty, beautiful, sad, hopeful, and it shows the ugly side of humanity. That we want headlines and not details."
7.0,19 October 2024,"I watched the film, what can I say, it's far from the first part, but I really liked the prison scenes, but I would add more brutality and harshness, some scenes with attempted rape or suicide like in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the ending, I really liked the ending, I would add it to the end of Part 1 of the film and it would be a super mega film, Phoenix played just great, no worse than in Part 1, for which he has great respect, Lady Gaga is also at her best, I will also note the performance of Brendan Gleeson as the head of the prison guards, a very caloric charismatic character, I really liked his performance. I didn't like the music, there are a lot of songs, it seems that the director stuck a lot of unnecessary and incomprehensible musical scenes into the film, but overall I really liked the film, so I advise everyone to watch it."
1.0,3 October 2024,The story of the movie moves so slowly with no direction. Story somewhere in between start to build up but then it will go to to zero. Where have they used this much money only two places shown courtroom and jail. Looks like the focussed on getting Oscar rather making money that people will actually enjoy. Joker can have so much range which was shown in first part but here it looks confined. Only thing that makes this movie barely watchable is Joaquin Phoenix's acting and cinematography. It's so boring and songs in the movie deliberately shoved that even joker said in the end to stop singing 😂. If you still haven't watched please don't.
6.0,5 October 2024,
5.0,11 October 2024,"Folie à Deux is not so much a double madness as it is a madness reversal.

The success of the first Joker lies in the fact that its dark representations and interpretations profoundly elicit the dark side of the public's heart. When people see their dark side, fear and have to face it. The Joker is the best point of expression, even its dark influence far beyond the director and the main actor's expression. Then the subsequent fear has to be saved and glorified by the director and production attempts.

Although it is said to be a double madness, it is actually the first step after the Joker's madness controls Arthur, the director wants the second madness to be Arthur controlling the Joker back. But the director and production underestimated the reality of the darkness. This attempt to return to social normality was not accepted.

Or the viewers who came to watch Joker 2 to challenge their values by making it even darker were forced to go back and watch the reversal. It's madness on the part of the director, but it wasn't accepted.

What I saw was the director and producer's fear and redemption of the impact and deep darkness of the first movie."
7.0,14 October 2024,"Forget all the 5* reviews, they are obviously written by the studio, distributors or anyone else financially involved in this monstrosity.

It's awful. Like, as bad as it gets. Imagine watching Shutter Island but instead of dialogue you have a 'jazz hands' song and dance routine in every scene. Literally.

The true study of madness would be dissecting the filmakers brains to try and discover what had possessed them to turn a brilliant first Joker film into a musical. This has to be up there with the top 10 worst films of all time. Not so bad its good, just infuriatingly bad.

Also very confusing how this got to the greenlight stage considering how many people have to sign off on a $200million budget.

Oh to be a fly on the wall in those initial test screenings..

There is nothing about this film you will enjoy as a fan of cinema, comic book movies and especially the first Joker film.

Avoid, but if morbid curiosity gets the better of you, watch it with either free cinema tickets in the afternoon so you don't waste an evening, or hold out until it arrives on a streaming platform (in the very near future i imagine)."
1.0,5 October 2024,
8.0,9 October 2024,"It is not only about the musical, the plot also sucks. You will spend more than 70% of the movie listening to Lady Gaga singing all the time. Sometimes, I think she could just talk instead of singing. At first, I could still tolerate her singing a little, but her singing all the time just becomes annoying. You cannot understand Arthur-sometimes he wants to be the crazy 'Joker,' and sometimes he just wants to be himself, 'Arthur.' This makes the character hard to follow. My suggestion is not to spend your time and money watching this movie in the cinema. Instead, watch it online to see how bad it is!"
7.0,9 October 2024,"I read all the reviews before going to see joker and was going into this movie with very little hope and expecting a real disappointment.

But in my opinion Joker Folie à Deux Is a well-crafted dive into the psychosis of Arthurs flecks mind.

It shows the flaws and cracks in society and how a deranged abused person can fall through those cracks and rise back up as a prop for hire.

A prop to make other deranged people feel something more in their boring prototypical narcissistic lives. Striving for excitement and leaching off of one's pain, and their dive into murderous insanity and fascination they have for him, so much so that it propels Arthur fleck into embracing the joker persona...Harlee Quinn is one of those people.

She's fascinated by the joker's chaotic murderous acts but wouldn't even bat an eye at the real Arthur fleck before the joker persona took over.

The movie really shows how uncompassionate and inhumane society can really be.

How humans can prop people up as some kind of superficial idol. And how quick we are to turn on them when they don't remain the plaything you wanted. It also depicts how detrimental mental illness can be.

The music can be a little much at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people are saying. I saw a lot of reviews saying the music had nothing to do with the plot. It was very much a part of the plot if you pay attention. And in all honestly i wouldn't classify this movie as a musical its more of a thought-provoking drama with some singing here and there.

All in all, i think it was a good movie that has you thinking at the end. And the ending of the movie in my opinion has fight club written all over it if you have seen it i hope you understand what im saying.

Was it perfect? No. It could have been better but it's nowhere near as bad as its rating. I recommend seeing it. Form your own opinion. I enjoyed it and it had me engrossed from beginning to end."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Here's a corrected version of your text:

""What are you guys really doing with this movie? After an amazing first part, you created this piece of garbage? The plot is very poor, and we saw a pathetic Joker, far from the essence of the criminal character we see in the comics. Lady Gaga was only included in this film to sing, because her portrayal of Harley was awful. Someone, anyone, please, destroy this disappointment movie and create a new one that reflects what we saw in the first movie: a rising Joker who eventually will be amazing criminal. The worst part of the movie was the ending. If I could throw anything out of this film, it would be the singing and the ending."""

7.0,6 October 2024,"It is a truism in cinema that Luke becoming a Jedi is more interesting than Luke being a Jedi. This is the problem that Joker 2 faces. The first film was a fantastic exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into insanity and violence. So what to do with the second...?

The choice to make it a musical was bold. It captures Fleck's need for escape, and the twisted romanticism of his relationship with Harley.

Unfortunately, the strategy falls flat at times, with the musical sequences dragging on and the plot being very thin. Phoenix is once again amazing as Fleck, showing the full range of his talent. Brendan Gleeson plays the cruel Irish prison guard like it is second nature and Lady Gaga is fine as Harley (but not outstanding - Margot Robbie has nothing to worry about).

I would give this film 6/10, except for the ending, which is (in my opinion) brilliant, thus earning the film an additional point. I cannot say more about the ending without spoilers, other than it fixes one of the issues that I had with the original Joker film."
3.0,6 October 2024,"Here's what u get when Comic haters are allowed to retell a story that's solely aimed to annihilate a character. This lifeless Arthur Fleck who does nothing but laugh and sing slow tunes all day could never masquerade as the Joker. Who said this was supposed to be a musical and the singing wasn't great. Every three minutes he trails off singing or humming about some nonsense instead of acting it out. So boring I didn't believe it could be slower than the first one but it's three times worse. Lady Gaga knows damn well this movie isn't good and the reviews will show it. Total waste of time, Who knows how much money it'll make but the bottom line will be the same. People are gonna be pissed after watching this foolery I guarantee it."
6.0,5 October 2024,"This was advertised as another action/drama like the first film. Instead you get a messy musical.

They didn't just drop the ball, they stomped on it, set it on fire and then pi**ed on the ashes.

Not surprised that there are bits in the trailer that looked good that were not in the final film.

I loved the first film for it's portrait of a man who is pushed too far but also you never quite know who is telling him the truth and what he sees is reality, this is more like Arthur fleck took acid and listened to a radio for 2 hours.

The court scene explosion that is a huge part of the trailer is right near the end and they do nothing with it as a plot device."

6.0,2 October 2024,"""Joker"" is an insult to DC fans is also subjective and depends on individual preferences. While some DC fans have praised the film for its dark and gritty tone, others have criticized it for its departure from traditional superhero narratives.

Here are some reasons why some DC fans might feel that ""Joker"" is an insult:

Lack of superhero elements: The film does not feature any traditional superhero elements, such as superpowers or costumes. Some fans may have expected to see more of the typical DC universe in a Joker film.

Dark and gritty tone: While the film's dark tone was praised by many, others found it to be too extreme or depressing for a superhero-related movie.

Character interpretation: Some fans may have felt that the film's portrayal of the Joker was too different from previous interpretations of the character.

It's important to remember that ""Joker"" was intended to be a standalone film, not a typical superhero movie. The filmmakers aimed to explore the psychology of a villain and the societal factors that contribute to his descent into madness."
3.0,9 October 2024,"No it's not the same film as the first.

The musical fantasy was something to get used to but once you accept it... understand this is Arthur slipping out of reality and once again(like we saw in the first film) Arthur falling into a fantasy world as he does when he fixates on women and he comes off his medication.

The musical fantasy scenes are merely a delve into Arthur and Harley's minds and could easily fall out of the film without any difference to plot or story.

I actually enjoyed this film. The cinematography was stunning.. gaga was perfect. Phoenix was incredible. Give it a chance and be open."
10.0,1 October 2024,"Joker 2 fails to entertain, simply as that.

Director Todd Phillips disregards the number one rule in entertainment; ""always give the audience what they want"", and instead delivers a take on self-hatred aiming to destroy his previous creation.

If you think about it, this entire project is his commentary regarding the praise and admiration from audiences worldwide toward Arthur after watching the far superior Joker.

It took me less than an hour to understand that this time, in Joker 2, Phillips wants to destroy Arthurs's image while preaching that the likes of him should not be praised. Perhaps, Todd felt somewhat responsible for unintentionally inspiring a legion of incels. Who knows, and who cares?

This film is a very weak musical and a very bad comic adaptation.

Phoenix has moments where he shines, but he's great and it's expected.

Gaga is just bait.

The fact is that Joker 2 will be remembered as just another example of why film classics shouldn't get sequels.

For me, there is no Joker 2.

Will never watch it again.

Will never recommend it.

Save your money.

And if you ever see it listed on streaming, just watch 2019 Joker again.

You welcome."
7.0,14 October 2024,"Yeah, after all the bad reviews and youtube videos I have seen so far I was convinced that this movie was not just a waste of time but an actual epitome of bad modern cinema.

So I watched it. And... I don't really get what's all the fuss about? What you are people really so upset about in such way you literally call this ""the worst sequel/movie of all time""?

The craziness is there, the focus on mental illness, how terrible, an impossible maze of a mind that can be for an individual, that could be anyone in our society, a society that overlooks, disregards, mishandling, has still way less clue what to do witch such people in need of mental help.

And probably that's the case this movie wanted to make, that you don't need to be a special, infamous, specific villainy individual to have such issues in your head. That can be anyone: you, your neighbor, everyday people all around you, 'coz it's no joke, not something to mess with, it's serious matter, it leads to all kinds off unprecedented, unexpected destructive outcomes to your surroundings, the society, anything that somewhat is part of a system.

So, in a way, this movie doesn't do this theme differently than the first installment. But it does a sequel people would not expect after the conclusion of its predecessor.

But that's the case of relying on someone that is sick, unstable, as in has deep sickness that is totally unpalatable for the system, he is a dysfunctional citizen and a human being. A danger to any society. He doesn't even know who he is, when he becomes Joker, he doesn't feel like it for long, he is not that terrible, but when he is that boring, broken Arthur, he wants to be Joker, it's a Ying Yang of self-identity, one of the worst things a human being can have, ever.

And people wanted to be inspired by a chaotic mind, that even for itself has no rules. It's not solid, turns itself upside down like an everlasting generator of random morality based on a sociopathic mindset.

The fanatics wanted Joker to be a symbol of revolution, an anarchist, to be someone against the system, the machine, the ""oppressor"", the same way the lunatics in Arkham have seen him, the guy who is not afraid to be who he is, who can define himself. And for a moment he thought he is Joker, the vengeful psychopath that rages against anyone that has negative effect on him, who attacked him, is a danger to him without any thought of consequences.

But no. He realizes (which is in a way a positive sign for a mentally ill person with such inner struggles) he is not the Joker, he doesn't feel like that's really him. He faces the truth. He is Arthur, that broken man and he is in need for help just like anyone else.

To me this movie didn't feel like it wants to retcon everything that happened in the first movie, nor it wants to be pointing at us liking the predecessor. It's not a movie that represents Tod showing his middle finger to the audience. Conceptually, a Joker has no rules, just like in Dark Knight, it is always about breaking the habit, the rules, and the movie, the story works similarly to that concept: You wanted an anti-hero? Why? Based on what? You wanted an actual villain? Why? Because he is suppose to be THE Joker? You wanted a confident psychopath who knows who he is, like Heath Ledger's Joker? Well, we have a bad news for you. This is about the issues of mental illness, the ""reality"" of it... and it's messed up!

Pros: * The visuals, cinematography is superb, just like for the first one.

* I didn't mind the singing parts of the movie, in most cases they worked really well, and fitting to the whole mind-nutty storytelling the first movie had. On the other hand, this is not even a musical per se as everyone suggest it is, I mean... have you seen that terrible movie Cats? Or Les Miserables? Because there is a heavy contrast between this and those movies. And I don't know what trailers you guys have seen, but it was actually marketed that there will be singing, and probably takes heavily on that.

* I don't like Lady Gaga, she is actually pissing me off, but she did well in this movie, she can act, not to mention Phoenix, one of the best, he might also be a problematic person in real life with questionable ideals he supports, but the guy is great as hell still.

*The storytelling in its nature still represents that unreliable structure that builds on a massively problematic mind, as in the first movie, and it should scare people.

Cons: *Sometimes it seems like it has deep understanding of sociopathy (or any complex mental health issues) and all the problematics surrounding it. However, the ending, when the lunatic talks to Arthur and referring to himself as ""a psychopath"" I was totally thrown off, like seriously, a sick individual barely identifies him/herself as sick, just like a psycho won't call him/herself a psychopath. So the ending scene was totally redundant and plain stupid.

* There could still be more dramatic ways of illustrating Arthur struggling with self-identity, how he lets Joker coming out of him etc., because in the end of the day, the whole ""climax"" of the court scene seems like it was resolved with ""well, I'm sorry that I had such effect this little guy's mental health, I didn't mean that, wasn't my intention"". So... this whole inner struggle could still be more complex.

* Probably there are way too many songs, I would decrease them by one or two, but they still don't feel like they are fillers or anything, people get way too harsh when criticizing these sections.

So... I ended up rambling here with an essay, sorry for that, but I think you catch my drift, right. That the audience just really overreacting now, and everybody rely on some random, nobody youtuber's opinions, like they have better tastes than the viewers themselves. No, make your own opinions about the movies you watch, about the music you listen to, because everyone is just becoming more of a sheeple and repeating the same words their influencers say, and it got to really ridiculous, laughable extent. Make your own conclusions.

Overall, it's not a must see motion picture at all, and not a terrible one either. It has that same ""well, I have no idea what to think about it after all, but it was somewhat entertaining and kinda original"" effect just like the first movie had. It is a satire in a way, it has killer jokes, like, you just end up laughing how ridiculous, grotesque they can get, but also get horrified at the same time. An interesting watch."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Joker is an established character with a fan base. I really enjoyed the take in the first one. They approached from a unique angle and developed a great character for us to invest in.

In a time when superhero movies had all gone to a ridiculous large scale with multiverses and alien invasions (which I enjoy), I really like that the original felt more reality based. I recommended it to people that don't even particularly like superhero stuff. It was a great drama that happened to be about a comic book character. But the core audience was still Batman fans. It's not an audience that was calling for a musical. I'm all in favour of people taking chances with being creative but think this should have been something done with a different joker and completely stand alone.

The original was an amazing film. Could easily have been left alone or build its own franchise. Now they've buried it. Such a waste of great potential."
2.0,4 October 2024,"This journey through the Joker and Fleck is well done. The idea of music revealing the Joker in action was not unique but worked well for me. I enjoyed the movie even with the disappointments it brought me to. I had hopes for Fleck. But not everyone can live up to the hopes we have for them. This movie is romantic, funny, heartbreaking, with a non typical ending. I look forward to watching it again. The acting is fantastic, the music is enjoyable with great song choices! Though the environment is always changing it leaves you with a sense of uncomfortableness. Which kept me engaged throughout."
7.0,20 October 2024,"I had very mixed feelings. In the end, I thought it was pretty good. Nice visuals. It was nice to watch. Nicely shot. I thought it started out pretty interesting, and the turning point came when the singing started. What can I say :D I didn't like it very much. I'd probably take Furt if it wasn't a musical, but what the hell, well. Mostly I thought the whole thing was pretty pointless. I loved that first episode from 2019 and it worked perfectly well in my opinion and didn't need a sequel at all, which is something I've been telling myself for a long time, but so I gave it a chance and sadly I wasn't convinced. On one hand it wasn't that bad in my opinion. In the end, I thought it was good. That's all. Nothing less. It had its good moments. I thought it was interesting at times. I just think the fact that it's a musical hurt it. I didn't find that much to my liking, though at times it wasn't bad thanks to the aforementioned visuals. So the biggest crack in my opinion is that it's a pointless sequel. It didn't need to be made. Too bad. The finale wasn't bad in my opinion, but unfortunately only good and not even REMOTELY as magical for me as the previous installment."

After five long years of being extremely excited for part two, I feel completely and utterly betrayed. The first part was dark, intense, and brilliantly crafted-this one feels like a complete mockery. It's as if they threw away everything that made the original great. The decision to turn it into some kind of bizarre musical was the worst creative choice possible. It destroyed all the tension and atmosphere that made the original so impactful. The whole thing feels disjointed, out of place, and frankly, like a slap in the face to fans who loved the first movie. I'm incredibly angry and disappointed, and I can't understand how they thought this would appeal to anyone."""

10.0,6 October 2024,"I went into this film after reading the critiques with low expectations, but willing to be surprised & I was, but not pleasantly so. ""Low"" was an unfortunate overestimate.

Todd Phillips has taken a character with depth and despite his heinous acts, a liability & turnd him into a wheelbarrow for a Heath Ledger rip-off set up. Disrespectful to both characters.

To say nothing of the abomination that is ""Lee Quinzel"" a poor mans Harley Quinn that actually subtracts from the film.

A back alley root canal without anaesthetic would be a better (and more enjoyable) way to spend 2hrs & 18min.

This not takes my #1 spot for worst film I have ever seen."
7.0,6 October 2024,"Going by most reviews you may think this movie is worse than cancer...

Coming out of the cinema theater, I'm no different from, perhaps, thousand other moviegoers who consider 2019 Joker a cinematic event in both themes and artistry.

However, here in 2024, Joker 2: Folie à Deux Director Todd Phillips comes back with an idea that could've / should've been genius - what if Arthur Fleck's Joker is the inspiration of the true Joker?

This approach tries to break free from repetition when compared to any other comic film. The problem is, and this is the biggest oversight in Phillips's way of thinking, that audiences worldwide chose Arthur as their new Joker.

The idea of switching his creation for Christopher Nolan's - and let's not go around the bush, the Psychopath who ends Arthur's life at the end of this film is none other than Heath Ledger's Joker, is both clever and dumb. First, it makes absolutely no sense when we try to understand both timelines; Phillip's Joker takes place back in the 1980s while Nolan's Joker is thriving in the early 2000s. Second, minimizes completely Arthur's journey leaving him as the pathetic disappointment that inspired the real Clown Prince of Crime.

This also means that Ledger's Joker was in his mid-40s??

This opens the possibility of a third chapter, that according to Phillips will never happen; at least not with him as Director, where Harley Quinn returns to Arkham as the Psychiatrist she truly is after finding out that Arthur was slain by the new Joker - who is everything she wanted Arthur to be, but couldn't.

If instead of musical numbers, and slowly than watching paint dry sequences, this film would've included that ending - the ending where Harley meets Nolan's Joker and their ""Folie à Deux"" connects. If I had gotten that this film could've been something truly special.

At least to me.

Unfortunately, we got this half-cooked thing that feels like a mockery, I think unintentionally, of what should remain as a film classic; 2019 Joker."
1.0,6 October 2024,
2.0,6 October 2024,"The audience is holding its breath for more Joker, to relive the grandiose rise of a sad clown, this time with an equally demented partner. And then... They're given the Joker, through heavy references. But it doesn't ring true.

They're given Harleen Quinzel, but she's never really Harley Quinn, and is merely a screenplay pawn.

They're given innovations, especially musical ones, but nothing seems to work.

There's something missing, where's the grandiose ?

Because here, we're offered not a rise, but a deconstruction. There's no grandeur, just pure despair.

And that's not quite Joker, but Arthur. Harleen is just there to emphasize this dissociation, as is the audience, who leave the theater disappointed, after an abrupt, brutal ending, like the punchline of a bad joke: ""The first one was better""? They wanted to see Joker, that's all, in all his political panache; they didn't want to see Arthur, a man abused, manipulated, mocked and, above all, a murderer. Stripped of his martyr status, he's no longer a symbol, he's no longer cool, he's no longer stylish, he's no longer trendy.

Sorry, but human misery no longer sells when it's not about dancing down a flight of stairs in a suit. Dance here is at the service of a musical drama full of wrong notes that plunges us into discomfort, and few people are ready to accept this feeling, and prefer to reject it.

But ""THAT'S life folks"".

PS: Imax is not always used throughout the film, which creates visual breaks."
6.0,12 October 2024,"A movie that seems more interesting trying to figure out why everything was done the way it was than anything the movie presents. There are many interesting ideas that would be excellent on their own. But all together makes this a confusing mishmash themes and styles.

The best parts of the movie are the returning elements from the first film. Joaquin Phoenix won an Oscar for the first film and, while not quite as impressive, still does an amazing job. He is once again utterly fascinating to watch. Zazie Beetz's brief appearance is an excellent counter-point to her portrayal in the first one, which was largely a fantasy. She recontextualizes moments from the first and reinforces how unreliable a narrator Arthur is. I wish the movie did more of this to make Arthur and the audience doubt what really has happened. Though it's Leigh Gill who steals the movie with a single scene. Gary Puddles' testimony is equal parts awkwardly funny and heartbreaking. It's that one scene that shows what the movie could have been to really equal the first.

The movie looks as good as the first. Gotham is shown as being dark and dirty, a shame that so little of the movie is set in the city at large. Arkham feels impressive, though it's pretty much the same feeling every other prison and asylum movie has. The musical sequences lovingly recreate the look and feel of classic musicals like Singin' in the Rain, Mary Poppins, Sony & Cher. It's a pretty sharp contrast between the real scenes and the fantasy musicals.

The story touches on several ideas that would be better developed on their own. I like the idea of seeing the trial and aftermath of the previous film's climax, something not really done since the finale of Star Trek IV. Given how sympathetic the first film made Arthur, it would have been interesting to see him turn the tables and make others actually see his side. Instead, the trial scenes largely rehash the first film and continually make clear that Arthur is entirely at fault. It ends up pretty dull.

Lady Gaga is pretty good as Harley Quinn, a contrast to the already crazed Margot Robbie version. It's not all that different from her role in A Star Is Born but it works within the world of this Joker. A movie actually featuring Harley's decent into Joker's madness would be great, there is a psychological term for women who fall in love with dangerous psychos like Ted Bundy and Charles Manson. But this story comes and goes, sometimes letting the audience forget she even exists.

The biggest problem with the movie is Joker himself. The first film embodied the phrase ""A child not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth."" Arthur started out a pathetic nobody who just wanted people to be happy, and ended up inciting a mass riot as he embraced the Joker identity. This movie tries to do the same thing again. It's not Hangover 2 bad. But it starts off with Arthur once again being a pathetic nobody, just a famous one, and tries to build him back up to being Joker. A better movie would have explored how this disturbed individual would've reacted to suddenly being a beloved for his sins. The other problem with Arthur is that he has no agency. Only at one point does he actively try to do anything, instead mostly following around what others tell him to do. Harley, his lawyer, the judge, and his fans are all the ones who make the decisions that move the story. He also only truly becomes Joker in one scene, plus the fantasy musicals. Putting on the Foghorn Leghorn accent to question Puddles is, again, absolutely brilliant and should've been the basis for everything else.

There's also no release, no sense of satisfaction. The two dance scenes from the first symbolized great moments for Arthur. The bathroom when he broke away from society's restrictions, and the stairs when he finally took control of his life. There was meaning to them cause they were steps towards being Joker. This movie has guards beating Arthur, lawyers dissing him, and the media making lousy movies about him. But never is there any emotional payoff to these things. It works in an arthouse kind of way, but it's disappointing for the producers to seemingly hate their own character so much.

While the musical sequences look nice, they are the most annoying feature largely because there's so many of them. The music choices are fine, though nothing as memorable as the first film. Gaga is never given a chance to show off her talents. And there's just too many musical sequences. Towards the end I could hear the rest of the audience grown as another musical started. I get that they're supposed to represent meaningful moments between Arthur and Harley, but dial it back a bit.

Then there's the ending. An ending that will be talked about for years to come, and not for good reasons. A movie lives or dies on its ending, and this one seems to almost be an attack on fans who actually enjoyed the first by seeming to suggest both movies don't matter. There's rumors that Todd Phillips didn't want to make another. That's fine, but he didn't have to make what could be the worst possible ending in the superhero genre.

There are moments of brilliance, hinting at what a good sequel could have been. But ultimately it ends up as a needless epilogue to a movie they apparently did not understand themselves."
5.0,6 October 2024,"It is definitely a step down from its first movie. It starts very slow, only beyond halfway through the movie we somewhat get an explanation to why we had to witness so many musical scenes; But there was too many, not fit for a Batman fan: who likes a dark story and dark villains.

During the latter half of the film I tried considering continuously that this is an origins story for the Joker (in that particular parallel universe). However, considering both that Bruce Wayne is still a child in the movie, and the ending of the film, suggests that there will never be an encounter between future Batman and the Joker.

Although (spoiler( Harley Quinn is pregnant, maybe that's the Joker."
7.0,6 October 2024,"Joker 2 struggles to find its footing, delivering a slow and often tedious experience. The pacing feels labored, with the story dragging on longer than necessary, making it hard to stay engaged. While the musical numbers aim to inject energy, they end up feeling both overindulgent and underwhelming, leaving a confusing impression rather than enhancing the narrative. Overall, this sequel fails to capture the charm of the original, making it a lackluster addition to the franchise. All I can say is that if I had watched this at home and did not spend money on the tickets. I would not have finished it."
1.0,6 October 2024,"To start off, I'll say that I absolutely loved the original Joker (2019), like most of the other reviewers have stated. This film is something different entirely from the previous entry, which was specified early on when it was first announced. With it being revealed as a ""musical"", fans of the first film were immediately turned off, which is understandable - at first glance. It may be hard to head into this knowing the prior information as it may be discouraging, however, the film pulls it off in more ways than one.

This is Todd Phillip's interpretation of the character of The Joker. As a director, he does have the right to interpret the character in any way he chooses. I fully supported the way he explored the character in the first film. I still support his choices here, because in reality, the sequel has more of the same themes and elements of the original. The film is bold in a lot of ways, changing the style here and there to focus on a new aspect of Arthur Fleck's mental illness, being music, and expressing himself in that new way. Of course the musical aspects are not for everyone, and it's going to turn a lot of people away, but it's important to give it a chance as I did. Did people just forget that in the first entry Arthur danced, sang, and even listened to old songs to get in the mood to be Joker? The themes are just stronger in this film.

Joker (2019) is my favorite film ever made, so seeing the reviews pour in so negatively for the sequel of course had me worried. After seeing it for myself, I can confidently say that people are severely overreacting. Whether it's fans of the original, Batman comic book fans, or just people who hate musicals. I'm not a huge musical fan myself either, and it was a bit difficult to adjust to this after the first song began, but with time it did weave into the story perfectly. Arthur and Harley bounce off of each other so perfectly, and they feel like a real dysfunctional couple. They share the screen in such a unique way that it fits so well into the universe that Todd Phillips created.

As for the acting, Joaquin Phoenix is again fantastic, Lady Gaga isn't as terrible as people say she is either, and everyone else in the film pulls together to make it one cohesive story. There are still emotional gut punches, there are shocking reveals, and there are even funny moments too. This is completely different from the original, but it is also very similar in a lot of thematic ways. The cinematography is outstanding like the first film, the sets are amazing like the first film, and the story is pretty good all things considered.

So, the bottom line, is it perfect? Not even close. Is it worth watching? Of course. It's not that bad, and that's coming from a die hard fan of the original. It's experimental, it tries a lot of new things, it succeeds for the majority of the time, and fails few and far between. As for the whole ending debacle, I thought it was a fine ending. It was shocking of course, as I'm sure that was the intention, but it was a fine ending to the story. Give it a chance, maybe rewatch it again if you have to. Look at it with an open mind, like we all did with the first film. 7/10."

7.0,9 October 2024,"Same vibe as the first one. Making a movie about what society makes you feel sometimes when nobody really cares about what you are really saying and feeling, feeling like you are not really heard by anyone. This one is more about a love story that many people can relate to; when you meet someone who sees you, hears you, and is able to read you like you always want to show to the real world. This person sees the true colors of yourself. It's called love. This carries a profound message like the first but with a different touch that makes it comforting.

The filming of the movie is sublime, and you can clearly see the high budget they had with these shots. Joaquin was perfect again in the role, and it's easy for the viewers to have empathy with this character. Lady Gaga was a nice addition for sure, for her voice alone but sometimes it was too much... Let me explain.

I feel like it was a ""dramatic musical movie."" At certain times, it makes you feel like they just want to show off Lady Gaga's voice when it wasn't really needed in the scene. Joaquin has this aspect too. I found many times that I was bored by that aspect during the film. Don't get me wrong, I like some musical comedies when they are done at the right time and the movie is directly going for that direction, but I really feel like Joker Part 2, a DC movie, was not really the place to show as many musical scenes like that. I mean, I'm pretty sure if they replaced these parts with real conversation and profound scripts that add more value than just songs, it would be a far better movie. I haven't read any reviews yet, but I think I'm not the only one who thinks that. Besides that, the first one was a better film, no doubt about that in many ways but because Joker 1 was excellent, the expectations for the second part were surely pretty high, and I think for that reason alone, you will have some disappointment about certain things in the movie that in your head you would have done differently to make it more interesting. Sometimes it was a bit too much political, too much rules but I can understand that direction because of the plot. It may had been better again if it was less intense in that regard but I think they have also done a great job because it was a psychological drama in a sense so it was needed for sure.

It had some pretty intense scenes. Some of them made my heart pound like crazy, creating a rollercoaster of emotions just like the other movie. I cried also, don't really know why but at the beginning, I found myself too deep in the story, feeling like Arthur (Joaquin) deserved to be treated better than that. I found the instant connection he had with Lee so touching, and it made me smile and feel really comforted as well just like a feeling of warm in the winter.

This was an intense film that makes you think about your relationships in life and how you treat people around you, specially people that are different from the ""normality"". You definitely feel the buzz a bit after you exit the cinema, and it makes you rethink the whole movie. It opens discussions with other cinephiles about your experience when watching the movie, and I think it is really well done for that reason too. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Love it or hate it, the purpose of cinema and the essence of art that they capture is on point, you cannot deny it. That's life...

Something akin to a modern Rocky horror but without the cult charm: 30 minutes of decent plot allows it to scrape a 6/10. That is in an IMAXX cinema screen. I suspect there was a decision to stretch two films into three and leverage Lady Gagas singing ability but sadly she became the whole plot. Somewhat of a shame also is the iteration of old plot aspects from Joker and the reliance on these a few too many times.

8.0,6 October 2024,"What was once a haunting character study has now devolved into a confusing mess of random musical numbers that feel jarring and out of place. The tonal shift is so stark that it's hard to believe this is even the same character or world. Instead of delving deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, the film suddenly bursts into song and dance, completely disrupting the tension and grit that defined the first movie.

Joaquin Phoenix, who brilliantly portrayed the tortured soul of Arthur in the first film, seems lost here. While he is still committed to the role, the musical format doesn't suit him or the character. It's hard to take the film seriously when moments of emotional intensity are broken up by surreal, Broadway-style performances that seem plucked from a different movie entirely."
6.0,11 October 2024,"After hearing about how Joker: Folie À Deux has been received, and feeling like it was going to be a massive let-down, I found that it really wasn't that bad.

Joker: Folie à Duex is filmed in much the same way as the first Joker movie. It is moody and dark, and it delves more into the mentality of Arthur after his actions in the first movie. However, this time, it has been turned into a bit of a musical. And it is there in which this movie creates its own problems.

Musically, there is a lot to enjoy. It has a very good soundtrack, and the on-screen performances during the musical parts are pretty good. However, I feel that some of those musical parts were unnecessary, a couple felt forced, and ultimately, I think there were maybe two too many musical performances in the movie.

I didn't care none too much about Harley's character (aka Lee) and how she was introduced, though Lady Gaga did act her part very well, and her singing is great. It is a shame that the writers didn't introduce her character in a way that his cult following was towards the end of the last movie. Here, they chose to drop Lee into the story in a way that didn't really make use of that factor and, instead, dropped her in as someone who seemed a little fascinated or obsessed with Arthur.

This dynamic works in places, especially when they're getting to know each other, but it gives you a false sense of security in their blossoming relationship because later on in the film it is unexpectedly broken with some relative ease.

I don't want to get into too much with this review because I don't want to include spoilers. It is a movie that is worth a watch if you are fine with musicals. I think it received a bit hate because I believe fans of the first movie were probably expecting some kind of evolution in Arthur, turning into the killer and public nuisance most synonymous in the various iterations of Batman, and potentially becoming more twisted as the movie went on.

It is nothing like that.

Instead we have a movie that is interesting and brave in its direction but ultimately it doesn't pay off."

3.0,5 October 2024,If you have a background in film and theatre this movie is soooooooo enjoyable.... Regular people cannot fully observe the brilliance of this movie without an education in film. The cinematography alone was a masterpiece. The acting was so good it almost made me cry. The music showed a performance that perfectly reflected the difference between reality and his Joker world. If I could give it more than 10 stars I would! Please please please don't listen to all these other reviews.... This film is now on my all time favorite films list. It deserves all the Oscar's especially for lead male and cinematography.
7.0,12 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" proves to be a conflicting cinematic experience. Joaquin Phoenix reaffirms his extraordinary talent, delivering a masterful and engaging performance that reaches thrilling heights in some scenes. However, the film seems to deviate from its focus on the protagonist to give ample space to Lady Gaga, creating an imbalance in the narrative.

The musical approach works admirably in the first third of the film, enriching the plot with pathos. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, this stylistic element becomes redundant, appearing forced to the viewer's eyes.

The film's initial potential promised a work as memorable as its predecessor, but it seems that commercial interests prevailed over the overall quality of the plot. It's surprising that Warner Bros. Approved a project that, even upon superficial analysis, reveals these issues.

Despite the criticisms, Phoenix's commitment and extraordinary performance deserve recognition. For this reason, I give the film a 7, believing that the current IMDb rating doesn't do justice to the intensity and strength of his interpretation."
3.0,11 October 2024,"The first Todd Phillips directed Joker film made an eye watering billion dollars at the box office. At the time making it the highest grossing R rated film of all time, a feat that has only recently been beaten by Deadpool and Wolverine.

Despite the financial success of the first film it remained divisive in the court of public opinion. With that in mind when the negative reviews started coming out for this sequel I really wanted to disagree with them as I love the first film. Unfortunately however I simply can't defend this film.

Carrying on from where the first film ended Joker is behind bars and back to being Arthur Fleck. As has been highly advertised he meets and falls in love with Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) this gives him a temporary renewed sense of confidence. That is about all 'Lee' is in this film to do however. I can't help but feeling that it could have been any female love interest played by any other actor and the effect on the narrative would have been minimal. What a waste!

So anyway the film casts Lady Gaga and so why not make it a musical. Whilst I respect filmmakers trying something different it's hard to commend the experiment when the result is as poor as this sequel is. Whilst unorthodox, I do see how this film could have been successful as a musical. Musicals however use the lyrics of the songs to advance the narrative. Todd Philips however tries to use the musical numbers to illustrate Arthur's mental state which not only serves to not advance the narrative but also doesn't really teach us anymore about his character that we didn't already know.

When considering this films narrative as a whole I can't help but see it as an overly inflated epilogue of the first film. It doesn't really have any more to say in a social political sense and instead retreads a lot of the same ideas of the first film. Perhaps most frustratingly for me is that not only is this sequel a failure but it also feels like a bad stain on the reputation of the brilliant first film. Maybe this was intentional, perhaps this was Todd Phillips taking Warner Bros money and effectively running away. Regardless I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a feeling of utter disappointment."
6.0,8 October 2024,"I felt positively about the first ""Joker"" film, though not perhaps as positively as many others did, so perhaps it's quite fitting that I feel negatively about ""Joker: Folie a Deux"" though not as negatively as many others seem too.

Whilst awaiting a competency hearing ahead of his trial for several counts of murder, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) meets Lee (Lady Gaga) another patient at Arkham, though one on minimum security. Fleck is allowed to participate in the musical therapy class where he talks to Lee, who explains that she loved 'The Joker' since seeing him in a TV movie about his actions and the pair begin a love affair. Fleck is torn between supporters who want to see ""The Joker"", and his lawyer Maryanne (Catherine Keener) trying to make a case for him avoiding the death penalty, for reasons of insanity.

Not unlike the first film, ""Folie a Deux"" again engages in numerous fantasies and dream sequences allowing you to question which sections are actually happening and which are ""made up"". Because of that it's open to endless interpretation and analysis. Personally, I don't particularly buy the ""we must punish the people with whom the first film resonated, because they are the 'wrong people'"" suggestion. If, for no other reason, than it's produced by Warner Brothers who have already shown their willingness to take a completed movie and turn it into a vaulted tax write off. That argument gives the producers too much credit.

I did feel like the musical numbers were disappointing. I'm not sure why, given the time, and money, to turn their fantasy dance numbers into almost anything - they're all so low key. Lady Gaga particularly keeps things restrained, perhaps as if she (or the production) was concerned about blowing Phoenix away too much. It feels like a small film too, essentially restrained to only three or four real sets. The courtroom scenes never feel like they really get going and there's no twist or reveals that stem from that.

I haven't revisited the first ""Joker"" film, since seeing it at the cinema and I can't imagine that I'll be back to this one again, but I never felt it was ""walking out"" bad - just dull."

1.0,5 October 2024,"Treat this as its own movie. Forget the first film. That's what I was telling myself throughout. And for most of this movie, this mantra made a difference for me.

Is it a musical?

Are they really singing?

Is it just, like one or two songs?

Oh, it's a musical all right!

And in every single sense of the word, it's a musical.

It's way-hey-hey more musical than Marvel, or DC.

Hamilton is more hero than this.

But I got no problem with this.

I really don't.

It's got Lady Gaga in it.

Love her!

I expect her to sing.

I want her to sing.

Joaquin Phoenix can sing too.

I'm cool with that.

But can somebody get this guy a sandwich, please?

Good grief.

Brendan Gleason, Steve Coogan, Catherine Keener and Zazie Beetz.

Yes. Yes. Yes. And yaaaaaaaassss!!

Even Jacob Lofland as Ricky Meline. A true rising star.

I think he should be cast as Alex in Michael Mann's Heat prequel-sequel, Heat 2.

But what doesn't kill this movie is all the song and dance numbers, or even all the courtroom drama, no, what kills it is the ending.

That ending.

I admire the Arkham ambition of the filmmaker. I can appreciate his really going for it with the music.

I was at an 8 or 9 the whole way. I really was.

Until the end."
10.0,4 October 2024,"If you don't know it is a musical, you will be bored to death.

Useless romantic story with Joker being shown so weak, vulnerable and accepting defeat.

If you want to ruin audience expectations, just take a classic villain movie and turn it into Disney princess.

The storyline does not move forward at all,if we remove the songs , runtime of the movie would be reduced to 40% The genre of the movie should not be changed. Everytime a new song comes up there would a murmur of disappointment in the theatre on top of that even the songs are boring. Lady gaga as Harley has degraded the character.

Simply sad and disappointed."
6.0,13 October 2024,
3.0,20 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" doesn't build on the success of the first film-it feels like two hours of filler with musical interludes. Just as something starts to develop, the flow is interrupted by another song, leaving you disoriented and disconnected from the plot. It seems more focused on finding a way to feature Lady Gaga than crafting a coherent narrative. The Joker himself feels distant from the menacing, complex character of the first movie, and even further from his iconic portrayal in the comics. Since when does the Joker let himself be manipulated by Harley Quinn? In what world does that happen? Half the audience seemed to be either checking out mentally or walking out physically before the credits rolled."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I'm also one who loved the first film (it was a solid 10/10 for me) and had low expectations for this - but I'm happy to say it's better than I was expecting after all the reviews. Except for maybe 2, the musical numbers are short and fit the story at that moment (that was the biggest complaint I heard). I thought the story and plot were fine and made sense, although I can see the point in what people say that it feels like a long epilog. Did not feel boring though although I knew quite a bit of spoilers. The soundtrack was the biggest letdown for me - except for ""If You Go Away"" nothing else was memorable (by contrast with the first film, in which most music was great)"
7.0,6 October 2024,"No Spoilers... 5 years ago JOKER was released and it became an phenomenal sensation throughout the world for it's unique take on character showing harsh reality of this world in a bleak and violent story about an mentally ill character, it was a masterpiece but after that film earned 1B WB forced a sequel that shouldn't have made in the first place.. This film continues the story from 1st film but didn't deliver what it promised rather it becomes a meta movie which mocks the character and audience instead of progressing the story in a meaningful way.. Joaquin pheonix still manage to deliver a steller performance and Lady Gaga was also good but film fails from a storytelling point where nothing really happens which makes audience feel the same way they felt in 2019,Harley Quinn is barely present and appears only here and there only to manipulate Arthur which let nowhere at the end..Arthur is now imprisoned in Arkham Asylum and waiting for his trial where he meets Harley Quinn but after that it becomes just some fantasy filled musical sequences and courtroom drama with an lackluster climax which destroys the legacy of the original film and the character shown in that,maybe a film about Joker and Harley escaping and doing crazy acts would've been received better .. Now I don't have any problems with musical numbers and court room drama scenes were also we'll acted but joker was more of a plot device than an actual being here.. This film should have been about Joker and Harley doing ultimate madness which delivers on its Foile à Deux name which means madness for two.. Twist ending was good but it feels forced instead of earned there were also some deeply disturbing scenes like the first one and dark beautiful cinematography and haunting score is what keeps this film together.. It also makes a point that people will only love you when you act like their own will but if you don't they'll abandon you, and that's what it happening in this movies in real world also audience wanted a Joker who goes on killing spree and doing ultimate madness associated with character instead they got another character study of an mentally ill man that's why the hate.. But Todd Phillips should've known people have already seen this aspect of story 5 years ago and rehasing the same old character study theme won't settle well with audience because they want something new not some old boring crap which didn't even matched the half level of the previous film.. Overall Joker 2 is a good film which completely falls flat due to uninspiring story and over the top deconstruction of the character no one wanted at the first place it was a step backwards instead of going forward after setting up a good ending in the last one.. WB should have focused on the real sequels that fans want like MoS 2, JL 2, WW 3 etc instead they wasted 200m dollars at something which shouldn't have existed in the first place...Typical bad WB move. Lol."
2.0,12 October 2024,"I am so tired of Hollywood deciding a film has the potential to become the next big multi-movie cash cow. JOKER either should have been a stand alone. Or they should have come up with a way of making a tv series that looked at Jokers around the multiverse. Preferably the one off.

Returning to Phoenix's version and then adding Harley-even if the divine GAGA-is just WB attempting to make sure fire profit. But it is not a repeatable formula, and it is VERY FORMULAIC.

I always thought that the first film of the Phoenix Joker was little more than a happy accident. And not the kind that should be repeated."

Gaga ruins the storyline and it would be much better if this movie isn't a musical. The previous sequel way better. I don't enjoy at all watching this movie.

Not relatable dramatic and very boring movie.

Absurd, please next movie don't bring gaga into this project. She is just too much singing and it's really boring I don't know enjoy her voice. I would prefer if you can focus on the storyline than musicsl. Uuugh I don't like her voice.

1.0,18 October 2024,"Okay, first of all this was not a bad film. But it was also not the film the fans of the first feature would expect as a sequel. It was a completely different approach that went too far and pissed people off. Yes, also I could have done without the musical numbers, especially those dream sequences. Yes it took away a lot from the film's gritty and bleak tone - which was still there, but it was difficult to take it as seriously as the first part. That was an ambitions approach by Todd Phillips to do something comepltely new and inspired but this failed. The rest did not fail.

It was still a dark psychological drama (maybe this time more a drama than a thriller but that does not hurt) about shizophrenia. It was also a good court room drama with a nice twist. I liked that part. I think its like they sang in the film ""Lets get people for what they came from"" which the movie did not if you expect a 1:1 sequel of the first one, but it was still good to bring the story forward into a new direction (and no I am not linking to the , again misleading musical numbers but from a thriller to a character drama. Also I thinbk people were expecting a completely different dynamic between the characters Joker and Harley Quinn.

Performance wise it was good. I loved Joaquin Phoenix who came close to his performance in the first part. He was tremendous. There were many moments that would again bring him back to awards season, if the film would not have been such a (unjustified) ciritical failure. He was really amazing and alone for Phoenix' performance people should go and appreciate the film.

Also Lady Gaga was great. She probabyl could have digged a bit deeper into that character (but there the screenplay failed), but she did most of it and I really liked her last scene, very good performance. Catherine Keener and Brendan Gleason were serveable but underused. I think it waill be the last Joker film we saw and maybe thats for the best ( I never thought the first one needed a sequel) but it really should go down as one of the film that carries one of Joaquin Phoenix' finest performances."

Well, elements of the new film are certainly quirky and stylish and depressing again, I didn't quite believe the characters journeys come the end of the film. The songs got a bit irritating as well. I

I was surprised how early reviews if the film came out. Weeks before it opened. It set my expectations low so perhaps my 6 out of 10 is skewed.

I did enjoy some of the film largely thanks to the acting quality but left not wanting to see it again which never a good sign, but I do recommend others see it and make their own mind up..."

7.0,17 October 2024,Now I don't hate this movie as much as most people do. It wasn't as great as the first movie but that's a difficult bar to pass let alone meet. I liked that it was more focused on the trial and Arthur's experience in the mental hospital. I didn't mind MOST of the singing but I felt that if they reallllly wanted it to be a musical they could have cut like 3 of Gaga's songs and it wouldn't have felt so repetitive. Joaquin did a phenomenal job while Gaga did..ok I guess? Not even to be a jerk but her lip filler was very distracting. The lawyer representing Arthur also did a phenomenal job while I felt whoever played Harvey Dent looked too young and snobby. I didn't enjoy his performance at all. The ending definitely...ended the movie that's for sure. I have a mixed opinion on whether it felt earned and sufficient but right now I'm leaning towards yes. Definitely a bit jarring. The potrayal of Harley Quinn was new but not as captivating as Joker in the first movie. Maybe this falls to Gaga's mediocre acting but it also may have been the script. I went into it thinking it was going to be dumpster fire based on all the reviews and memes but again I really don't think it was that bad!

3.0,5 October 2024,"Honestly, it's one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It's sad to see the average person cannot appreciate art, deviations from the Hollywood norm, etc. I think the combination of musical, the acting, even lady Gaga and all the rest was a brilliant combination. BUT.. people cannot comprehend the depths this movie really has, and that's why we getting more and more standardized Hollywood movies and sameness because the average person lacks the capacity to comprehend what they do not understand... Sad but true. I salute the actors, the director, the art crew and the whole team. I would like to see more movies and directors being bold and daring but humakind isn't ready it seems :("
6.0,5 October 2024,"The image, photography, lighting, sound, colors, scenery, shots, symbols, focuses and blurs, interpretations, costumes, makeup and production are MAGNIFICENT. Explosive scenes both in their metaphor and literality, an amazing control of shading, lighting and color, which together with the photography, encourage and solidify my beliefs as to why this footage is an audiovisual marvel. Apart from this, the original plot feels almost empty, the only character I managed to empathize with was the dwarf who had lost his job (which is cool because he's a great character but in the first movie I was able to empathize in a certain moment with The Joker and his mother).

The script is so basic that it is not even decent, lacking all that brilliance with which they showed off in the originality of the shots and symbols of abundant moral meaning. The film also fails to have a clear main reflection, no matter how good or entertaining the moments of the songs are, which are vaguely calming and in my opinion they put too much. Furthermore, the ending did not leave me wanting more, or even satisfied. At all. I was expecting a Joker madly in love with Harley, and of course they put him in, because he was already crazy before. The bad thing is that when he falls in love, the character loses all kinds of mischief, insight, and especially his instinct, one of the qualities that made this character such a charismatic icon.

I liked it, undeniably; there were parts that I didn't enjoy as much as I would have liked, and they almost seemed tiresome, but the film kept its pace relatively well and it is worth seeing, especially for the tremendous performance of the aforementioned Joaquin Phoenix. He demonstrated, without a doubt, all the professionalism he possesses and how versatile he is.

Conclusion & overall: underrated recommended movie. It's worth seeing and enjoying it without taking into account the first footage, because instead of giving you the somber vision that you expected from a story like this, so real and so painfully human, they decorate it with songs that, at least in my opinion, are half left over, if not almost all of them.

For more reviews like this one, don't forget to follow. Thanks.

Sincerely, biggest 446."
3.0,5 October 2024,"The new *Joker* movie was an absolute letdown. From the beginning, it felt like there was no clear direction or purpose, almost as if the filmmakers threw a bunch of ideas together without any thought of coherence or meaning. The plot seemed to meander aimlessly, and the character development was incredibly weak. It lacked the depth and nuance you'd expect from a film that is supposed to delve into the psyche of such an iconic character. Instead, it felt like a waste of time, with scenes that dragged on without any real impact or significance. The whole movie lacked substance, and by the end, it felt like nothing had been achieved. It left me wondering what the point of the entire film even was. I wouldn't recommend it."
6.0,5 October 2024,"The movie jumps from being a fantastic dissection and continuation of the first movie... To a truly tone-deaf musical which completely destroys the dark and sombre tones built by the rest of the plot.

I understand the intention of using the musical scenes as a motif for Arthur's further descent into psychosis, but they feel so out of place that they mostly serve to break the immersion of the audience.

The decision for the sequel to a dark, gritty, and depressing psychological thriller about a mentally ill man (and the society that failed to care for him, though the second never addressed this to the same degree as the first) to feature energetic big band musical sequences is so truly BAFFLING to me.

I can't help but be frustrated by this movie. It feels like every time I was invested in a scene, the tension that was carefully built was immediately trainwrecked as Phoenix or Gaga spontaneously broke out into song, and I feel like hurling the closest object at the screen out of annoyance as I'm immediately brought out of Arthur's plight.

I wish we could've seen this movie without these scenes."

7.0,8 October 2024,"If you're searching for a cure for insomnia, this film might be your best bet. Joker 2 promises a deep dive into the minds of Gotham's darkest characters but instead takes us on a meandering stroll through unremarkable and pedestrian cityscapes that could be anywhere, not the Gotham we know. The direction is as listless as the plot, with scenes dragged out beyond reason and no urgency or intensity to the story. Gotham isn't menacing or dark-it's just any old city, stripped of the gritty, malignant personality that usually defines it. Watching, I immediately wished Heath Ledger's Joker could burst onto the screen to breathe life into this lackluster version.

Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga put in the work, but even their solid performances can't save the film from itself. The few bursts of action were teased in the trailer, so don't expect anything fresh. It's as if the director decided to turn Joker into a two-hour waiting room with mood music. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. Don't waste your time, see The Substance to be mesmerized by Demi, or Strange Darling for a bit of sadistic fun."

2.0,11 October 2024,"Watching *Joker 2* was like taking a bite of a delicious-looking sandwich only to find out the middle is just air. Sure, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga brought their A-game with their acting and surprisingly impressive vocals, especially Phoenix. Gaga's Harlequin album is a treat, and the film's visuals are definitely eye-candy. The twist at the end? Oh, it did a cartwheel over our expectations and hinted at more stories to come. But did I enjoy it? I think the jury's still out.

Now, let's talk pacing-or lack thereof. There were high notes like the courtroom drama and Phoenix's performances, but in between, we had enough filler to rival a Thanksgiving turkey. Sophie Dumond and Puddles could've held the show together if the story had just let them. Instead, we got Harleen Quinzel, who was basically given a cameo instead of a character arc. Seriously, you don't cast Gaga and then make her sing in the shadows! And Arthur Fleck? His character development was more like character ""stallment."" The movie dangled the promise of growth or spectacular downfall, only to leave us hanging with a poetic non-resolution. As a metaphor, it works. As a satisfying story? Not so much."
3.0,7 October 2024,"This movie was so deeply over-hated just because people didn't know what they were going to see. This was a beautiful movie that made me cry, the music was phenomenal, the writing was so well-done, I couldn't have asked for more. The story was deep and the decline in media literacy is leaving DC ""dude-bros"" confused and angry because they don't understand the meaning of the metaphors or just simply don't care enough to think about it. This movie was absolute cinema, 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it again, this was a very emotional and exciting movie for me and I couldn't have been happier. The people mad about it being a musical completely missed the symbolism and this movie was always marketed as a musical, people just saw ""Joker"" and decided they knew exactly what it was (and we're all wrong) without reading anything about it, the music was beautiful and it was such good representation of Arthur and Lee's mindset and fantasy they built."

I will say lady Gaga and Joaquin did a good job playing their roles, but the entire movie was ruined by the musical aspect of this film. I appreciate trying to be different and go in a different direction, but this movie sucked. It's over powered by the singing which leaves the entire story plot with a million holes in it. I wish every other scene wasn't a song. I could've dealt with a song or two, but not the entire movie. This movie fell short & never recovered. I wish I would've just seen the first one and never tried to watch the second one, what a mess. Again, I do appreciate trying to be different & show Arthur's struggles in a different perspective and view point, but it just made the entire film messy, confusing & wanting me wish the movie would just end. It had so much potential and it just didn't deliver."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Having watched Joker: Folie A Deux, the critique makes so much sense, but so does all the praise. While I totally get the outrage and disappointment of the audience with this one, this much anticipated sequel of the award-winning 2019 banger is by no means a trash or a waste, not even close, and I'll tell you why Joker 2 is not as bad as people say!

It is not Todd Philips' failure, but sheer bravery to chalk out this movie like he did, when it could have been so different and so much more, in so many ways. I mean no one would remotely think of filming a psychotic drama as a musical, given the amount of constraints one would face in execution, but Todd did; and mind you, he not just did it, he outsmarted me, pulling me in for something I was not ready for.

Joaquin, capitalizing on a commendable support from Gaga, blew it out of the park as he makes it increasingly difficult for me to take my eyes off him at many points! He continues to do full justice to the fractured soul of Arthur Fleck who still struggles to find and justify his true identity amidst the chaos of the past and the present. Gaga was a delight to watch as well!

So what accounts for the mass disappointment?

This is one hell of a difficult movie to absorb along with its cinematic intricacies. NOT EVERYBODY WILL LIKE IT. If you CANNOT catch and appreciate the subtle nuances that Todd and Joaquin navigate through the entirety of the movie's duration, you WILL NOT appreciate the beauty of the movie.

I feel that a good majority of Indian audience and ""moviegoers"" is just not ready for Joker 2.

Oh and talking of beauty, some shots of the movie are such treats to the eyes owing to a masterful cinematography.

While the loaded and very frequent songs, music, and dance might annoy you (and remind you of a typical bollywood low-grade romance drama), it is well-executed for two reasons - first, the songs! The music (including the background score) is wonderful. Second, the music-movie-integration! If you pay attention to all songs played throughout, you will see how they couple magically to the elements of the movie, and to fragments of Arthur's soul, as they depict the characters' voice, both figuratively and literally. However, there is no denying that the loaded musical element kind of takes away the spark that this movie ""could have"" ignited otherwise.

Joker and Joker 2 take two very different paths to approach the same goal - The Character of Joker, and it is this difference that needs to be acknowledged, and respected. While the prequel prepared the audience for a banger with its gritty, dark and psychotic approach, the sequel seeks to bring home the central study of character, delved only more deeply this time, via a musical (again, that's brave!), but that doesn't mean we have to hate it. While the benchmark set by the first movie was just too damn high, the sequel has its own subtleties that MUST be appreciated. Again, its not just a musical that happens to be a sequel (or vice-versa), but its a good musical sequel.

So why did I call it Joker 1.5?

That's because a sequel is something you need but this, I feel, is not a movie we necessarily needed. It is more of an offshoot that picks up right after the events of the first movie and then builds upon it. However, even though we didn't need it, I am glad they made it; that's exactly why its not a waste. If anything, it only navigates the character of Joker more profoundly and gives us deeper insights into how Arthur percieves himself. As the movie progressed, I found myself INSIDE Arthur's struggle of finding himself and not just being a spectator; that's exactly where the movie succeeded, that's exactly where Joaquin succeeded (what an astonishing actor!) - in involving and capturing the audience in his own chaos.

Its Joker 1.5 because while the Joker (the idea of it) is now out there in the world (with a profound influence on the masses), Arthur still finds himself very much confined and fractured within himself.

And so the movie artfully brings out (yet again) the central idea that the Joker is not one man, its a concept, an idea! Arthur Fleck emerges as merely a conduit in whom that idea was born - all of that garnished with exceptional performance, great music, and a spectacular cinematography.

What didn't work out was the unfulfillment of people's high expectations from the villain of Gotham, and obviously some structural and executional defects here and there in the movie; so much could have been so much better in so many ways. While the first half is still something you feel captivated by, the second half gradually makes you vulnerable to the idea of hating the movie.

Therefore, it is only with a patient acknowledgement of cinematic nuances of Joker 2 that you will appreciate this well-made sequel which struggles a lot to live up to its prequel, and could have been far better, but it isn't."
10.0,6 October 2024,"A complete waste of time and money on this movie in the theater. Who thought it was a good idea to switch the genre to a musical, and why sing every five minutes? I don't understand why they had to change the genre of the movie. The plot makes no sense at all; I have no idea what's going on. The plot just starts, and then what happens? They start singing. Five more words, and they sing again. Another 10 minutes, and they're singing once more. To give you an idea, they sang about 40 times in an hour, and I'm not exaggerating. Who came up with this nonsense? The worst movie I've ever seen. I don't recommend watching it."

Joker : Folie à Deux leaves much to be desired. The plot is fragmented and hops from ""reality"" to a strange universe regularly which makes it difficult to follow.

Then there's the singing. I'd have previously rated Lady Gaga in the ""good singer's"" category but I'm not sure what's happened to her here. Both Joker and Harley regularly flit into very badly written, badly timed and badly sung music.

It's a Lady Gaga ego trip. The entire thing is shot either within a court room or a prison and is extremely dark - leaving you very depressed when it's over!"

Sit there for 2 very long hours with weird scenes that showcase the life story of a lonely man who becomes unlonely with lady Gaga. In short the girl no longer speaks to me and I lost money on some pretty expensive tickets. It's just weird with so much potential lost from the first movie and to simply finish as it did is just off. It is really disappointing and enough has been said about it online.

It's a musical, good music, weird scenes, anti climatic."
8.0,6 October 2024,"My pros and cons about the movie,

Pros -Photography, lightning. It's beautiful, and one the redeeming qualities of this movie.

Cons

-The plot. There is none. It's not telling a story, or an interesting one at least. While you know that there is growth on Joaquin's character, it doesn't makes sense, there is no real development, and as most elements in the movie it feels forced.

-Length. The movie is unnecessarily long - there are no interesting dialogs, nothing that justifies its. To me, this boils down to poor editing. A sequence of a character walking to a jury stand takes over a minute, with no reason of being there, no purpose at all. What a waste of talents and resources.

-The music. I knew it was a musical, and I actually enjoy them. Also, I used to like Lady Gaga's singing. But singing is so forced. Whenever the movie gives a glimpse of coherence, your ears start getting abused by the unnecessary, odd singing. Just because you have a singer in the cast, doesn't mean that you have to make her sing every time she comes into the screen. It felt like a hook or promo for LG, or a long music video that no one ask to see.

Overall I feel bad for all of the people that work hard into making such a movie, the actors, extras, production, even investors - they are all doing their best. But not even Joaquin Phoenix can save such a mess of a movie."
3.0,7 October 2024,"This movie had a point to make and it made it. The negative reviews are proof of that.

Those who did not enjoy Joker: Folie a Deux are a combination of people upset that they got tricked into watching a musical and people overly obsessed with the iconography of The Joker to a point that they don't realize that this movie is a character study and they are the antagonist. People who say that Todd Philips insulted his own fans here are right. In my opinion Philips was likely disturbed that people revelled in the success of his portrayal of a mentally ill man whom they were meant to feel sympathy for in the former film. The sequel rectifies that.

I also think people are upset that the film fails to create a proper martyr out of Arthur Fleck, which again is the whole point.

I will add I think it would have done a-lot better has the subtitle been ""a musical"" as it seems many did not get the memo."
3.0,6 October 2024,"The first Joker left me speechless. It was so emotional, dark and intense that I expected the sequel to be just as good, but I was very disappointed. There is no story at all. Most of the time they just sing and dance and the complex character of Harley is completely lost in this mess of a movie. It's clear that all those musical scenes are only happening in Arthur's head, but they take over the storyline and add nothing to the plot. Joachim Phoenix is beyond amazing but even his acting couldn't save the film. Gaga is good at what she does best - which is sing and dress up in cool outfits, but she didn't do the character justice and her role didn't feel important enough. I found myself thinking ""why is she even there?"" The only part that I enjoyed were the last 10 minutes of the film which are surprising, though in a way also very disappointing. I give it 5/10 just because of Phoenix."
3.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux attempts to blend musical elements with psychological drama, but the execution often cuts the pacing. The musical numbers occasionally work, but more often than not, they disrupt the flow, leaving the audience in my theater dreading each one as they appeared. It's a puzzling choice, especially since it felt like the film's target audience wasn't suited for this musical direction.

Arthur's relationship with Harley feels underdeveloped, and the progression was predictable, offering little emotional impact. Each scene between them felt like it was building toward something deeper, but ultimately, it just led to ""one more song."" The chemistry between them, while not terrible, lacked the complexity and tension that could have driven their dynamic further.

The tone stayed consistent with the first film heavy-handed and occasionally oppressive. There was less of the classic violence often associated with Joker, which I didn't particularly mind, but the film's messaging still felt forceful and lacked nuance.

The third act is where the film finally comes alive, albeit briefly. Here, we start to see some character progression, particularly in how the two worlds have always coexisted. There's a shift that hints at a deeper message about society's celebration of grifting and deception, though it's not fully explored. The fading paint on Arthur's face, symbolizing the gradual dissolution of his facade, was a nice touch one of the few visual details that added depth to the story.

In the end, much like the first Joker, Folie à Deux falls short. The musical aspect, while occasionally helpful, mostly gets in the way of the already thin story. Despite some good performances, particularly in the songs, and a stronger third act, the film doesn't offer the depth or complexity needed to truly resonate."
4.0,6 October 2024,"I left disappointed and angry that I spent money on this movie with no storyline, bad acting, music moments shoved in your face that left the whole audience mumbling, focus on Gaga's bad acting and ""character"".

Joker was played ok but the acting felt disconnected and phoned-in in a couple of scenes.

You wait for the story/action/anything frankly to begin, and the movie ends with them separated. She dumped him after trying to sell to us this ""perfect"" love story, with a pregnancy scare, chain smoking and a lot of songs more suitable for rom-com, all while only talking 4 minutes the whole movie.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one! Some walked out in the middle!"
8.0,14 October 2024,"Is it advertising for Lady Gaga ?😀 sad...so sad. Will keep in my memory only first Joker, and will try to forget second part, as I never saw it in my life.

From the deep psychological movie they create musical drama)) where there is no feelings and no emotions. You don't believe anything in the movie. Neither the characters' feelings, nor their love. I didn't even understand what kind of movie I watched? Is this really Joker??? I can't believe!!!

I am very disappointed. There is an unpleasant, sad aftertaste. How could you ruin all the memories of the first part of the film. Sad...so sad. Disappointed 💔"

3.0,11 October 2024,"I love a good musical truly m, I was a theater kid growing up, but by the end I swear I almost let out a Shrek ""stop singing!"" scream. This movie was weird and not in a good way. The plot felt all over the place and I mean this in the worst way possible, this felt like Law and Order SVU and Prison Break if they were shot as a Glee episode. Picture the Grey's Anatomy singing episode, just not needed and no one asked for it. Felt patched together with the songs and the plot felt so unorganized. The only reason I am giving this movie a 3 is because like the first one, I think the showcase mental illness very well. I thought this with the first movie, Joaquin Phoenix isn't my favorite Joker but the way he portrays him is very thoughtful and I appreciate that. Also Lady Gaga was fine she isn't my favorite actress and I think this felt off. Ranking very low on my Harley Quinn list. Anyway I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end so I would recommend wasting money to see in theaters."
1.0,10 October 2024,"This sequel is a disappointment in several ways.

While the first film showed some good psychological depth, this one misses that target. At times, I wondered where this film was going.

Once again, the two principles in this film prove they can act, but show only so-so singing talent.

The cuts from reality to imagination do show some directorial creativity, but left me without much empathy for the characters. All too often the cuts were nothing more than scenes to ""fill out' the two hours needed for this film.

The story line leaves a lot to be desired and has an ending that, quite frankly, left me cold."
1.0,14 October 2024,"In her portrayal of Harley Quinn, Lady Gaga perfectly embodies the audience's shifting feelings toward the Joker-initially captivated, but ultimately left deeply unimpressed and disappointed.

Joaquin Phoenix plays the Joker well, but so he should, as it's a repeat of the first movie. There seems to be no character development, and whenever there's a chance for the character to evolve, the character regresses, leaving the audience frustratingly stuck on a merry-go-round, helplessly wishing to escape the asylum-the theater-the Joker inhabits.

The Joker should not have tried to sing his way into our hearts, but should rather have let us live happily with the memory of the first movie. I guess all good things must come to an end, and this is a painful one."
10.0,6 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was a major letdown. The film tried to blend genres, but the result felt forced and chaotic. The musical numbers, while ambitious, disrupted the flow and often felt out of place, detracting from the dark themes that should have been explored more deeply.

Joaquin Phoenix delivered a strong performance, but even he couldn't save the muddled script and inconsistent character development. The supporting cast, including Lady Gaga, felt underutilized, leaving me wishing for more depth and interaction.

Overall, the film lacked the emotional weight and psychological complexity that made the first ""Joker"" so compelling. Instead, it came off as a confusing spectacle that failed to resonate. It seemed more concerned with style over substance, leaving me frustrated and unsatisfied by the end."
1.0,7 October 2024,"I can understand why this may not be what people were expecting it to be. In my opinion it was very well done and very interesting and entertaining. Lady Gaga absolutely crushed it in her performance. Joaquin Phoenix is great playing the role of a man tettering on the brink of sanity and insanity, as well as what is real and what isn't. I think it is the perfect story arc for The Joker. I also really enjoyed the cinematography as well as the musical numbers. Again I get why not everyone is going to like it, but I do not get the hate for it either. I strongly encourage you to see it for yourself."
4.0,4 October 2024,"I know Lady gaga is a singer n love to sing, BUT IS WAS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING. Probably 20 30 songs she sang? Come'on, it is not a concert, we like to joker finally have become a devil n lead those hopeless people, but the end.... TF? I know it is more based on his pathetic life, too difficult to be changed his personality. But we can do better than that right?? I am so regret to buy D-box for this, the whole movie tried puting me in sleep, when Gaga moved her lips I did pray: please , no more singing no more singing and weird dancing, please show us some we expected to watch! Then she just kepting going n going.

I am not gonna eat dinner tonight."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Imagine somebody cast Usain Bolt and makes him run in every scene we see him! That's exactly how I felt, every single scene that you see Lady Gaga she's singing or she'll eventually sing! There's no story, there's no strong script! It's not a movie it feels more like a show case for Jacquin Phonix and Lady Gaga to show people how good they are and indeed Jacquin Phonix rocket it again! He's an incredible actor but that is not enough to keep people in the cinema if things make no sense! Even though there was a huge potential to take the viewers deeper.

Shoutout to Lawrence Sher with, great visuals, great lightning!"
1.0,5 October 2024,"After the last Joker being huge, I had high hopes and was looking forward to seeing it. I've am so dissappointed in the overall presentation. More of a musical which ruined the flow of the film, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady GaGa were great as Arthur and Quinn, but it was like watching a star is born with the Joker. After watching till the end, you will be left scratching your head and thinking why? It was a great depiction of someone's decent into madness, but it sadly was a huge Mishmash of courtroom drama, misplaced musicals to remind us that Lady Gaga is in this movie and a great depiction of a classic character."
1.0,5 October 2024,
9.0,6 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" is, in many ways, an unnecessary sequel that never should have existed, reflecting the greed of a Hollywood studio seeking awards and box-office profits. I entered the theater with low expectations and reluctance, despite loving the original, mainly due to the inclusion of musical numbers, which could easily fall flat as they don't fit the tone. Surprisingly, the first hour entertained me, and I thought, ""Well, it's not as good as the original, but it's not as bad as I expected,"" even with the evident excess of songs. However, my optimism was misplaced as that initial positive impression quickly crumbled as the film dragged on without any clear direction.

The movie stretches on to the point where it feels repetitive, with most scenes taking place in the prison and courtroom, locations that quickly become tiresome and lacking in visual or narrative innovation. There was nothing impactful, no personal drama that made me want to engage with the story. ""Joker 2"" stalls more than a poorly rolled joint that never lights as it should.

Another major issue lies with the characters. The Joker, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, appears here as a hollow version of himself. There is no emotional or psychological development that does justice to the character's complexity. While the first film showcased a downward spiral culminating in violence and chaos, here, the Joker lacks life and purpose. He moves slowly, directionless, as if lost within the plot. For such an iconic character, this is unforgivable.

Lady Gaga is an excellent actress and singer, but she didn't convince me as Harley Quinn. The problem isn't her talent, which is undeniable, but rather the writing surrounding her character, which fails to make her memorable. In my opinion, this is the worst portrayal of Harley Quinn, wasting her talent, especially considering what Lady Gaga is capable of.

Technically, there's nothing to criticize about ""Joker 2."" The cinematography, art direction, and sound are all impeccable, which only makes it more frustrating that the film offers nothing new narratively and, worse, leads us nowhere. Ultimately, it feels like a parade of stylized scenes and cliched lines, designed for sharing on Tumblr.

One last thing: the $200 million budget is a mystery. Where did all that money go? The film mostly takes place in the same settings, lacking significant action moments or special effects to justify such an investment. I got the impression that most of that budget went to Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's salaries because, honestly, there's not much else to justify it.

As for the musical moments I dreaded, I have to admit they turned out better than I expected, but that doesn't mean they work well. They often feel forced, as if hastily inserted to give the film a different identity, but they end up disrupting the pace and, in many cases, making the experience even more tedious.

In summary, ""Joker 2"" can be visually stunning and technically charming, but it's ultimately a completely unnecessary and weak sequel. It adds nothing new to the universe that the first film so effectively built and stands as another example of a terrible continuation of a great film, much like ""American Psycho 2."" Its existence, like the narrative it presents, simply lacks purpose."

1.0,6 October 2024,"Joker 2 was one of my most anticipated movies this year. The previews looked fantastic and thought this had the potential to be the best movie of the year. After seeing it today, it is battling Last Jedi for worst movie of all time.

What a miserable film. It's basically watching a guy get treated terribly by everyone and I mean everyone. This film tries to punish him for his crimes to the point where the film itself is punishing him. It's like taking your least favorite toy and giving it nothing because you somehow hate it so much.

The previews never advertise that it's a musical. Anything that resembles a musical is shown them on stage but nothing that will help you to that conclusion. I mean, I heard people walking out of the theater that they didn't know it was a musical.

Some of these musical numbers are hit and miss, mostly miss and thankfully they are mostly performed in Joker's head. However, I start to realize the lack of story and these musical numbers are not only out of place and unnecessary, they are merely there to pad out the runtime.

As usual, The Phoenix Brother delivered well for his 50 million dollar paycheck along with Lady Gaga. Brenden Gleason as the warden is also wonderful. The movie was also shot well. These are the only positives I can think of that kept me from scoring this film a one.

It's just that it felt like a film that simply exists because the studio wanted another sequel this creating a Matrix Resurrections effect where everyone involved was either to spiteful to make this or too fearful of its target audience."

I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life and a decent amount of money out of my pocket. Is it just me or is Hollywood getting dumber and dumber by the year? It's either they're running out of material or they're hiring the wrong people to direct and write movies I would understand had the original joker been a musical but why in the hell was the sequel one and what in the hell were they thinking, if you were a fan of the joker movie, I highly recommend you do not waste your time with this one."

From all the ideas they could've implemented the whole movie is just clownery full of songs and songs and songs and jesis not even one fight scene or cars flying or bombs or guns like what in the world was going on in that movie guys because im still trying to understand what was the main aim or objective of that nonsense."

The widely hated musical parts just fit the old original joker in my opinion. And anyone who misses a captivating linear storyline doesn't get the extraordinary psychological development and plot in which Arthur stops to identify with his made up personality of the joker who he created in his search for love and meaning in life and realizes that the interest of society in him limit to the mask he created for himself and excludes his real personality."

2.0,5 October 2024,"The whole storyline is a great follow-up of the previous movie. It has/had a lot of potential for a next movie and restart of the whole gotham series. But the singing ruined it in my opinion. I get that sometimes the singing enhances the look of the mind of Arthur fleck. But i am missing the ""sometimes"". People left he cinema early, and i can't blame them. The singing was getting way to annoying.

This was an absolutely frustrating movie experience that segways in, and out of, awful and uwanted musica scenesl that are equally marred by a ridiculous mess of a plot. Not only does the musical aspect distract the viewer, it manages to irritate them as well. If, and i mean a big if, but if the musical portion was what the director used to add another dimension to the psychotic descent of the Joker into madness or the coping mechanisms of the Arthur Fleck to find his voice, why make that into a muscial which by the premise of the charaters insanity, will only serve to alienate the viewer. I almost walked out in the middle of it and, given what I saw throughout, I wished I had. Give us the real Joker 2, not this nonsense."
10.0,5 October 2024,"I am an absolute DC and Joker fan. But this movie is by far the worst DC movie of all time and one of the most annoying movies of the last years. How can a movie studio in Hollywood approve a movie like this? There's a lot of pointless and boring singing and the plot and ending are a disaster. The whole story of Joker as we know it is simply changed here. You hope in vain that the Joker will finally develop into the Joker you know and admire him for. I loved the first Joker movie and couldn't wait to see the sequel. But when I found out that they had turned it into a musical, the joy was gone again. Unfortunately, I still went to the movies hoping that it wouldn't be so bad. However, it was much worse than I could have imagined. I used to love Lady Gaga, but in this movie, with all the stupid singing, she was just annoying.

What they should have done is have Arthur Fleck escape Gotham City with the help of minions and set up a criminal empire in some other city and then make his way back to Gotham leading the underworld of crime. Imagine a more ruthless Joaquin Phoenix as a fully evolved Joker with no traces of Arthur Fleck left. He stabs people who disobey him, he sets others on fire, anything to show how criminally insane and ruthless he is. Instead, they water him down and show he is still Arthur wrapped up in a mushy love story. A wasted opportunity by the Director. Imagine if they went this route instead and then cut to scenes if young Bruce Wayne at Wayne Manor putting his fingers in his mouth and making a smile and remembering his encounter with Arthur or something cool like that. Having Lady Gaga in this film and making it a musical is what ultimately ruined it and stunted its creativity. Arthur Fleck as The Joker had way more character depth and intrigue than they showed in this sequel and that's why this movie fails."

Comparing Joker 1 to Joker 2 is like comparing an intense psychological thriller to a never-ending, cringe-inducing high school musical.

It was an absolute snore fest.

As each song started, you could hear the audience murmur, ""Oh god, here we go again..."" because they knew exactly what was coming: more awkward, breathy attempts at talk-singing.

It was like watching someone sing-speak their way through a bad break-up monologue, except it never ended.

Was there supposed to be a story?

The worst part? Every time you thought they might get back on track, another random musical number would pop up out of nowhere. It's like the film was trying to be a serious, edgy follow-up to *Joker 1*, but somewhere along the way, they decided, ""You know what this needs? More jazz.""

My favorite part of the entire film was when we walked out."
3.0,5 October 2024,"Scott Silver and Todd Phillips knew what they were risking when they scripted 'Joker: Folie à Deux' the way they did. The film also directed by Phillips 5 years ago enjoyed immense success with the public and critics, received 11 Academy Awards nominations and 2 statuettes. Part of the secret to its success was that it fit well into the Gotham mythology and expanded and enriched the Joker character. The screenwriters of this sequel made two decisions: they made the continuation of the story into a musical and returned the Joker character to the human dimensions of the tormented Arthur Fleck. The first decision was inspired, but the second was a surprise and disappointment to the masses of viewers for whom Gotham is an entire universe in which the Joker is one of the brightest stars. Most fan reactions have been devastating. But I'm not one of the fans of movies inspired by comics, I liked the original 'Joker' for its complexity of the characters, acting and its visual power, so this sequel had no many reasons to disappoint me. Moreover, the musical adaptation and the casting of Lady Gaga as Joker's partner delighted me. I enjoyed 'Joker: Folie à Deux' almost as much as the first film.

The beginning of the film is delicious: a cartoon that basically recaps what happened in the past and introduces the Joker to the very few who wouldn't know the character. From Disney-style animation, we move to realism and reality. Arthur Fleck, imprisoned on an island connected to Gotham by a long and winding bridge awaits his judgment among the inmates, overseen by cruel guards - sometimes sadistic, sometimes falsely friendly. A ray of light appears when, as part of a music re-education program, he meets Lee Quinzel, a girl who introduces herself as a childhood neighbor and tells him about a past almost as unhappy as his own. Is there still hope for the death penalty threatened murderer of five (or maybe six) victims? Arthur's lawyer prepares a defense based on split personality: the evil Joker would take over the peaceful Arthur who is innocent of the crimes he is accused of. But are Arthur and Joker two different personalities? Ultimately, the admiration of the crowds who made of him a vigilante idol and especially the love of Lee are for the Joker and not for Arthur. It will all play out at the trial, but what we're about to see is very different from any courtroom drama we've seen on screen before.

The formidable cinematography is signed by Lawrence Sher, with whom Todd Phillips already collaborated on the first 'Joker'. The collaboration with the Icelandic composer Hildur Guðnadóttir also continues, and the role of music is amplified by the fact that we are dealing with a musical. In fact, the songs are not only aesthetic interludes, but also play an important role in fleshing out the relationship between Joker and Lee. They are mostly taken from what Americans call their great songbook, hits from the '50s or '60s, many taken from other musicals. I'm a big fan of both Lady Gaga (as an actress) and Joaquin Phoenix and their presence together made 'Joker: Folie à Deux' a treat for me. Phoenix went to physical extremes to get into the role. I also noted Brendan Gleeson's performance as the security guard who guards and escorts the Joker. The film can be criticized for its length and some repetitions that could have been avoided, but this is an almost universal disease of Hollywood productions nowadays. In the first 'Joker' movie we witnessed the transformation of Arthur Fleck into the Joker. In 'Joker: Folie à Deux' he is brought back to his human dimensions. But what the crowds loved about him was the character and not the man, and thus, he loses everything in the process, including the adulation of many of his movie fans. For me, however, this film was not a disappointment."
3.0,7 October 2024,"Either they ruined this by making it a talentless Rocky Horror knockoff because Lady Gaga was already planned to be in it or Lady Gaga was cast after deciding to make it a lame Rocky Horror knockoff. Now I wish Tim Curry were in his late 20s and in this because it would at least have a sense of humor to go with the ridiculousness (you know, like the Joker)

I think everyone lost the plot here or they didn't bother (or cared) to make something interesting. You know, that's worth your time much less your money.

Ever watch a really cheap old B movie? Some of them had musical/dance sequences too. Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed Up Zombies had I think 5. Ed Wood did one with almost all of it. The scenes padded out the length of the film because the plot was so thin that the movie would finish in under 50 minutes and they needed at least 70 to make it a feature. Here, your backside goes numb waiting for the drabness to end but you only get to change how you're sitting because this drags out to over 2 hours. Like a big budget version of Ed Wood's Orgy of the Dead....."
2.0,4 October 2024,"To start off, I expected a more action-driven storyline. Instead, Folie a Deux gives us High School Musical in a Gotham setting. Such a disappointment compared to the previous Joker.

This by itself was perhaps innovative from the perspective of some viewers and certainly worked in movies like Sweeny Todd with Johnny Depp. From my standpoint, it was an absolutely misguided decision that was worsened by Lady Gaga. Her portraying Harley Queen did just not appear believable. A popstar with one of the most notable voices in the world singing in an asylum choir? She did not have anything crazy about her except for trying to bring the Joker out of Arthur Fleck. Poor casting choice, there would have been so many alternatives. And the singing could have been cut short by almost every song. I strongly hope that the director never gives us a Batman movie, I already have nightmares of the Dark Night dancing like a Ballerina.

Fair play to the display of personality disorders. The theme from the cartoon in the beginning was prevalent throughout the movie.

The scenes in tue courtroom were poorly made compared to other decade-old but legendary pieces of movie history like 12 angry men."
3.0,4 October 2024,"How did Todd Phillips mess up a sequel to a billion-dollar hit like this? 'Joker: Folie à Deux' feels like a big-budget humiliation ritual that goes nowhere. Sure, it looks great, the set pieces are well done, and the music is decent. But the musical moments don't develop Joker's character-they're just there for Lady Gaga to sing, which, while she is a fantastic vocalist, really misses the mark. I wanted to see her Harley Quinn shine, to explore that infamous, chaotic romance. Instead, we got an ending that's just atrocious. Not the worst movie, but one of the most disappointing of the year. Phillips had a massive success and fumbled it, denying us the Joker and Harley mayhem we all wanted. It shouldn't have been that hard."
3.0,7 October 2024,"It's only thanks to Joaquin Phoenix that this movie got a three star rating from me. I know Gaga is an amazing actress, but it seems all she was hired for was to sing.

The movie definitely had a lot of potential if it followed more of what we saw in the first movie, but managed to be one of the worst I've ever watched.

The singing does not match the vibe of this movie and made serious scenes feel like part of a comedy. It just made no sense. Also because of the many songs there was no room to tell any kind of story. Any time something remotely interesting happened they burst out into song and I lost all track of what was happening.

Don't waste your time and money on this one."
10.0,7 October 2024,"1 out of 5 stars.

Joker 2 is a horrible musical psychological thriller film which this film was very much uncalled for. First movie depicted a raw realistic joker. This sequel took it sideways and in a horrible way.

Lets get started about the plot. Plot was thin and did not add anything besides what we saw in the first movie. Its the aftermath, Arthur imprisoned. Awaiting trial. And court sequences. A climatic escape. But to come back in full circle.

The direction was dumb. Director tried to make this a musical. Big mistake. A lot of the musical sequences is all in Arthurs head. Makes it more crazy. The musical sequences is eye rolling stupid. It literally takes up majority of the films running time. It was best to cut those sequences and keep the main plot focused.

Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are great but there performances are wasted in a script that does not build to any development. Right when it gets somewhere. It pops into a musical. Than back into something serious and another musical. Direction did not take itself seriously and the movie itself was a joke to itself. It is so boring with nothing happening in the film.

Overall, it is one of the worst films of the year and definitely not worth seeing in the big screen."

I still think Joaquin was so good but at the same time I didn't care. At a certain point I didn't want to be in the theater anymore. I wanted to go home and be doing literally anything else. Cooking toast? Watching paint dry? Even staring at my rug? I just wanted to be out of the theater.

Turning this into a musical could have maybe been cool? But certainly not In the way they did this one. I've never been more bummed about a sequel in my entire life and that's a fact.

Did they spend 200 million dollars and waste it on this crap? Yes. That kind of makes me nauseous.

Terrible movie. Terrible idea. And really a waste of time. I'm sorry."
3.0,10 October 2024,"This is just a waste of everyone's time and money.

Period. Don't even bother honestly. Well unless you're into that then you do you.

Those words should've been enough. You as the audience don't need a review, you need a warning.

But seeing as i can't submit this without sufficient characters (600) I was forced to write more about this movie

This movie is horrible.

I feel bad for Phoenix though he gave his all.

Why did it have to be musical?

Why the ending?

Why oh why was this movie made in the first place?

For what purpose?

This is the sequel we don't need AND we don't deserve, because we DEFINITELY did not ask for it.

It feels like an insult to the people who liked the first movie."
1.0,7 October 2024,"Is a Pure musical, not even attempt to innovate, keep in the same thing that the last movie, I not know other ways to said this movie is absolute bad, the Joker is chaotic and this trash of movie put it as singer, Really? How someone can literally ruin a character so bad, that literally now is a singer, not even that but Harley character portrayed by Lady trash (gaga) is a clear example of what is wrong with female characters today (no personality at all and she is strong only because she is a woman). Instead of upgrading for the first film this movie stays in the same position only that now including singing, If I have a recommendation to you, not waste your money in this."

I can't believe how much nothing happened. There was no action, no violence, no arc, no character development, no point, and no reason to have watched it. I'm mad at myself for contributing to its box office.

As I got deeper into the movie, I started to think they must be building to something huge and cathartic, but I can't stress enough when reviewing this just how much of literally nothing is going on. If you can imagine Phoenix and Gaga standing in a dim room and singing under their breath to each other, you'll pretty much have the whole experience.

I don't know how Todd Phillips' brain works, so I can't say whether my suspicion that he is just messing with the audience is accurate or not. But it definitely feels that way as the movie ploddingly lumbers up to the verge of having something happen, only for it to veer off into monotony.

And frankly, even calling it monotonous is a compliment because there's certainly an argument to be made that the movie lacks even a mono-tone. Unless you count deliberate boredom as a tone.

If an argument could be made that the last movie really didn't have anything to do with the Joker, this movie settles that issue definitively. You could take any movie, slap the word Joker on it and put some makeup onto the star's face, and it would have just as much claim to being a Joker movie as this does. If you slapped some clown makeup onto Tom Cruise and called the movie Top Gun: The Joker, it would be just as valid.

The only reason it got three stars out of me is because everyone is a good actor, doing the best they can with a painful lack of material."

Arthur Fleck completely regresses and goes back to who he was in the beginning of the first movie. It was all a front the whole time. I wasn't a fan of the story and by the end of the film was questioning why I bought a ticket.

Now with all of that said I did think that some of the musical numbers were shot well and I was impressed with Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's performance."
4.0,9 October 2024,"A Major Letdown Despite Phoenix's Performance!

Aside from Joaquin Phoenix's stellar acting, Joker 2 falls flat in almost every other aspect. The story is weak and lacks any real development, leaving you wondering what the point of it all was. The plot doesn't progress, and it feels like the film drags on with little substance.

To make matters worse, there's way too much music crammed in, which distracts from the narrative and feels unnecessary. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to cover up the lack of story with sound. Overall, a disappointing sequel that doesn't live up to the original.

Don't recommend anyone paying for this!"
8.0,4 October 2024,I wonder which geniuses thought the masterpiece of Joker's sequel to turn into a musical like bollywood quality movie. Just because of the money they milked the fans to this sequel. It's against the first movie. They just took the character and broke it. The movie is choppy like it's just choppy. Even when the movie starts a develop it ruins it with a musical and then never comes back to that momentum it was building so it never works very well. I don't think it's worth watching the movie just ruined the joker character so I don't think it's worth it. What I believe is the director saw the success of Joker one and then just thought the if we make a sequel then we make more money idea even if we make a sh** movie people just come because of the Joker one so they just milked and sucked.

Me as a watcher and i think who loved the first part is looking for the twist in the character and all the emotions and the physiologic aspects the lead to this character

if we are looking for all the factors that made joker one of the best movies Won't fond these factors again in folie à deux As it's basically musical movie .. we weren't looking for music

We were looking for deeper level of understanding joker

And that's what we hope to improve if there's any plan for joker 3 I was expecting more of WB as this movie doesn't met the standards we used to see from WB

Phoenix did a great acting and he really deliver the character well But there was a lot of distraction with music ."

Good example on how a sequel can destroy a good movie. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money. Imagine the Joker in Lalaland. They dared to make a senseless musical out of the movie. Sadly boring, no action, poor meaning. There is nothing good to say about this. You will be sitting there for more than 2 hours expecting something that is never going to happen so you rather get the money and buy ice cream. Slow paced, you will feel that the agony will slowly build up in you until you can't take it anymore."
8.0,6 October 2024,"The new Joker movie is not just a disappointment-it's an outright insult to one of the most iconic characters in the Batman universe. To take the Joker, the fattest, most vibrant, and ingenious villain, and reduce him to this level of pathetic caricature is beyond comprehension. It's almost as if the creators deliberately set out to tarnish everything that made the Joker a brilliant force of chaos.

Whoever thought this version of the Joker was a good idea should seriously reconsider their career choices. Honestly, the people behind this travesty deserve to be held accountable-maybe even jailed-for defaming such a legendary character. This film should be considered criminal for how it twists and mutilates the very essence of what makes the Joker the best of all Batman antagonists.

In short, it's a slap in the face to true Batman fans. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one."
2.0,2 October 2024,"Not surprised to see and hear the reviews about this one. I wasn't sure what I thought of ""Joker: Folie À Deux"" immediately after the screening. I did not go into it expecting a Batman film (of which I enjoy and there is no shortage of), and I enjoyed Joker but didn't love the overwhelming reactions to the character in the wake of the first film. I was surprised when, as the credits rolled, I was able to hear two middle aged men in my theater complaining about the lack of a happy ending ruining their enjoyment of the film. To their credit, their loud opinions incited this review. I'm not a critic and do not generally feel as if the world is desperately in need of my opinions, yet here we are.

The opening sequence forces you to accept that nontraditional elements will be at play. Thankfully, the use of WB's backlog is much more reverent in this film than it was in ""The Flash"". The editing is not as harshly surreal as it was in the first, and while there are edits that call into question Arthur's reliability as a narrator, the majority are generally more obvious and inspired. The cinematography and framing hits the ground running in developing both the participation and effects Phillips' version of the Gotham government and society have on the characters. This film is easily recommendable for those of us who long for more directors to be given the freedom to play with the structure and style of their films.

The plot delves into the instability in Gotham's society that Arthur is both a cause and effect of. Unlike the real world, Gotham is plagued by societal issues regarding the boxes the justice system and the media place on those in different positions in society, with the treatment of criminals and the mentally ill in the spotlight. The effects of the people who oppose and encourage their behavior are also called into question. Whether it's a prison guard or an obsessive lover, both are confident in their unique ability to justify death for those they disagree with, never acknowledging the people caught in the crossfire.

Reflecting on it, I'm not entirely sure what disappointed fans wanted to see. For fans of the IP, the first film was more of an homage to ""The King of Comedy"" with elements of the namesake character than it was a faithful retelling of a comic book story, which should have been a clue toward Phillips' direction with the sequel. For those that loved or hated the original ""Joker"" and its main character, they are free to choose a side in the film. Unfortunately there's a chance they'll miss that by identifying with and idolizing these extreme characters, the joke is on them."
3.0,15 October 2024,Soooooo bummed out!!!!!! Everytime lady gaga came on screen I knew she was about to start singing again. It had so much potential. Really really let down with the musical part. As soon as they started singing I completely lost interest in the film. I love him as an actor and I'm sure lady gaga would've been good if they gave her the opportunity but I'm completely confused as to why they turned such a great story line into a musical. Whatever they tell you in southpark about taking your woman to a musical and what happens afterwords.. completely untrue. We were both disappointed. Should've been titled Joker: the musical.
2.0,4 October 2024,"Pointless follow up. Jaquin put himself through hell to make this movie and it missed the Audience. Not at all what we were expecting and glad to see the final credits.

Nothing much else to say and 600 charectors required as a minimum beyond mybattention span after such a mundane movie. We really appreciated the pinot grigio on offer and the reclining seats at the Odeon. The thing that impressed the most this evening was that my wife Did not fall asleep during the screening. I guess in the hope that something exciting would happen. Gladiator coming up which looks like a proper job for a sequel."

Harvey dent is bizarre and very very poorly written , song choices just don't work for me whatsoever but again and again I say there is just zero story !!!! The court drama is drab as is when he's in Arkham I really thought this film would tease how the possibility of a third film with even more characters but no I doubt any will get commissioned now."

The first movie was not perfect but it is still good and it was my favourite movie of the 2019. However, this movie preferred to take all that and make a high school musical with the Joker and Lady Gaga. The main problem is not that the movie is a musical; the problem is the empty story with a slow rhythm that makes the movie feel like an eternity. Lady Gaga's perfomance is very lazy and boring like her character and Joaquin Phoenix seems zero interested in this movie. The music is very forgettable and the choreographies are poor and unexciting. Also, the worst part of this movie is the ending because it seems that the director wanted to mock his fans. This was my second disappointment of this year (the first was the crow )"
4.0,6 October 2024,"This sequel is perfectly aligned with the psychological drama explained in the first movie. The music is meaningful and aligned with internal dreams in a person who use music and TV as defense mechanism to overcome its cruel reality. This is a movie about who the society wants you to be and who you really are. This is a real-life inspired movie, not a super heroes movie. That's why is underrated from people who wanted just another fictional story. Performance from Gaga is excellent, the soundtrack will be in my favorites in the next weeks to come. Phoenix interpretation is outstanding this may be one of his best movies."
4.0,8 October 2024,"Why in the world would you turn this into a musical? Stunt casting by putting Gaga in to go after a different demographic definitely turns this movie into a completely different sequel than the one that fans of the original film were waiting for. I saw people moaning and and eventually getting up to leave after about seventy minutes. I chose to stick it out because I hoped that it would eventually redeem itself and get better. It really never did. You should go see it if you just need closure or really enjoy seeing Gaga or Joaquin Phoenix up on the big screen. Otherwise, wait until it's streaming."
1.0,8 October 2024,"To cut the story short, this movie was a dumpster fire. I feel bad for Joaquin Phoenix, such a great actor, filled them big shoes after Heath Ledger's Joker, won our hearts with a great performance (as always) just to be ruined like this and become a meme. Should've known it was gonna go this way when I've seen Lady Gaga in a trailer. Todd Phillips ruined yet another sequel/trillogy. Also the choice for this to be a musical was sooo wrong and it ruined the whole vibe set in first movie. Todd, if you wanna go musical you need a great writing (The Miserables, Sweeney Todd) which this movie just didn't have. Everyone is dissapointed and for a reason."

This was not what any of us expected. It was impossible to tell what they were going for with this movie. An edgy love story? Maybe a ""clever"", ironic reclamation of the comic book origin story? Regardless, it'll take a long while to wash out this bad taste.

At least two years too late following up on any potential successful franchise, this boring, unfunny, strange (and not in a good way) slog of a tale went nowhere. Only 20 minutes in, half of the theater began audibly groaning every time Joaquin or Gaga started singing ANOTHER of the 14 (!!) showtunes with minimal relevance. I am racking my brain trying to think who that movie was made for. It had no significance for carrying any certain plot forward nor was it entertaining as a standalone film. Joaquin and Gaga did fine in their roles, but the script, plot, and character ""development"" were all terrible.

I don't mind slow burners if there is a good plot and acting but I can't get over the singing ...

They were the only reason I stayed remotely interested and made myself finish the entire movie.

4.0,5 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is the biggest disappointment of the year. A film that should not have existed, since ""Joker"" (2019) already had a complete story of its own with many meanings.

Completely pointless and forced musical scenes, a poorly used Harley Quinn, a generic Harvey Dent, and the absence of important events are some of the main characteristics of this irrelevant film.

A film without purpose and a concrete story - covered by musical performances, in which its highlights are those that reference the first film.

Despite this, Joaquin Phoenix gives an inspired performance, and the film has good photography."
8.0,8 October 2024,"This movie does not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the first part. The only positive thing about this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's acting performance. I was so disappointed that I even made an extra account for a rating. The constant singing gets on my nerves, the whole movie theater just waits until the unnecessary musical scenes are over. The director wanted to bring in some kind of political corectnes here so as not to encourage anyone to be like the Joker. But I want to see a movie that is true to the Joker and not adapted, which is a good image for society - that the Joker gets what he deserves.

Long story short: Dont waste ur time !"

But the guys didn't absorb the feelings and emotion like we did but instead being able to critic it and find themselves somewhat disappointed. I think this is a masterpiece for the empathetic and self destructive and didn't quite quench the thirsts of those looking for a nonsensical dark comedy. I respect bother sides.

3.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux A Disappointing Musical Turn I was not excited about the musical elements in Joker: Folie à Deux from the moment they were announced. I predicted that they would be a jarring and out-of-place addition to the gritty, psychological drama that made the first film so successful. Unfortunately, my fears were confirmed.

While Joaquin Phoenix's performance remains top-notch, the musical numbers felt forced and did not contribute meaningfully to the narrative. They disrupted the film's realistic tone and detracted from the psychological depth explored in the original.

I hope that future installments of the Joker franchise will return to the gritty, psychological drama that made the first film so successful. While Folie à Deux is still a watchable film thanks to Phoenix's performance, the musical elements were a significant misstep for me."

1.0,6 October 2024,"If you thought that ""Joker 2"" could surpass the intensity of its predecessor, you are in for a big disappointment. This sequel feels more like an exercise in empty style than a meaningful continuation of the iconic villain's story.

From the beginning, the pace is tedious and scenes drag on unnecessarily, making one wonder if there is actually a purpose behind each dialogue and scene. The plot, which attempts to be deep and provocative, gets lost in its own pretension, leaving the viewer with the feeling of having seen more of the same, but without the emotional impact that one would expect.

The actors, who in theory could have contributed something interesting, seem unmotivated and their performances are flat, lacking the spark that made the first film shine. The chemistry between the characters is non-existent, making the interactions feel forced and unbelievable. Not even Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which had been previously acclaimed, manages to save this work from mediocrity. His acting, rather than being captivating, feels repetitive and lacking energy.

In short, ""Joker 2"" is a failed attempt to recapture the magic of its predecessor."
1.0,9 October 2024,"This movie had potential to be good with the talented actors casted, but the musical aspect and messy storyline was the downfall of Joker: Folie à Deux. This movie had some good moments, but when it broke out in song it felt out of place, and it just had me laughing because of how cringe it turned out to be. The first movie was a great success, and the fact that we waited 2 years to be given this for a sequel is an insult to the fanbase. I would not recommend seeing it, not even if you're a fan of musicals. This movie is a complete disappointment, it should have been an action thriller with how the last movie ended. It would have been better to see Joker become the crime boss we all know him as."

The decision to make it a musical was just the worst possible idea, but it's not the only reason the movie is terrible. The script is completely empty and doesn't make any sense, the acting is good but there isn't anything for the actors to even do besides dance around to stupid songs. I guess it's better than the thoughtless cashgrab remakes we keep getting, but it's still a remake.

Building up a character and a storyline that leads absolutely nowhere is a crushing disappointment for what had so much promise for the dark world of DC comics. Oh well. I can still enjoy the first film and pretend this abomination doesn't exist. Maybe another film will rise from the ashes that will actually make sense. A natural continuation of the first film. I'm quite let down by the need to make this film a political statement as well. I want to be entertained, not lectured. Why is quality entertainment so difficult to come by anymore."

I rarely walk out of movies because once I've paid for something I will force myself to sit through it but I couldn't take it anymore after 1 hour and 15 minutes so I just left. It's the most annoying and pointless film I can recall seeing in the 21st century. It is truly that bad.

The script and ""storyline"" is so bad that you don't care about the characters, what happened to them or anything they have to say let alone SING. The song choices are cringe worthy...""Come On Get Happy""....really? I had high hopes for this film and was one of the few people who didn't have an issue with it being a musical. Until I saw it! Jesus it's bad.

It is so boring that I had trouble even focusing because I did not care what was happening. I got up and went to the bathroom and then to the concession stand just to break the monotony. Came back and by the time I finished my popcorn and candy I felt like I had nothing to live for any longer so I just left so I could at least listen to an audiobook in my car.

Joker 2 is so bad that it has ruined my love for the first film. I will never see it the same again. I gave Joker a 10 and I'm giving this a 1 if that tells you anything. It's not ""artsy"" as some try to claim, I love artsy, but the lack of artistical value here is staggering. The script and direction is so bad that it makes every actor seem terrible...even Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Lady Gaga feels like a singer pretending to be an actress and like it's her first film. They even managed to ruin her voice.

This film is a tragedy. But not the sort of bad that can be enjoyed as a comedy. Outside of the cinematography there is nothing good about Joker 2. The joke is on the audience."

Other then that it's one time watch nothing more and i say in my opinion watch it on streaming service rather then going into the theater.

I was honestly very big fan of joker but folie à Deux isn't my cup of tea with lame songs and dragged storytelling. They could have used the story in more exciting and good way and just ending like this in a point less wayway."

10.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux was a disappointing and misguided sequel that failed to capture the magic of the original. While the first film delved deep into the psyche of a troubled individual, painting a haunting portrait of mental illness and societal decay, the sequel felt more like a shallow imitation.

The decision to incorporate a musical element was a misstep that detracted from the film's dark and gritty tone. While the musical numbers were technically well-executed, they felt out of place and disrupted the narrative flow. The juxtaposition of upbeat songs with the film's heavy subject matter created a jarring dissonance that left the audience feeling confused and disconnected.

Joaquin Phoenix delivered another strong performance as the titular character, but even his talent couldn't salvage a film that was fundamentally flawed. Lady Gaga's casting was intriguing, but her character felt underdeveloped and her singing, while impressive, didn't quite fit the world of the film.

The story itself was predictable and lacked the depth and complexity of the original. The film's exploration of mental illness felt superficial, and the ending was unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered.

In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a missed opportunity. It squandered the potential of the franchise and failed to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. Fans of the first film will likely be disappointed by this sequel, which feels more like a cash grab than a genuine attempt to continue the story."

As a follow up to the first Joaquin Phoenix movie you would think the sequel would be even better, especially considering it is about one of the greatest villains in all of comic history, but no. There is ultimately no plot. You would think the movie would be an exciting action filled villain movie, especially considering the introduction of Harley, but once again ,no.

4.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie A Deux or more appropriately Joker: F Me And You, is the single most disrespectful movie towards a character I've seen in my life. If you think I'm being hyperbolic, look at the scores I typically give, 90% of the time I give movies or shows scores it's either a 9 or 10 out of 10. This movie, however, is a special kind of disgrace.

What makes it even more frustrating, is unlike most garbage movies, this is well shot, well-acted, and has genuinely good moments in it. A courtroom scene in particular is remarkably well done. Visually, it's superb. But anytime an ounce of momentum gets built within the story, it's cut off by a stupid musical number and has to start over from square one. That happens time and time again until you can't wait for the movie to end.

When it does, you're left wondering...how did this get made? It retroactively ruins a solid first entry, does everything it can to embarrass the most iconic villain in fiction, and was somehow still pointless. It ends exactly where the movie started. If you cut the first two hours and only left us with the final scene, nothing about the movie changes, except the audience would feel less insulted."
10.0,2 October 2024,"I rarely comment on movies (almost never), but this movie is so bad that I don't even know how to describe it. There's no real plot. I expected an excellent film like the first one, but this is ridiculous. A musical with bad acting and even worse songs. The only reason I stayed in the theater was because I felt uncomfortable disturbing people to leave. Save yourself 2 hours of your time and around 20 dollars. Buy rather an icecream. I will never understand why they ruin successful titles. If the first part did well and there's no need for a second one, then just don't make it.

On the other hand, Lady Gaga actually did the best job in the entire movie. She acted well."
2.0,10 October 2024,"I'm fed up of reading all the bad reviews. I like lots of different genres of films and lots of different styles of music, from all decades. Some of the music in this film are from legends of music like Burt Bacharach, The Bee Gees, Frank Sinatra, etc. I don't think some people appreciate this music or the style of film. It has to be understood that this isn't a comic book film, it's set in Gotham with some of the characters from Batman, which in a way maybe a mistake because it's drawn the type of people that have given all the bad reviews. If this had been an art house film, I truly believe that it would have got rave reviews. It's a truly amazing film, I sat glued and didn't move for the whole 2 hours. It was very interesting and kept me captivated until the end. I suggest that anyone who is going for the Batman, Gotham element, don't bother it's not that type of film. If you enjoy an interesting character driven film with interesting insights into the head of a mentally disturbed individual, then this will really interest you. Also an appreciation of the music it features is helpful but not necessary, if you understand the music is what's in his head as the events unfold, the music parts aren't really happening. Honestly it's a great unappreciated film. That I will be adding to my 4k collection when it's released."
2.0,2 October 2024,"The movie waste of time, The screenplay is boring, The only thing good in this movie is acting of Joaquin and lady gaga, the chemistry between lady gaga and Joaquin was very good, but this movie is musical movie than more than a thriller ,they director is putting so many music in between scenes that was unnecessary , but there is no need of music in that scene , I wish the makers was stopped with 1st part. The ending was horrible, , there is no proper story in the movie , we can't compare the movie with first part, there is nothing but a waste of time , movie below average , avoidable movie ,,"

If not mistaken, the movie contains more than 30 musical rhymes for almost every scene.

It didn't make any sense at all in the first half. We were expecting that the trial must be to build the story for further connecting action scenes. I think I was keeping the dark knight as an expectation and got disappointed so much.

I might sound rude but this was not a crime movie but a pathetic romance gone wrong kind with no story, no context, no action but only music."
5.0,7 October 2024,"This is the saddest & heaviest film I've ever seen in my life. Arthur has wanted nothing different to any other human being, just to be loved & live a dignified life, just basic human needs which he never got. The only thing he got instead is trauma after another from toxic parents, unmet needs, disrespect, bullying, ridicule, abandonment, neglect, violence, and being abused. Still despite all of that, he remained kind and at many instances stood with the vulnerable for what's right & fair. Arthur is an example of a deeply traumatized person like so many in the world, who instead of receiving kindness, compassion and help end up being even more abused, ignored and traumatized. The whole joker persona is a defense mechanism to survive at his weakest and most desperate. Little did he know that this joker fantasy was going to be both his legacy but also downfall. He unintentionally sold other desperate, vulnerable and angry people a fantasy that gave them hope, something to give them power in their helplessness. He was finally ""loved"" for the fantasy, the persona he created to conceal his pain & traumas. Even ""love"" was just a lie; harley didn't see Arthur the human she only wanted to see the fantasy, what she thought was a hero; the Joker. Arthur's alter ego may have granted him temporary relief from his painful reality but ironically it backfired so badly through no other than his ""supporters"" who couldn't stand him bursting his own bubble. It's a sad world and this is why humans are chasing lies, fantasies and power at the cost of compassion, real love and humanity."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I want this Joker 2 to be a joke or a dream and they give us the real one...

Its like april's fool! Where is the story? You ruined an epic concept and a film by a musical. Can't believe this is happening and the director and producer takes such risk and give us somethine boring and not up to the standard. Basically Joker is singing all along with Gaga. And nothing is progressing! Save your money! Don't even dare to watch in cinema... such a waste of 5 years of waiting... I wish they have never came up with this version of story telling after the amazing joker first episode. I hope they come up with the real one after this. Because this must be joke!"
3.0,5 October 2024,"An unfortunate and overdrawn film which would have fared better without the music and with a more interesting story arc, Joker 2 squanders the talent of its leads. It is a disservice to both Phoenix's stellar portrayal of insanity and Gaga's musical talent. It is much too self-serious and heavy-handed, well overshooting its mark. People in the theater were audibly groaning or laughing at the breathy, cringe-worthy, and overlong music intermissions which detract from the impact that a better handling of the movie's themes of duality may have had. Overall, the film wavers between mediocre and downright bad; disappointing may be an appropriate word for it, because the leads could have done wonders with a proper script which better handled its sensitive themes."

1.0,5 October 2024,"I was disappointed with Joker. I felt like I was watching High School Musical at times.

Just when I was getting into the darker, intense mood you'd expect from a movie like Joker, a song would pop up and completely disrupt the tone-it felt unnecessary and out of place. Even Lady Gaga's presence, while hyped, didn't feel crucial to the story. In my opinion, there's a huge difference in quality between the first and second films, with this one lacking the same depth and intensity. The original was gripping and emotionally charged, while this sequel felt like it was trying too hard to entertain. Overall, it missed the mark for me."
9.0,12 October 2024,"Rarely have I seen a film that simultaneously hates itself as well as its audience. Joker 2 (putting aside its pretentious title) is a film that is miles wide and inches deep.

This film is a musical, press statements be damned, it is a musical and there is nothing wrong with that. However, what is wrong is that the film appears to be ashamed of it being a musical and awkwardly tries to hide it from the viewer in advertising until it is forced to show its hand by a mediocre song. It is baffling that one of the biggest pop icons of the last few decades is forced to sing in a painful breathy voice. It is more baffling that the main actor of a musical clearly cannot sing, his great acting put aside.

The film also appears to really hate its predecessor. The joker's character arc from the previous flick is retconned, and the film goes out of its way to slap its message in the viewer's face, subtlety and reflection be thrown aside.

It's 'dark' moments appear to be little more than shock value, and its execution is rushed and seems uninterested and awkwardly give the viewer a moral lecture. If it were not for the good cinematography, acting, and aesthetics, this work would enter the lower 2s.

It manages to tell a lot, but say nothing."

It was actually worse than I had anticipated. I struggle to see what the point of this film is.

I was introduced to Todd Phillips work through his thoroughly entertaining documentary on G. G. Allin ""Hated"". However, I still find it distasteful for him to tip his hat again to one of G. G. Allin's ""friends""- John Wayne Gacy aka Pogo.

Good performances from Phoenix and Gaga. Shame there were no catchy tunes though."

WB Employee: ""Great point! So let's cast a pop star as Harley Quinn, have them do the soundtrack, and drop an album! It's all about the money!""

Rest of WB Employees: ""Hoorayyyyy!""

And no one lived happily ever after...

The end.

I honestly can't understand how the people making these kinds of decisions in Hollywood ever got the job, let alone manage to keep it while continuing to ruin movies for everyone.

I thought Arthur Fleck had descended into madness, but maybe it's me-still holding out hope that this Joker: Folie à Deux is just one big, elaborate hoax.

Wait... this asylum is starting to look awfully familiar."
8.0,9 October 2024,"Although i enjoy musicals, this was not it. Joker isn't the musical kind of movie. The movie itself has drama, good script and actors. But it could've been muchhh better. They waisted the Harley Queen option and the end was so simple. Such a character cannot end like this .... It is a five star review. But I have to say: Phoenix did not disappoint. It's exquisite to watch his performance, gestures, everything. By the other hand, i liked Lady Gaga performance. But somehow I didn't feel the Harley Queen energy. I only saw Lady Gaga acting as a border girl.

My principal thought is... where was the team that did the original one ?"
1.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a visually striking and introspective exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness, blurring the lines between reality and delusion. The cinematography and character development pull the audience into Fleck's chaotic world. Though the musical sequences may divide fans, they reflect Arthur's desire to be an entertainer, adding depth to his spiraling psyche. The film's twist ending, may frustrate some, but it enhances the mystery of the Joker's identity. The appreciation of the film's cinematography, character exploration, and open-ended twist, while acknowledging and understanding some of the frustrations by the fans, still make this a good film to watch. The open-ended conclusion adds to the film's thought-provoking nature, sparking conversations long after it ends."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Up front, I'm not a fan of musicals. The pacing is usually jarring and steals from good dialog between characters (just my take). This was about that. After watching, I got the sense Lady Gaga told the director how it was gonna go. Granted, Phoenix isn't a bad singer but man, I was smacking my head every time they went into another rendition. I suppose it was to sell the fantasy of Joker's mind state but boy, give my man a chance. Phoenix was the star of the show in the original and felt he was mostly muted in this one. The result...see the ratings. Also granted, the score was very good. Just wish they would have stuck more to the dialogue, I'm sure Gaga would have excelled at that. She might have missed her chance."
4.0,5 October 2024,"Let me start by saying that I am huge fan of musicals. Love them. Seen too many to count. Even I found this musical dull and boring. I genuinely found myself groaning every time a song started.

The songs are mostly obscure old Hollywood musical songs and I only even recognized a couple of them, which is only part of the issue with the music. Every time the characters start singing, the story stops dead in its tracks. The songs do nothing to progress the plot like a good musical number should.

It's also a total betrayal of the character of Joker. Not sure what went on behind the scenes, but this is not what you'd want as a follow up to a billion dollar, Oscar winning film. I'd be surprised if this gets many nominations outside of the Razzies. There are moments of brilliance. And then nothing happens with those threads.

Lady Gaga was supposed to be the standout in this movie and I'd argue she still is. She is given very little to do and still does an amazing job. Her singing is as good as you'd expect. I'd love to see the rest of her scenes that have clearly been cut. (I saw the set photos. We're for sure missing several scenes.) It's hard to tell how well everybody else is doing when the story is so weak and the songs aren't there either.

In summary, if you're looking for a courtroom musical drama, go watch Chicago. It's far better and the musical numbers are still amazing to this day."

It is not about ""thinking outside the box"" you can be a half wit & still understanding the meaning / concept, anyone who thinks otherwise should take a hard long look at themselves. Absolutely shocking execution, & feel bad for Joaquin Phoenix & Lady gaga on this poor production film. Whomever gave the go ahead to stage this as a musical should deeply consider their life choices & the future of their career path. I am sure Todd Phillips had a good time writing with another close minded individual.

This is the first review I have done & most likely ever will as I am sure nothing will top how awful this film truly was. Do not waste your time watching it!"
1.0,15 October 2024,"The film is very, very unusual. It's pace can come across as slow sometimes, but I thought that appropriate.

It really tries to see the world through Arthur's delusional eyes.

Joaquin Phoenix is, as in the last film, amazing. An actor who inhabits, in the most physical sense, the characters of Arthur and his demonic alter ego.

Lady Gaga surprised me. I had never considered her as an actor, but her portrayal of a rich and exploitative character was very believable.

I was so pleased that the haunting cello theme persisted in the soundscape of this film, from the previous episode. It really works.

In the end, I felt Arthur really needed protecting from both his inner, and exterior worlds.

But I live in hope that JP will one day play Richard III."
2.0,6 October 2024,"This movie is horrible. When I saw that Stephani Germanotta was in the previews as Harley Quinn, I was shocked. I thought maybe I'll still give this movie a chance. Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. The first Joker movie was amazing. Stephani Germanotta was not a suitable Harley Quinn. There's so many other actresses they could've chosen from. The writing in this movie is bad. Everything about this movie is bad. It's a complete waste of your time and money. People walked out of the movie theater during this movie. It will most likely loose your interest very quickly on. I asked others who also watched it and everyone else seemed very disappointed."
3.0,6 October 2024,"This is the perfect example of why I don't necessarily get excited when I learn that a sequel of a successful first movie is in the works.

I'm baffled by how Todd Phillips though he might have cooked something noteworthy here. Such an uninspired and unsolicited picture.

To be clear, I can have a good time watching musicals. However, I can't recall any memorable musical sequence from this film. While it contains some good old tracks, I feel like the singing performances felt flat and just disrupt the flow of the movie. And I know how good Gaga can be from her role in A Star Is Born. She didn't get to shine.

Joaquin Phoenix is still a master at work but you just can't compare Folie à Deux to its predecessor. The first movie was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. How much better would it have been to experience the same unsettling atmosphere and witness Arthur Fleck's descent into chaos?

I guess that's what many fans were anticipating."
3.0,9 October 2024,"Over indulgence in surreal song and musical sequences, meant that I was eventually dreading it when they started singing. On the plus side, there is a Wes Anderson feel to it. Beautifully shot. The individual performances are excellent. Of course, Joaqin Pheonix is the highlight, but, as said, all the cast pulls their weight. This all said, the film is radically different to the original. The music was used to amplify rather that amuse - which is how it seems. There is significant violence in the film, but not enough basic storytelling action. Two hours of my life lost. A director's cut (maybe by another director) might be worth a look. A shame."

The movie is unfortunately unwatchable. The musical aspect of it was terrible and distracting. The plot was absent, and the movie spent a lot of time wandering aimlessly without story telling. Joaquin was nowhere on the level he was in the first movie. I'm left at the end wondering what the hell the point of the story is.

3.0,3 October 2024,"Well, I've seen my fair share of bad movies, but Joker (2024) takes the cake for the most underwhelming cinematic experience I've had in a long time. This film is a disservice to the iconic character of the Joker and a waste of your time and money.

The storyline, such as it is, is a flimsy excuse for a movie. It's a disjointed mess that jumps from scene to scene without any clear direction or purpose. The plot is so thin that it's practically transparent, and the pacing is sluggish and unengaging. Its unfortunate inclusion of gratuitous gayism in the early stages left me feeling disappointed and disengaged.

What's even more disappointing is the treatment of the Joker character. The iconic villain is reduced to a caricature of himself, stripped of his complexity and depth. The portrayal is shallow and one-dimensional, lacking the nuance and psychological intrigue that has made the Joker such a compelling character in the past.

The only saving grace of this film is the musical score, which is surprisingly well-done (Sarcasm hits everyone). However, it's not enough to salvage the overall experience. The music is completely overshadowed by the lackluster acting, direction, and writing.

I would strongly advise against watching Joker Folie a Deux. It's a waste of your time and money, and it will leave you feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good movie, I recommend checking out something else. There are plenty of better options out there."

Musical wasn't even the reason it was horrible, just no storyline and... ok Musical didn't help. Rated R and there's more songs being sung then murders..

We get the deeper layers and more that it tries to get across, but it never really has an impact on the audience in the way we think it was meant to.

We are also left with many questions, including what was real and what was only in his head.

Joaquin Phoenix did the best joker I have ever seen. I recommend the first movie it's a really perfect depiction of a disturbed psychopath. I feel the director has lost his way in the sequel. Joker 2 is the worst sequel I have ever seen. The director has made it into a musical. Joaquin Phoenix is reduced to a co star in a really poor ripoff of LaLa Land the musical. I drove 30 miles and paid to watch this and was disappointed.

Didn't anyone in the production of this film see the massive disappointment they were about to deliver.

Didn't someone say along the way, we are making it into a musical.

Joker was so good its sequel was expected to match or exceed it.

A message to the director. I'm not going to say your name here.

A Musical ????

You need a career change. Have you thought of being an apprentice school crossing person? You might need an intelligence test, forget it. It might be out of your reach."
1.0,2 October 2024,A great follow up to the first Joker movie! Joaquin is fabulous as always & Gaga is amazing! Her best movie performance til now! She doesn't have the movie time as Joaquin has but it's expected since it's a Joker movie not a Harley one! She should get the recognition that she deserves in the upcoming awards season! Amazing cinematography for once again and the musical sequences are cute. The production design is also a 10. The only negative thing for me is the runtime! Overall a great movie and I can't understand the mixed - negative criticism! Todd took a risk and for me it payed off! You should definitely see this movie!

2.0,6 October 2024,"Poor sequel to a gritty part 1. Pointless breaks into to too many songs, it was just padding and cigarettes to try and distract from a weak and simple plot. Best bit was when the joker actually says stop singing. Real shame as part one was brilliant.

Whilst the singing was annoying, forced, and pointless the music and songs themselves were quite good and quite well executed, not what I expected tbh, it feels like this was just a cash grab.

The scenes were well shot, but nice visuals and forced but we'll performed musical elements do not make up for a poor story and plot.

8.0,11 October 2024,"I made the mistake of going to see this movie without first checking the reviews. I was hoping it would be as good if not better than the first one but, sadly, ended up being bitterly disappointed in this movie.

I watched it in an IMAX cinema and was very surprised to see only around 15 people in the cinema for a 7:30pm viewing. That was not a good sign at all.

I got so bored that I fell asleep 4 or 5 times. I should have left after the first half an hour or so but, unfortunately, kept thinking ""surely this has to get better?"" and remained seated.

It was a huge disappointment after the fantastic first incarnation of this and has engrained in me that I should ALWAYS check the reviews before going to see any movie."
3.0,6 October 2024,"If ever there was a part two that should never have been made it was this movie. The character played by Gaga was so bad that I sat and slept through most of that movie wishing that someone would kill that character. I mean, great voice but did she need to sing in every scene. And did every song have to be a terrible song? And it pains me to say this but that phoenix actor gets so immersed in his roles that I become depressed thinking that this is who he is in real life. He was once a cute kid and now just a medium aged moderately good actor who destroyed his body for the craft. Now - the movie: I was so bored with this film that I slept through some of it. There was no storyline to follow and it never developed that or a character until the credits rolled and then I was just happy it was over. This isn't a review as much as it is a plea to you innocent viewers to not go see that horrible movie. Can I have my money back."

I really liked the film and I think it delivers something more than a superhero film is used to delivering, so I understand those who didn't like it.

It was well worth the experience and it is an excellent film for those looking for a deeper portrait of the Joker's mind and who don't just want something that delivers what is already expected of the character."

Warner Bros. Needs to take a hard look at their creative control over their hit movies, because this sequel is a straight-up embarrassment. It's like they took everything that made the original great and threw it out the window.

I'm genuinely sad to see a beloved character and story fall so far from its former glory. This franchise deserved better, and the fans deserved more. The plot was a mess, the characters were paper-thin, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I'm still wondering how a film with so much potential could go so wrong. I hope the studio takes this as a wake-up call and goes back to the drawing board to figure out what made the original film so great in the first place.

Right now, I'm just left feeling disappointed and frustrated. This sequel was a waste of potential, and it's a reminder that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone rather than trying to revive something that's best left in the past."

I think the real joke of this movie is how little Hollywood thinks of a fan base of celebrities and characters on and off screen.

Sure I like Gaga and Joaquin - why I sat through the whole ordeal. They did the best they could with such a shocker of a story line.

Such a shame to watch such a mockery take place on the big screen in sooo many ways.

The only hope for this movie is anyone who does a sequel to this gets the same actors sing instuctions on assemlbinng IKEA furniture. And it still manages to rate better with fans than this.

Sooo soo dissapointed. Shame on HOLLYWOOD to waste such great talent on such a flop !!!"
9.0,6 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie À Deux"" is an exhausting misstep that betrays the bold spirit of its predecessor. Where the first ""Joker"" was an incisive psychological thriller, this sequel is an overstuffed, self-indulgent mess, trading subtlety for spectacle and losing sight of what made the original so compelling. The film stumbles under the weight of its own pretensions, trying desperately to be provocative but only succeeding in being hollow.

The decision to make this a musical feels more like a gimmick than a thoughtful creative choice. The music sequences are jarring, out of place, and do nothing to further the narrative. Instead of enhancing the emotional landscape, they disrupt it, turning moments of potential tension into unintentionally laughable scenes. It's as if the filmmakers are screaming for attention, hoping to distract the audience from the film's lack of substance with over-the-top set pieces and dizzying visuals.

Joaquin Phoenix, who gave a haunting, layered performance in the original, seems to be on autopilot here. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck feels more like a parody than a continuation of the character's descent into madness. The film's attempts to explore his psyche again are shallow, rehashing the same themes without offering any new insights. The character's arc stagnates, and by the end, we're left wondering if there was any real purpose to his journey this time around.

Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn feels equally misused. Her talent is undeniable, but the script gives her little to work with. Her character comes off as a caricature, lacking the complexity or tragic depth needed to balance Arthur's madness. Instead, the film leans too heavily on their chemistry, hoping it will be enough to carry the story, but it never really gels.

Visually, the film is as chaotic as its narrative. Todd Phillips seems more interested in crafting striking imagery than in telling a coherent story. The cinematography, while impressive in its ambition, often feels like style over substance. The film's color palette and set design, though aesthetically bold, can't hide the emptiness at its core.

In trying to be a provocative commentary on society's ills, ""Folie À Deux"" feels more like a desperate plea for attention, a shallow imitation of the first film's more profound moments. It's a sequel that misunderstands its own success, turning what was once a powerful character study into an incoherent spectacle. Rather than leaving the theater feeling unsettled or reflective, audiences are likely to walk away feeling bewildered and, worst of all, indifferent.

Ultimately, ""Joker: Folie À Deux"" is a muddled and overwrought sequel that squanders the potential of its predecessor. It aims for high art but crashes under the weight of its own ambitions, delivering a film that is neither thought-provoking nor entertaining."

Another major reason why this movie is boring is the lack of compelling characters. Good films typically offer protagonists and antagonists who are layered, flawed, and interesting.

The first minutes I felt okay thinking -I'm sure he is building something up. But 10 Minutes in and I think started to check my watch... Yes Phoenix is a terrific actor (we know that) Lady Gaga can sing (we know that too) the Production is on point (as always) but WHY THE F* DID YOU LEAVE US SITTING THERE IN THE MOVIES WITHOUT ANY STORY!?"
9.0,3 October 2024,"This film serves as a reminder to all of us that Todd Howard was never a good director and Joker was one hundred percent a fluke which came out of him just copying better filmmakers.

This whole movie is a big mess. I can say with confidence the cinematographer was the only person in the whole crew who knew what he was doing and was good at it.

Even for a musical it is in the weaker side of the spectrum. The entire movie feels written around having Lady Gaga sing as much as possible, even in the scenes she's not in.

Phoenix's acting got a downgrade, he feels bored and out of it the entire film, we could argue the character calls for that, but it is, most likely, the actor just not being comfortable playing the Joker anymore (for PC reasons).

There was a single, beautifully acted and profound scene, and it was just a call back to the first movie. The rest of the 2 hour leght it's just singing and really out of place dialogues. Gotham no longer feels like a real place."
1.0,4 October 2024,"True fans of Joker will understand and appreciate this #2 effort from Todd Phillips. It was never about the Joker but about Arthur Flecks' true self. Arthur's confusion is beautifully balanced by Lee's obsession. The musical aspect is mostly a positive except a couple of numbers (namely the wedding and the moonlight rooftop) could be cut making the film 15 minutes shorter and stronger. Both Phoenix and Lady Gaga shine bright, leaving very little room for anyone else, Keener snd Gleeson being the remaining standouts. The ending was beautifully poetic, if tragic. The last few numbers from Gaga and Phoenix are mesmerizing."
2.0,4 October 2024,"Joker was a great movie. A one-off, almost art-house film that really didn't need a sequel. I suppose you can admire director Todd Phillips for trying something different. It's a prison/courtroom drama with a speck of (bad) romance. Oh, and it's a musical too! It's a bold move... But unfortunately, this uninspiring, tedious disaster of a movie just doesn't work.

What's good about it? The performances from the lead and supporting cast are Oscar worthy. Erm, there's also some nice cinematography but that's about it. More scenes with Steve Coogan next time please!

What's wrong with it? Oh man, everything! The first movie was about Arthur Fleck's tragic, tormented and disturbing journey of him becoming the Joker. This sequel has Joaquin Phoenix gone back to being Arthur Fleck, moping around in prison, only fantasising about being in full Joker make-up & suit while performing meaningless songs with his new girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Those of you who were expecting a full-on musical will be disappointed. The songs feel like an afterthought that was shoehorned in at the last minute. Maybe the film-makers realised what an absolute turkey this was going to be and thought 'I know what to do, Lady Gaga can sing! Let's give her some songs and get Joaquin Phoenix to mumble along with her. What a brilliant idea!' How about no! This is a terrible idea and it fails miserably. It only slows the pace of this already unentertaining and depressing movie and makes you worry about what dreadful ideas are possibly on the table for 'The Batman Part II'.

""Let's give the people what they want."" Lady Gaga/Harley Quinn

Well, it ain't this dull, empty and lifeless monstrosity. Can I recommend you watch The Penguin instead?"

3.0,4 October 2024,"Review: Joker: Folie à Deux - A Disappointing Follow-Up

""Joker: Folie à Deux"" feels like a significant letdown compared to its predecessor. The script is shallow, lacking any real tension or suspense that would keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The plot seems disjointed, failing to build up any sense of anticipation or intrigue throughout the film.

One of the most glaring issues is the portrayal of Harley Quinn. The character doesn't stay true to her essence, and there's a noticeable lack of development or depth. Fans of the character will likely be disappointed with the way she's handled, as she feels poorly written and unfaithful to her established identity.

The music choices are another misstep. The songs feel random, out of place, and often disconnected from the narrative. While some films effectively use music to elevate the story, here it feels overdone and excessive, detracting from the flow rather than enhancing it.

Overall, it seems as if the screenwriter opted for a lazy approach, leaving the script underdeveloped and Harley Quinn underwhelming. The result is a film that struggles to find cohesion or deliver a compelling experience, especially for those expecting a rich and engaging follow-up."
2.0,6 October 2024,"It's ok to make it a musical, but it just feels too much and overwelmed for this movie. It just gives completely different emotions amd feelings about the whole character and the first version of the movie. Every important part of the movie is covered with these singings. Too much of the time is wasted on boring plots. And the ending? Completely unreal and a joke. Sorry but it looks like some student has been directing this movie and made it for his project.

It looks really poorly directed and without anything touching the reality and making some sense. It was deserving way better script and sequences."
9.0,8 October 2024,"At first before we go on the cinema there was an intense rumor from other viewers that the movie is more of a musical than an action movie which I personally didn't believe . After ending I was very dissapointed from the lore of the movie because the actors were singing like every 5 minutes. Even the audience after a while when the story was expanding were commenting each other ""now he will sing again"" , and the singing was starting again and again not allwing the lore to expand normally and satisfy the audience . I mean okay , it is mentioned in the genre section that it is a musical too , but the way the movie was shot it was totally non-sense way to direct a JOKER (!!!!) movie . The performs were significantly less than the first movie and they were replaced by singing ! I understand it was lady Gaga on the casting but destroying a totally action movie with jaw-dropping performs and solos of Joaquin Phoenix with duet singing with lady Gaga is more paranoid than the Joker himself ! 4/10 stars because it was Joker ... if it was a random hero movie would be 2/10 ..."
4.0,6 October 2024,"I don't tend to leave written reviews but I've seen and read a lot of the backlash this movie is getting and it's beyond unbelievable, I don't want to focus on the negative so I'll try keep this brief but it appears despite us all knowing this was going to be a musical, most people leaving bad reviews state that they didn't pay for a musical? Well you kinda did cause that's partly what this movie is. Also, for those wanting a Heath Ledger Joker well you've clearly not watched Joker (2019) or bumped your head on the way to the movies and forgot all about it, sure this is a more artistic approach to Joker but I'm all for it!

This movie is a beautiful sequel to Joker (2019) diving deeper into Arthur Fleck and his struggles with his mental health and split personality with the Joker, the music cleverly adds elements of foreshadowing and helps move the narrative forward.

As for Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix, their performances were nothing short of phenomenal! Joaquin as we know has exceptional range and that wasn't to be slept on here as he portrays Arthur and Joker very well, with Gaga adding a softness as Harley Quinn who humanises the Joker and we see another side to him that adds a tone of emotion.

The cinematography again is exceptional but that was never in any doubts!

I truly believe this film is a masterpiece and should not be overlooked by these poor reviews, if you don't want to watch a musical then don't watch this film, if you want a villain in the DC universe then go watch Dark Knight. If however you are a fan of Joker (2019) and want to dive deeper into the tragic story of Arthur Fleck then this is the movie for you!"
4.0,6 October 2024,"Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this terrible bad bad bad movie! If like me you loved the first Joker (I put it in my top 10 movies ever) then do not like me be tempted to see this movie because you think you have to! It is a musical! Yes you heard me right its a musical on the lines of La La land, I can only assume Lady Gaga's singing career has taken a nosedive and she needed to get as many songs as possible in this movie to show everyone she can still sing. And boy was there a lot of songs, why say it when you can sing it. Just like La La land. So if you do not want to spoil the first movie then do not watch this one, I unfortunately cannot erase the memory of this terrible film so will be unable to watch Joker again for a very long time."
4.0,5 October 2024,"..all movie I was: noooo, they singing again, not again!!!!

Without substance, without meaning, without the specific atmosphere of the first movie, an atmosphere that you feel penetrating through all your pores.

If I wanted to watch Law and Order with the Joker, I would have made myself a comic to enjoy on the toilet.

It's not worth paying for a Law and Order musical that doesn't exploit anything from the premise of the first movie, it just gives a scene to Lady ""wanna be an actress"" Gaga.

Bravo for Joaquin Phoenix!

They ruined everything that was good in the first movie. Don't go if you still want to like the first movie!!!"
1.0,6 October 2024,"The biggest mistake was to make a musical movie with a triller movie. The performance was stunning by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. But there nothing to do with the story, you can't make a musical movie with such a story because of lady gaga presence. This was a disaster and disappointing movie. With such buget you can make a better movie. I felt like the movie is made for some of the shot like lady gaga and Joaquin Phoenix smoking into each other and simle of joker. The movie is too bad can't describe with words. But still yhe performance by Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal ,they carried entire movie."
2.0,3 October 2024,
9.0,9 October 2024,"Unfortunately the second movie had nothing to do with the first one which was a real success! The idea to make it musical was definetely wrong (TOO MANY songs!) and the plot felt as if there was not enough creativity to make it go on. Too many songs and lack of real scenario. Also the presence of lady gaga was totally unfitting to the movie. The joker movie shouldn't be presented as a musical/ romance. Additionally it felt as if phoenix wasnt really the protagonist this time but gaga. A lot if hollywood vibe generally which ruined a lot of the concept of the movie.

Really dissapointing in overall!"
1.0,4 October 2024,"1. Music: The most controversial element of this film is undoubtedly its music. While the film is a musical, the songs aren't used as dialogue but to express the characters' inner emotions. Imagine selecting the perfect mood-setting music for an Instagram or Facebook story, hoping that the intended person will see it and understand the deeper meaning. Or perhaps you're feeling deeply melancholic and listen to an old song that brings back memories, unconsciously humming along as tears stream down your face. The songs in this film are almost entirely classic American tunes from the 20th century, making it easy for music lovers to connect the emotions of the songs to the characters' inner turmoil. The score is also exceptional, featuring heavy use of cello and bass to emphasize the film's dark tone. To fully appreciate the film's rhythm and music, it's recommended to listen to the soundtrack album or the previously released single, ""Harlequin.""

2. Script: The plot is relatively simple, focusing on the psychological development of the characters through the love story of Joker and Harley Quinn, and Joker's trial. The most significant plot twist occurs in the final scenes. This ending is sure to be highly controversial but is also incredibly emotionally charged. I cried from the moment the jury reached their verdict until the end of the film. It's important to note that this film should not be connected to Batman or the DC universe. Consider it a standalone film, and any references to DC comics are simply Easter eggs. The romantic progression between Joker and Lee feels rushed and lacks chemistry. After watching the film once, I still have many questions about Lee's inner thoughts.

3. Acting: Joaquin Phoenix delivers another outstanding performance, just as he did in the first film. However, it seems like he gave his all in the first film, so there's not much new ground to cover in this one, aside from his dance routines and singing. Lady Gaga's performance is flawless. Anyone who criticizes her acting in this film has nothing left to say. However, her screen time is relatively short, and there aren't as many intense emotional scenes as in ""A Star Is Born"" or ""House of Gucci."" Additionally, her character's emotional development is somewhat difficult to understand, likely due to the script."
2.0,8 October 2024,"Two of my all time favourite actors, the sequel to a genius film. What could go wrong? Nearly every thing. I was so disappointed. To be fair everyone gave incredible performances, and Gaga makes the petfect Harley Quin, just such a shame it wad in this film. Most people walked out during the film and I can't lie I was tempted to leave myself but I wanted to give it a fair shot. The very last few scenes are the only ones with any action and leaves open for abother movie, just hopefully not another dire muaical. Go back to what it was originally as this movie lost it's way and an all round awful movie."
2.0,4 October 2024,"I have waited for this film for a good while since the last one came out. I was skeptical about it being a musical and although it did add an extra creative touch to the film. However, it did end up becoming the lady gaga show rather than joker 2. Acting was incredible by both main characters and the slowness of the film resembled the unease throughout it all. However, a different story could have been told which would have had a better story line. I would recommend anyone to watch the film but be aware of how long it actually is and the slowness of it all.

Singing and acting was excellent. Actors went to great lengths to engage the audience however, I think this backfired."
2.0,5 October 2024,
1.0,4 October 2024,"I really tried to watch that movie as neutral as possible but I nearly felt as sleep a couple of times. I couldn't follow a ""story"". Waiting for a highlight 120 minutes straight. Used the singing parts as toilet or cigarette break (every 5-10 minutes) Best scene of the movie was when joker himself screemed at gaga to stop singing. Good acting but a horrible and really bad movie at all. Officially one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. That bad that I had to write a feedback. I don't see any other positive aspects beside the names and the picture. Scenes looked like Hollywood, story was more like Temu."
10.0,8 October 2024,"There was some great work done here - Phoenix's acting was amazing as always, and many of the shots were beautifully composed. But Phoenix's joker and the DC universe in general have a large fanbase who, having seen the original, have certain expectations about the film. So making this into a musical was not only disappointing for that fanbase but a real display of creative arrogance from whomever made that decision. People were expecting to see a continuation of the Joker's journey - not a musical portrayal of his death. Movies are a product that people buy - and this one has lost sight of what its customers wanted."

2.0,16 October 2024,"After watching Joker Folie à Deux at an advanced screening, I found it to be a mixed bag. Lady Gaga detracted from the experience whenever she appeared on screen. Some of the movie's creative decisions were underwhelming or disappointing. Joaquin Phoenix's performance was exceptional, but the musical elements brought it down. Gaga's great performance in the A Star is Born remake didn't translate to this film. Despite its flaws, the movie maintains a certain quality. Joker Movie from 2019 still lives on as one my personal favorites. This is a sequel that should have never been but was out of a simple cash grab. I tried so hard to like this movie, but this movie made it so hard. Creative choices didn't mesh well with the tone. If it wanted to be a musical why not lean more into it. To me it's a movie that doesn't seem like it was made for anyone. It's truly sad that Joaquin's great work will be overshadowed by how terribly written this movie was. This is the first time in a very long time I felt like I just wanted it to end. Phillips seems to be out of touch of what an audience would actually want to see. If I were him I would have just left it at the first one which was in many ways a masterpiece."
1.0,6 October 2024,"I think the first Joker movie is one of the best films I have ever seen and I was so excited for the second installment. It was such a letdown! Every time it started to get good, someone would break out of song which I feel like eroded from the grittiness of the material. It made the film and the characters seem silly and lacking substance. I wanted to see more Joker/Arthur and go deeper into who is and could be, not see a musical that took away from the storyline.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the ending. What were they thinking??? There was so was much potential with this character and it was completely wasted.

The only good thing is the acting although I feel it lacks the impact from the first film.

I'm just going to pretend this movie was never made."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Watched a bootleg (7/10 quality), and I'm glad I didn't pay for this. It was a total waste of 2 hours. The movie was pure garbage, and it's baffling how far the director has strayed from the core concept of the Joker. This character, once dark and complex, now feels completely disconnected. The movie tries too hard to blend genres, leaving it feeling like a strange mix of drama and musical, almost like Grease. It misses the mark on what made the Joker iconic. Truly disappointing and not worth the time.

This is NOT what I expected to see. Please DO NOT USE the same director for any subsequent sequels. PLEASE!!!"
9.0,3 October 2024,"This movie does everything the first one does in a much worse and very slow way. Gaga was completely incompetent for this bad written role. Her character had zero depth and the interaction between the protagonists felt forced as if the audience had missed something from the plot.

The musical element was extremely distracting from the main focus of the movie which was supposed to be a psychological thriller. The use of the singing and dancing also felt forced, not done in such a masterful way like the first movie.

The movie was completely unnecessary, crating plots and characters but leaving them all unfinished. It does not emphasise on the key points of the first movie. Seems like they just took the whole cast of the first movie while adding Gaga and waiting for the fans to take the bait, ignoring the weak scenario.

Unfortunately the amazing cinematography is not enough to save a bad written film. The photography direction was top notch and has some Easter eggs for the keen eyed viewers. Apart from that I don't recommend this film if you are a fan of the first one. Personally, I will keep pretending that there is only one joker movie."
3.0,17 October 2024,"Oh, for Fleck's sake... do I really have to spell it out for you?

The simple thesis of this movie is that ""Arthur Fleck is not the guy you want him to be"": he is just a sad case of somewhat justifiable mental illness, and you are fueling his delusion of being Joker. The ""folie à deux"" is between Arthur and YOU.

Just keeping this simple concept in mind will reshape your appreciation of what is, in every way, a very good movie.

Now, should I go deeper into it for those who cannot manage any thought more complex than ""Uh! Crazy guy! Strong guy! Shoot shoot! Heh!"" due to the effect of overexposition to Marvel movies and US politics?

Don't mind me if I do.

The movie openly states:


But, more importantly, it spells ""Fleck is not Joker, not even if he attempts to"".

And, by the way, Lee makes it clear that this is not a sequel to the previous movie, because that was just the cinematic retelling she saw on TV: the real events were (again!) just yet another tragic story of a very mentally distressed loser. Any other Arkham inmate probably has a similar distressing story.

So. If you keep trying to distort this plain reality into your sick power fantasy... you are just as deranged as poor Arthur. Sane people are sorry for you - but you might want to seek therapy."
1.0,8 October 2024,"This movie felt like an empty shell of callbacks to the original, but with none of the heart or depth that made the first film great. They tried to reinvent it as a musical, but unlike the original, the awkward singing only made things worse. The songs felt out of place and did nothing to enhance the story, instead dragging the film down. It was packed with pointless filler scenes that failed to advance the plot or develop the characters. The writing was lazy, relying heavily on clichés and uninspired tropes. The characters were inconsistent, often acting in ways that made no sense just to force the plot forward. Several events were left unexplained, as if added in at the last minute to salvage the messy storyline. The ending was rushed, unsatisfying, and completely disconnected from the rest of the movie. Overall, it felt like a wasted effort that didn't do justice to the original."

1.0,5 October 2024,"I don't think any of us comic book nerds wanted this to be a musical. But we accepted it and said why not? Give it a chance!

It's not the musical that makes it fall flat, it's their performances. Phoenix doesn't do anything different than he did in the first film and GaGa doesn't get used the way she should be.

There is no direction as both characters seamlessly stroll through the film and don't hit any arcs or near misses the entire time. I was trying to stay up as long as I could until I nodded off for 10 minutes.

The first film had me enthralled from the first second. I don't know what he was going for here, but he missed it by a lot."
8.0,2 October 2024,"I have seen a unique characterization of the Joker in the past few years. But this one was a blatant insult to the character of the Joker. Remember the unique performance of the Joker in Batman Behind the Red Mask, and Joker in The Dark Knight. And compare. And it's Harley's character's turn: not long ago, a beginner's script was shown and Harley killed Batman, Harley wore Batman's costume and turned into Batman, now another funny show of this character, of course, this character is not popular. Definitely not, they put it in the story just to attract attention. The story of the movie was worse and baseless than the first part. The same repetitive work of the first film is performed with the addition of dance. Senseless murder. In my opinion, there is no hope for DC anymore."
3.0,6 September 2024,"*Joker: Folie à Deux* is a film that completely took me by surprise, and in the best way possible. Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn is nothing short of spectacular. She brings such an emotional intensity to the role, and her singing throughout the film is just incredible. You can tell she's not just playing the character-she's living it. Every scene she's in, you're drawn to her. And Joaquin Phoenix? Well, we already know he's brilliant, but seeing him sing alongside Gaga adds a new vulnerability to Arthur Fleck that I didn't expect.

Their chemistry is undeniable, and it's especially clear in the musical sequences, which are some of the most powerful moments in the film. It's not your typical musical by any means, but the way the songs are used makes them feel so integral to the story. The combination of their voices and the way they express their characters through the music really hit me.

Todd Phillips' direction is as sharp as ever, and the cinematography is absolutely stunning. It perfectly captures the eerie, chaotic atmosphere of the world these characters inhabit. The film feels like a true continuation of the first *Joker*, but with even more depth and complexity.

Honestly, I believe *Folie à Deux* is destined for the Oscars. Both Gaga and Phoenix deserve serious consideration for their performances, which are some of the best I've seen in a long time. This is not just another comic book movie-it's a bold, ambitious piece of art that pushes the boundaries of what a film in this genre can be.

In short, *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a haunting, unforgettable experience. It's bold, dark, and deeply emotional, and I can't stop thinking about it. Definitely Oscar-worthy in every sense."
1.0,6 October 2024,"I'm so angry and upset with this disappointing movie. I had high expectations and waited a long time for it, but what was that? This is not what I expected at all. It shouldn't have turned out like this. Who came up with the idea to turn this movie into a musical? Why on earth would I want to watch the Joker singing? It makes no sense. Maybe seeing Lady Gaga sing works for some, but why should I have to watch the Joker sing? It's completely unacceptable. Gotham City is supposed to be a psychological thriller-how can you ruin it by making it a musical? It's awful. It's not romantic, and adding a love story to the Joker feels unnecessary. In the end, this is the worst Joker movie ever. It doesn't even really start until an hour and a half in. Before that, it's just scenes without any real substance-no meaningful plot, no action. It feels empty, like there's no story or dialogue. Why should the Joker and Lady Gaga be singing to each other instead of having real conversations? Where are the proper dialogues and acting? It feels like they wasted the first hour and a half. The movie should have started with the Joker breaking out of jail, showing him as the real Joker."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Absolutely crazy. The only quality this movie had for me was a fast forward button on a streaming site. I cannot imagine paying to see this in theatres.

There was no story to pause and see. The musical parts were trash. Why even bother making this? Who was it for? At some point I have to imagine their was someone involved that stopped the production of this movie and manically shouted ""WTF are we even doing?"" as they got dragged off the set.

It's just crazy they can burn that amount of money without some executive stopping the director from robbing the studio. Money laundering can be the only explanation for this trash."
1.0,8 October 2024,"Is it a drama, a super hero / villain film, is it a musical? What it is is long, boring and very predictable. The best things out of this film though is the singing of Lady Gaga and the acting of Joaquin Phoenix . All I can say is, put on a happy face and just grin and bear it lol!

The best part was when the credits ran! And if there was another scene to wait for, I didn't.

And the theater was empty. That should have been my first clue!

I did however, take a quick nap and didn't feel like I missed any meaningful dialogue! It was the same story and not well told.

And there was the cartoon at the beginning!"
1.0,4 October 2024,"Seriously such a disappointment. Not only did the story line Freekin suck but the singing was horrible and stupid. Every time they started singing you could hear the people in the theatre grunting with irritation. How can you go from such a perfect first movie to this? I want to know who's idea it was to make this a musical. Do not go see this. You will wish you hadn't. You'll just want it to end and it won't. When it finally ends you'll exhale with relief. Todd Philips, what a great way to destroy your legacy. You made a cult classic (Joker), but now most will remember you for what a piece of trash sequel you created. It feels like you just gave up in a way and said ""F it"""
8.0,2 October 2024,"I ADORED the first Joker film. It had such rich themes and great powerful and focused storytelling. When a sequel was announced I was terrified. The first movie was a perfectly contained story. Joker Folie a Deux was not. The musical element of the movie really bogged the film down. It is very unfocused and incoherent. Anytime things started to get interesting someone started singing. The songs played didn't really affect the narrative in a compelling way. Ultimately, this movie was made because of how well the first one did.

The movie had great performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga along with great cinematography. But the overall concept and plot felt limiting. They wanted to do something different with a musical but...it didn't work. The characterization of The Joker was abruptly ruined in the 3rd act in my opinion. Whatever development he had in the first movie came crashing down in this one.

Overall Joker Folie a Deux was a huge disappointment waiting to happen. A plot desperately trying to captivate but doesn't stop singing."
4.0,6 October 2024,"The movie is visually stunning, with exceptional cinematography immersing you in its dark and gritty world. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker is nothing short of phenomenal-his raw, intense performance is deeply unsettling, capturing the psychological complexity of the character in a way we've never seen before. Lady Gaga also shines with unexpected brilliance, adding depth to the story.

While many might expect a simple, action-packed comic book film, Joker is far more. It's a psychological study, delving into themes of mental illness, society's treatment of outcasts, and the search for identity. Those who don't appreciate it might miss the layers beneath the surface, but for those willing to explore its emotional struggles and subtle messages, it's a masterpiece.

The film challenges you to think, question, and empathize. It's not an easy watch, but that's what makes it so powerful. It lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. With an open mind, you'll find its brilliance undeniable."
5.0,7 October 2024,"Oh , where do I begin? Apparently, someone thought what the gritty, psychologically intense original *Joker* really needed was to become a *musical*. And not just any musical, but one that hijacks the plot halfway through, leaving you wondering if you walked into the wrong movie. Yes, some of the songs were catchy, but the strong plot from the first half takes a nosedive right when the singing starts. It's like the film loses its way, trading tension and depth for showy dance numbers.

Joaquin Phoenix, bless his soul, gives another outstanding performance as Arthur Fleck, showing consistency with the first film, even as the writing lets him down. But no amount of brooding intensity can save a character from poor writing and an overlong runtime. Lady Gaga? She was good, but with so little screen time, she never quite gets the chance to fully shine. It's like they brought her in, had her belt out a couple of songs, and then decided to sideline her.

And let's talk about pacing. If the first half of the film has you intrigued, the second half might just have you falling asleep. This movie is unnecessarily long, stretching its thin plot to painful lengths. But, hey, at least the cinematography is gorgeous, right? The dark, haunting visuals and metaphors are almost enough to make you forgive the messy story. Almost.

In the end, *Folie à Deux* is a muddled blend of musical missteps and slow pacing. Watch it at home if you must, but don't waste your money on a theater ticket. After sitting through two-plus hours of this, I couldn't help but think, ""At this point, we're the clowns."" But hey, you get what you deserve."

2.0,13 October 2024,"Great films have gone by the wayside as Hollywood has become an empty soul. Gone are rich, engaging characters, well developed storylines that captivate and move you. The first Joker was a masterpiece. This movie is reflective of where the film industry as a whole has ended up - in a shallow pit of disappointment . Maybe the movie was meant to be ironically because the Joker is all of us who spent 2 hours watching it. Congrats to the soundtrack though, it should get a lot of downloads on Spotify.

Why aren't there any good movies anymore? Matt Damon said it perfectly "" These days the film industry seems to be built on unnecessary sequels, remakes, superhero movies, and films that are aimed at the family-friendly market, presumably in an attempt to ensure more money gets taken at the box office""."
1.0,7 October 2024,"Arthur Fleck was a harrowing character study, a one-man show capturing Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker. Its gritty realism and psychological depth were its selling points. Todd Phillips' sequel, however, strayed from this formula, losing the original's essence. Where ""Joker"" was intimate and raw, ""Joker 2"" felt like it was reaching for spectacle, diluting the powerful singular focus of its predecessor. Introduced into this delicate formula was Lady Gaga. While a talented performer, her inclusion altered the dynamics significantly. Instead of blending seamlessly into the dark tapestry of Gotham, her presence felt somewhat disjointed. Her portrayal, possibly a nod to her musical prowess, clashed with the tone set by Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur. This not only distracted from the narrative but also undermined the gritty realism that made the first film so impactful. The seamless storytelling of ""Joker"" was lost in the sequel. Todd Phillips seemed to aim for a broader narrative scope, yet this choice backfired. The tight, introspective focus of Arthur's world expanded, but not in a way that added depth or coherence. Instead, it felt fragmented, as if multiple storylines were vying for attention without a clear sense of direction.

Dilution of Themes: ""Joker"" tackled themes of mental illness and societal neglect with precision. ""Joker 2,"" however, wavered in its thematic focus. The powerful undercurrents of the original were replaced with more convoluted, less impactful messages, diluting the emotional and psychological resonance that had captivated audiences initially.

The tonal consistency of ""Joker"" was one of its strengths. The sequel, however, struggled to maintain this, oscillating between its dark roots and a more theatrical, almost operatic presentation. This shift created a dissonance that was jarring for viewers expecting a continuation of the first film's somber realism. In essence, while attempting to expand the universe of ""Joker,"" Todd Phillips lost sight of the intimate, character-driven narrative that made the first film a success. Lady Gaga's performance, though not without merit, contributed to this departure, further distancing ""Joker 2"" from the original's raw, unfiltered portrayal of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. The result was a film that, despite its ambitions, fell short of the bar set by its predecessor."
10.0,6 October 2024,"Brutally bad, and I mean bad in a way that would make you cut your own hand off in order to flee the theatre. An inexcusable and audacious con job released simply to capitalize on the deserved success of the first film. Shameful money grab, but typical of a corporate culture that treats the customer class as a moronic horde of rubes ostensibly eager to be duped over and over again. I have personally sworn off all future Hollywood releases in lieu of recent torment-fests including the quasi-fantasy, anti-thriller, political-parody CIVIL WAR, which subsequently ruined the reputation of another previously lauded filmmaker in the process.

Truly abysmal."
1.0,9 October 2024,
1.0,4 October 2024,"Genuinely shocked about how awful this movie is. There is good production value, with great cinematography that makes the film pop, especially during some of the musical scenes, and Phoenix, along with Gaga, did good with the poor material that they had.

However, the whole movie is a dull, tedious slog that hates it's own existence that fails in almost every way possible. It fails as a musical, with almost all of the musical numbers feeling dull and lifeless, and barely do anything to move the story forward, having no flow with the rest of the movie. It fails as a courtroom drama, as it fails to provide interesting perspectives on the dilemma the film focuses on, resulting in a shallow court case that's overly drawn.

It fails as a sequel, spending so much of the runtime to tearing down the first movie that it fails to do anything else meaningful and new. And worst of all, it simply fails as a movie by having cynicism towards it's own existence and it's audience, resulting in an overly long whimper of a movie."

I was expecting that the next joker can be like the Batman cartoons with all the bad guys but first the number one Batman enemy ""the joker""!!!! Or the Dark knight with Christian Bale... What a waste of time of movie, why a musical? Is that popular now? No one wants to watch a villian from dc comics in a musical. I don't see Marvel doing a Musical. DC DIrector please keep the DC comics in the path. As a DC and Marvel fan this joker movie is Horrible.....

Next time they should hire Christopher Nolan.

8.0,6 October 2024,"I went into Joker 2024 with high expectations, especially after the success of the 2019 film. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete letdown. The plot felt disjointed and lacked the depth that made the first Joker so impactful. Rather than expanding on Arthur Fleck's psychological journey, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to capitalize on the original's success without adding anything meaningful.

The addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was unnecessary and felt forced. Her character didn't add any value to the story, and her portrayal came across as more of a distraction than an asset. It almost felt like a stunt casting decision rather than a thoughtful addition to the narrative. Instead of delving deeper into the twisted dynamics of Joker's mind, the film shifted its focus to musical numbers and melodrama, which diluted the dark and gritty atmosphere that fans were hoping for.

Visually, the film tried to replicate the aesthetic of its predecessor, but even that fell flat. The cinematography lacked the raw intensity that made the original Joker stand out, and the pacing dragged, making the film feel much longer than it needed to be.

In the end, Joker 2024 feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of exploring new and complex ideas, it rehashes old themes with less impact. It's a pale imitation of the original, and sadly, it just didn't live up to the hype."
1.0,4 October 2024,
3.0,3 October 2024,"A missed opportunity to take your villain to the next level. But what happened? Why pivot to a musical? All Todd Phillips did was perform, failing to truly evolve the character. Even he didn't build the ""folie à deux"" state that the title promises. The carefully crafted Scorsese and Dark Knight references in part one were wasted, abandoned for a questionable new direction. The original film's gritty realism and psychological depth seem at odds with a musical format, risking the loss of what made the first film so compelling. By shifting genres so dramatically, Phillips may alienate the audience who connected with the original's dark character study. The decision raises questions about whether this is a creative choice or just a gimmick to differentiate the sequel."
4.0,2 October 2024,"As someone who appreciated the first Joker film, I found this sequel to be quite underwhelming. While there's nothing inherently wrong with musicals, the musical numbers here felt out of place, disrupting the flow rather than enhancing it.

Moreover, the lack of meaningful character or plot development made the film feel stagnant. The characters themselves appeared overly simplistic, reduced to contrasts with little nuance. The dialogue, while attempting to explore the duality of Arthur Fleck/Joker, ultimately leaned on ideas that felt unoriginal and lacking in depth.

Sequels are notoriously challenging, especially following a strong original, and unfortunately, this film serves as an example of how difficult it can be to recapture that magic."
1.0,5 October 2024,"My honest review:

If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. Rarely have I felt so utterly bored and frustrated while watching a film. The plot, if you can call it that, meanders with no clear direction, making every scene feel like filler. It felt as though the filmmakers had no idea what story they wanted to tell and instead opted for a collection of random, pointless scenes.

In short, this movie was a colossal waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're looking for a way to fall asleep. It's 120+ minutes of your life that you'll never get back. Avoid at all costs!!"
3.0,3 October 2024,"So disappointed. A very poor movie of the Joker 2 Folie de deux They should let Lady Gaga sing and on other movie for Lalaland 2 instep of screwing what they made of the joker's story. She has a beautiful voice but dhe is now an actrees. So much time waiting for this movie and really it sucks. They are not going to build any mountain. What a bad bad bat movie. 👎🏼🤡

The character of the Joker is fine but the movies does not has to much actions and practically nothing happens. Very slow, all is singef and they took a lot of time for making this por quality movie fill of songs and a lack of action."

5.0,3 October 2024,"The expectations were sky high going into the movie theater to watch the sequel and I was in no way disappointed. I see ""Folie a deux"" as a movie trying to explain the design of a monster - Trying to explain why the Joker becomes this super villain of pure evil ... And I think it manages this - In my head the end of this movie calls for yet another chapter where the joker creates his evil universe for Batman to fight. This acting in the movie is sublime and the use of music to describe the shared madness of Harley and Arthur is perfect... The pseudo world they are living in together encompasses the shear madness in their minds - I was really entertained :)"
1.0,19 October 2024,"A Dismal Misfire

""Joker: Folie à Deux"" attempts to build on the immense cultural footprint left by its predecessor, but it ultimately stumbles into a chasm of mediocrity. What should have been a compelling exploration of the Joker's psyche and his chaotic partnership with Harley Quinn becomes an unfocused mess that lacks direction and substance.

From the outset, the film's pacing is a significant issue. Scenes linger far too long, dragging the viewer through tedious dialogue that adds little to character development or plot advancement. The film seems to revel in its own pretentiousness, with long, drawn-out sequences that feel more like self-indulgent art than a coherent narrative. It's as if the filmmakers were so enamored with their own vision that they forgot the basics of storytelling.

The performances, while initially promising, quickly devolve into caricatures rather than complex characters. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker, which won him an Oscar in the first film, feels forced and exaggerated. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn lacks the charisma and depth that made her character compelling in other adaptations, and instead, she seems to be merely echoing the chaos around her without any real agency.

Moreover, the film's attempts at humor fall flat, often resorting to cringe-worthy jokes that come off as desperate rather than clever. It mixes dark comedy with melodrama in such an awkward manner that it leaves the audience confused rather than entertained. The tonal shifts are jarring and leave viewers questioning what the filmmakers were trying to achieve.

Visually, while there are some striking moments, many scenes feel overly stylized to the point of distraction. The cinematography, though occasionally beautiful, often feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy and artsy, overshadowing the emotional weight that the story should carry.

In terms of themes, ""Folie à Deux"" flirts with interesting ideas about insanity, love, and societal rejection, but fails to dive deep into any of them. Instead, it presents a half-baked commentary that feels both derivative and shallow, lacking the incisiveness that could have made it truly thought-provoking.

Overall, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a disappointing sequel that squanders its potential. It tries to capture the magic of its predecessor but ends up being a chaotic, uninspired mess that struggles to find its footing. This film stands as a testament to how even the most iconic characters can falter when not handled with care and creativity. In short, it might just be one of the worst movies ever made."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux strays far from the brilliance of its predecessor. Rather than building on the gritty realism of the first film, it veers into a chaotic mess that feels disjointed. The connection to the original movie is practically nonexistent, leaving fans wondering what happened to the story that captivated them. The inclusion of musical numbers is exhausting and contributes nothing to the main plot. Instead of enhancing the narrative, they distract from it, making the film feel longer and more tedious than it needs to be. The film's tonal shift is jarring, and unlike the first, it lacks any meaningful social message, leaving a hollow experience behind."
1.0,12 October 2024,"Folly 1.

Lack of good sense; foolishness.

""an act of sheer folly"" 2.

A costly ornamental building with no practical purpose, especially a tower or mock-Gothic ruin built in a large garden or park.

Naming films, plays, yourself with something that cannot be pronounced or remembered has to be a terrible marketing idea. Why do this?

I used to love Wakeem Phoenix. He was brilliantly underrated yet understandable in Her. He was convincingly hateable in Gladiator. He could do no wrong up until his Oscars rant about something to do with cows I think?

I did not like Joker as I agree with Variety that it acted like a call to arms for Incels. But he was still amazing. But this time he seems distracted, not really into the role.

It also seems to me that Lady Gaga was caught into a contractual obligation and didn't want to do this film. She has a range and a depth that doesn't come near to being stretched here

The components are excellent but the whole doesn't come together."
1.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips, is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Joker (2019) starring Joaquin Phoenix, but it falls short of the raw intensity and thought-provoking nature of its predecessor. The film was intended to explore the concept of folie à deux-a psychological condition where two individuals share the same delusional belief. However, despite its title, the movie fails to fully engage with this complex psychological theme, leaving the audience with more questions than answers and a sense of missed opportunity.

A Misunderstanding of Folie à Deux In its essence, folie à deux refers to the transmission of delusions from one person to another, often resulting in a shared psychosis. The film hints at this dynamic, particularly in the relationship between Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga), but it never delves deeply enough into the psychological implications of their shared madness. Harley's transformation into the devoted companion of the Joker, often portrayed in comics and films as a descent into madness alongside Arthur, feels incomplete in this movie.

Instead of focusing on how Arthur's twisted worldview infects Harley's psyche, the film opts for multiple musical numbers that distract from the core narrative. These singalongs, while visually interesting, don't add the emotional or psychological depth needed to explore the idea of shared madness. Rather than enhancing the story, these sequences feel like unnecessary distractions, prolonging the runtime and diluting the intensity that made the first Joker film so compelling. In fact, without these musical interludes, the film could have been much tighter, and perhaps, more focused.

The Courtroom Focus and Missed Potential A significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux is spent preparing for courtroom scenes that are meant to build tension around Arthur's fate. Unfortunately, these scenes fall flat, lacking the impact they should have had. The legal drama, which could have provided a powerful setting to explore Joker's manipulation and the spread of his delusions, becomes a drawn-out and somewhat tedious process.

Arthur's trial is supposed to be a climax, a moment where the consequences of his influence on society become apparent, but the execution feels underwhelming. The court scenes miss the chance to create a meaningful confrontation or delve into Arthur's manipulative genius. Instead, they serve as more of a backdrop for the film's plot rather than being a pivotal turning point in the narrative.

By the time Harley Quinn abandons Arthur, it feels like the central relationship has been underdeveloped. Her departure from him because he refuses to fully embrace the Joker persona doesn't carry the emotional weight it should. It leaves the audience questioning what the point of their relationship was in the first place. Their dynamic is a critical part of the Joker's mythology, and in this film, it feels as though the filmmakers only scratched the surface.

A Lack of Direction and Purpose One of the major problems with Joker: Folie à Deux is its lack of a clear, coherent message or purpose. At the end of the film, it's hard to pinpoint exactly what the director was trying to convey. Unlike the first Joker, which offered a raw, gritty look into Arthur Fleck's descent into madness and his transformation into the Joker, this sequel seems to lack that same clarity of vision.

It's true that Arthur, as the Joker, manages to ""transmit"" his delusional beliefs to many of his followers, both outside and inside the courtroom and jail. This mirrors the folie à deux concept on a larger societal scale, as Arthur's twisted perspective seems to resonate with the disenfranchised and downtrodden, sparking a kind of mass hysteria. However, this theme, while present, isn't explored in a way that feels meaningful or new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of what we already saw in the first film, but without the same emotional or intellectual punch.

Additionally, many characters-including the Joker himself-seem disappointed that Arthur doesn't fully commit to being the Joker. This sense of dissatisfaction pervades much of the film, both within the story and for the audience. There's an expectation that Arthur will fully embrace his chaotic, anarchic nature, but that moment never quite comes, leaving viewers with a sense of incompleteness. The Joker's ultimate failure to live up to the expectations placed upon him feels anticlimactic.

An Alternate Universe and Disappointing Ending The film also creates the sense that this Joker exists in an alternate universe separate from the Batman mythology that fans are familiar with. This alternate universe approach is somewhat jarring and further removes the film from any of the Batman movies we've grown to love. The ending especially feels disconnected from any broader narrative, as it offers no real sense of closure or continuity with other DC films. For fans hoping for a deeper connection to the larger Gotham mythos, the film's ending will likely feel frustrating and unsatisfying.

Moreover, the final scenes, where the Joker's influence on his followers becomes apparent, don't provide enough payoff for the buildup. The film could have approached the Joker's rise to power in a more engrossing way, focusing on the psychological intricacies of Arthur's relationships and the societal consequences of his actions. Instead, it leaves the audience questioning what exactly they were meant to take away from the experience.

Final Thoughts Ultimately, Joker: Folie à Deux is a film that had immense potential but failed to live up to it. By focusing too much on style over substance-through the musical numbers and underdeveloped relationships-the movie misses the opportunity to explore its central theme of folie à deux in a meaningful way. The courtroom drama, which should have been a central focus, fizzles out, and the much-anticipated relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn lacks the depth and complexity that their shared madness should have conveyed.

While Joaquin Phoenix's performance remains strong, the film as a whole feels disjointed and unsure of what it wants to say. The idea of Arthur transmitting his delusions to others, while present, isn't fully realized, and the film's ending leaves viewers wondering what the point of it all was. For fans of the first Joker film, Joker: Folie à Deux may feel like a disappointing and unnecessary addition to a story that was already complete."
9.0,4 October 2024,
5.0,4 October 2024,"The movie and the storyline are all good, except for the fact that there were too many scenes of Lady Gaga and her songs.

The director seems to have changed the genre of the movie to musical to add more scenes to Lady Gaga; this is disturbing to me. This movie should have focused more on the Joker and his inner psychological side.

Joaquin Phoenix still did the amazing job as he did in the previous movie. His acting skills are undoubtedly great! The ending is unexpected and left a lot of thoughts for the audience.

Overall, I quite enjoyed the movie. There are many details that need the second watch to understand them thoroughly. I will watch again, and I hope that there will be the third movie."
5.0,2 October 2024,"I loved the first Joker, went to see it twice in the cinema, rated it 9/10, it was an absolute masterpiece.

I saw the imdb rating before watching it and I heard rumors about the movie, so I went in with the expectation that this movie woulld be nothing like the worst, it will be a lot worse, basically I had zero expectation and it still managed to shock me.

This entire sequel could have been a 5 minute extension of the first one (basically the ending joke to be added to the first one) and that would have been infinitely better than this.

This is a meaningless, plotless, garbage, I feel like I have been robbed, couldn't stand up from my seat for minutes because it shocked me that this was it...it was nothing...wasted 2.5hours of my life.

Joaquin played excellent as usual, the guards played well too but that's it."
1.0,3 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux had high expectations following the critically acclaimed original, but unfortunately, this sequel falls short in almost every regard. The film attempts to delve deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, but what was once a nuanced exploration of mental illness now feels more like a disjointed, overindulgent spectacle.

First and foremost, the inclusion of musical numbers-an unexpected choice-ends up feeling jarring and out of place, disrupting the tone established by its predecessor. What worked for other genre-bending films ends up feeling forced here, as the contrast between Fleck's psychological descent and these surreal scenes is more confusing than compelling. Even with the talents of Lady Gaga, her portrayal of Harley Quinn feels underdeveloped, almost like an afterthought in the script, serving more as a caricature than a fully realized character.

The film's pacing is another significant issue. It drags through long, meandering sequences that neither advance the plot nor build tension. While the original Joker was intense and engaging, Folie à Deux struggles to maintain momentum, frequently losing focus with repetitive scenes that try too hard to be provocative without saying anything new.

Lastly, Joaquin Phoenix's performance-while still impressive-seems constrained by a script that doesn't know what to do with him. What should have been a deeper dive into his disturbed worldview instead becomes a rehash of the same ideas, leaving the character feeling stagnant and robbed of the complexity that made him compelling in the first place.

Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is a disappointment. It's a film that tries to blend genres and push boundaries but ends up feeling like a chaotic mishmash that's neither gripping nor thought-provoking. Fans of the original will likely be let down by this sequel that fails to justify its existence."
1.0,9 October 2024,"The original Joker changed my life when I saw it and is still one of my absolute favorite movies today. This sequel added in Lady Gaga and turned it into my favorite style of media, so naturally I couldn't wait, I am disappointed to say it was not worth the 5 year wait. 😬

It starts out messy and just goes completely downhill, the cinematography lowkey carried it. Some interesting plot points and twists were revealed but ultimately the ending just falls flat, Lady Gaga pretty much did nothing besides sing (I mean yeah). But she was basically there as a pawn for Joaquin Phoenix's character, some of the songs and scenes were nice, but ultimately the movie is just a very long mess.

I'm not saying the actors are bad. The actors deserve to be in this sort of movie because they are good actors but the script wears the plot it's all over the place even for it's being the joker it still didn't make sense.

We already had chaotic mastermind in Nolan's Joker and goofy Burton's Joker - both I love. Now we have one (or two) completely different ""Joker(s)"".

There was a good amount of drama and tension in this movie so you never knew when Arthur could have lost it.. lost his mind, lost his head, hurt someone or get hurt. That was very important for me. Drama and tension. The opposite of that was for example Matrix 4 where there were no stakes or tension. Or most of new superhero movies unfortunately - my once favorite movie niche...

5.0,2 October 2024,"This happens when you never embrace the true direction of your film and yet it turns out to be the case. After all the timidity to identify the sequel to the 2019 box office monster a musical, ladies and gentlemen, Joker: Folie à Deux is a musical. But I am not going to clobber, whack, and thump on this film just for its genre because I like a lot of musical films. And I thought those staged sequences we all saw in the trailers should make sense for our two unsound characters. It did not. Even with the undeniable talent of Lady Gaga, whom will bring us to my next point.

I was not stirred by the announcement about the sequel until the addition of Harley Quinn. I love these two characters so much, especially as a duo. All toxicities and abuses aside, Joker and Harley Quinn's power was no joke. Casting Lady Gaga did not turn me off. I know how great she is as an actress and a total performer. The craziness of her artistry should add up. Only to learn her character was a stripped version of the inspiration and more akin to Punchline, Harley's replacement as Joker's henchwoman. Lee was underutilized in Joker: Folie à Deux, a victim of poor, shallow writing of her character, nothing but a bait to comic and Harley fans. Props, however, to her dedication for this character that Gaga even produced a full-length companion album (""The Joker"" currently on repeat). But I'm sorry; her chance to an Oscar nom is now improbable.

Phoenix was just as scary good as his Oscar-winning performance in the first film. Gleeson was also a standout as one of the Arkham guards. Guðnadóttir's score was kind of subdued this time, but just equally haunting as her work five years ago. It's Lawrence Sher's cinematography I enjoyed in this sequel the most.

Joker: Folie à Deux shouldn't have happened. Too much for Todd Phillips' experimentalism and boldness only to under-deliver and land tone-deaf. This is hardly my Jarley. I hope that last scene ultimately draws the curtains on this franchise."
3.0,3 October 2024,"Worst Joker movie ever... I can't imagine what the makers were thinking. If you know your audience you would have never ever directed such a movie. It felt like a ladies night out.

We have been waiting a while to see the follow up on the first movie, which was good. This movie however contradicts its predecessor in every single way. Pretty much nothing happens during the entire movie. Of course it doesn't need to be explosive all the way, but should at least get the adrenaline pumping... well, it doesn't. In any single way.

I do appreciate if you try compose a movie from another angle. Trying to be iconic. This is the wrong angle and will be Iconic in the worst sense."
1.0,5 October 2024,"Went to see this movie with high hopes that it was going to be good. Knowing there was going to be some musical parts/a musical i went in with an open mind. Well, i should have left my mind at the front door or at least blown it away with some old fashion Escobar stuff before i went inside the cinema, because this was bad. Ooooh so bad. I have no idea what they were thinking making this movie. Lady gaga has NO place playing a half lead roles like this and her being in this movie made it suck even more. If it had not been made a ""musical"" and rather given us a more inside depth of the joker all would have been good. Don't waste your time on this!!!"
1.0,4 October 2024,
8.0,4 October 2024,"Seriously? A musical? I've read the good reviews on IMDB and tried to look at this objectively but I honestly think this long awaited sequel sucked more than Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Pt 1.

Feels like they made a movie around Lady Gaga and forgot about what made the first movie so good. Reality.

The cinematography was amazing like the first movie but why they decided to centre the movie around singing and dancing does not make sense.

It seems like every time the camera goes near Lady Gaga she has to be singing. Why?? Just because she can sing? How about acting? It makes more sense for her to be acting rather than singing - because it's a movie - not a stage performance.

Guys, you've lost me on this one..."
3.0,2 October 2024,"Well, the sequel managed very well, almost reaching the same level as the first one. Joaquin Phoenix shows us again his great potential as Arthur Fleck / Joker, one of his greatest roles. Lady Gaga is great as Harvey Quinn, but sadly, she cannot make her character alive as Margot Robbie did. Still, it's a solid performance. Phoenix is still the main reason I went to see this one. Musical? Well, partly.

The whole plot works well, and overall, some like it, and some do not. I mostly got what I expected and was happy. The same director, Todd Phillips, did a great job. Even though the movie isn't as good as the first, it is still one of the most awaited movies of 2024.

Still, I can tell that this is not an action movie. Drama is the more correct term. Plus, some musical scenes are included. Well, I am very short with this review, but I don't want to make spoilers. If you liked the first one, do not skip this. If you don't like dramas or musicals and like a lot of action, then it might not be for you. The first part needs to be seen before this one to get all out of it."
2.0,9 October 2024,"Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, the movie centers around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed comedian who is now incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital and waiting for a trial after committing a murder. There, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), and they develop their relationship as the Joker and Harley Quinn.

Warner Bros. Probably thought they were cooking something when they greenlit a sequel for 2019's Joker, but instead, they give us more examples of why not every movie deserves a sequel, especially when the first one is obviously enough. I still remember at the time of its release, the ending had already sparked a conversation and many theories among the audience, and that's it, there was no need to go much further than that.

Well, the joke's on me for being pumped about this unnecessary follow-up. It's evident that Phillips wasn't planning to make a second movie in the first place because Folie à Deux contradicts everything that happened in the previous one, the idea for a sequel is probably born out of demand from the studio, nothing else. That's why whatever the message they are trying to say isn't working, it made Arthur (Joker) like a completely two different person in this one. Arthur had so many things against him to fully embrace the Joker persona at the end, and the build-up to that moment is perfect, but here, he suddenly forgetting about things that ""made"" him before and, in the end, says he isn't what people are saying because of uhh, moral conflict? (i don't know, lmao).

Lady Gaga did best with what was given to her even though all of her excellent performances were in the musical segments because she was doing what she's good at....singing. The same goes for Phoenix; he isn't as impressive as he was before. Their relationship is a real letdown with almost no development, they are only having fun when they're signing. Some of the musical bits are good I even enjoyed it but the transition of the scene always throws me off and they're making intense moments into nothing."

This was best summed up with the final scene and its musical number that elicited a loud F$&k Noooo from my friend Garry.

I was left trying to process what we watched, the cinema was as cold as the dead script that made it to production.

Seriously this completely ruined what the Joker started.

Like Joaquin trying to warm up his Joker 1 laugh this did not get off the ground.

It was pure wank that deserves all the negative reviews.

Rarely do I feel I've wasted time, I would rather lick my way to the Centre of the earth than waste time on a film this bad."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Joker 2: A Tedious Misfire That Misses the Mark

When the first *Joker* movie was released in 2019, it arrived like a punch to the gut-a bold, daring take on the iconic villain that managed to be both thought-provoking and entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix's performance captured the essence of a man spiraling into madness, set against a backdrop of societal decay, making it a cinematic masterpiece. However, any goodwill that was earned by the first film has been obliterated by *Joker 2*, a tedious, pretentious sequel that is a pale shadow of its predecessor.

Let's not mince words here: *Joker 2* is a complete disaster. The movie is a plodding, slow-burn slog through two hours of absolutely nothing of value. It lacks not only the excitement and intensity that defined the first film, but also any sense of direction or purpose. Instead of offering a deep dive into the psyche of its disturbed protagonist, the film meanders aimlessly, giving audiences little more than a meandering mess of disjointed scenes and underwhelming performances.

To call this movie boring would be an understatement. The pacing is so glacial it makes watching paint dry feel like a thrill ride. The tension that was so palpable in the first *Joker* is nowhere to be found. Instead, we are left with long, drawn-out scenes that serve no purpose other than to test the viewer's patience. Each moment feels like it was stretched out to fill time, with no regard for whether it actually contributes to the narrative or character development. The ""slow-burn"" approach might work if there was some payoff or if the scenes built towards something profound. But in *Joker 2*, there is no payoff. No crescendo. No catharsis. Just an interminable, soul-crushing march toward nothingness.

And then there's Lady Gaga, whose inclusion in this movie is one of its biggest missteps. The idea of casting her might have sounded good on paper, but in practice, it's a monumental failure. Her portrayal is laughably bad, a grating and uninspired performance that is more annoying than anything else. To say she can't sing would be too kind. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to shove her into this film in an effort to make it more ""artsy"" or ""avant-garde,"" but instead, it backfires spectacularly. Every time she's on screen, it feels like a bad karaoke night that refuses to end.

Speaking of which, why was there so much emphasis on musical elements in this movie? Did we sign up for a crime drama or an amateur cabaret? If I wanted to sit through a painfully awkward musical performance, I'd watch an off-Broadway show in a basement theater. But this is supposed to be *Joker 2*-a follow-up to one of the most intense, psychological films of the past decade-and what we get instead is a painfully cringeworthy attempt at blending musical and crime drama elements that feel as mismatched as oil and water.

The film, at times, resembles a bad episode of *Law and Order*-not in its best seasons, mind you, but in those filler episodes they cranked out to pad a season. The crime and tension that were integral to the first *Joker* film are now replaced by dull, predictable scenes that wouldn't be out of place in a third-rate procedural. If you've seen one crime scene in this movie, you've seen them all. The drama, the stakes, the intrigue-everything that should define a great crime movie-are completely absent here.

The writing is perhaps the worst offender. It's as if the screenwriters forgot what made the first film work. The gritty realism, the visceral sense of tension, the tragic spiral of a man lost in his own mental instability-it's all gone. Instead, we get what amounts to a second-rate art-house film trying to pass off pretension as depth. It feels like the writers believed that by slowing everything down, by dragging every scene past its breaking point, they were creating something profound. In reality, they just produced something unbearable.

Even Phoenix, as talented as he is, can't save this train wreck. It's hard to blame him, though-what can an actor do when the script gives him so little to work with? His character feels flat, drained of the energy and complexity that made him so compelling in the first film. Gone is the tormented, unpredictable force of nature. In his place is a character so stripped of nuance that even Phoenix seems to be sleepwalking through his scenes.

If you were expecting an exhilarating, thought-provoking follow-up to the first *Joker*, you will be sorely disappointed. What we have here is a vapid, tiresome exercise in patience, a film so devoid of excitement or substance that it feels like an insult to anyone who admired the original. *Joker 2* is not just bad-it's offensively bad, a movie so misguided and poorly executed that it feels like a slap in the face to anyone who enjoyed the first film."
10.0,5 October 2024,
3.0,7 October 2024,"When I go to the movies, I want to be entertained, and this was nothing if not a bunch of entertaining moments.

The first story was about a guy gone delusional with depression, and it wouldn't have worked to use that same delusion device a second time. Instead we get a completely different concept for a film. Madness set to music.

It's maybe that completely different concept that threw some people. I grew up with a fair amount of musicals in my life, tedious as some of them could be. This film managed to evoke some of the best parts of a musical while still working as a follow up to the story of Arthur from the first film.

If you didn't expect to see Lada Gaga in a musical where she screws an unwashed Joaquin Phoenix then maybe you didn't want to see this one. Vaudeville mixed with the ugliest side of humanity isn't for everyone, I guess.

It made me smile. The end was apt. The musical performances were adorable. I don't see what's not to love."

1.0,11 October 2024,"*Joker: Folie à Deux* presents a unique direction with impressive lighting that vividly showcases the characters' emotional depth. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a gripping performance as Arthur Fleck, again capturing the character's psychological unraveling. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harleen Quinzel introduces a new dynamic to the story. However, her character felt more like an actor playing a role than an authentic extension of the Joker's world.

The film takes bold risks by embracing elaborate musical numbers, a departure from the original's gritty realism. While visually striking, these sequences may feel jarring and unnecessary to some viewers. The sequel focuses on the twisted love story and psychological themes rather than continuing the grounded, societal critique that made the first *Joker* so impactful. In my view, these creative deviations, though daring, failed to add significant value to the franchise. The film feels like an unnecessary extension that strays too far from what made the original such a powerful standalone piece."

1.0,15 October 2024,"And that's why those lazy writers (especially that Terrible Todd Philips and his God-Awful a-bit-too-much nudity for the Hangover films) should have left the first Joker 🃏 film alone, because they did Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) too dirty in this God-Awful sequel. I don't hate it because it's a musical. I understand why it's a musical, because Arthur and Lee Quintel were singing and dancing in their heads. Joaquin has an amazing singing voice. The voice time I heard him sing was when he played the legendary country singer Johnny Cash (Walk The Line). But still it's NOT why I hate it.

These are the reason why I hate that film so much:

1.) It's because of the scripts and story 2.) The writers did Arthur Fleck dirty by letting him get hurt and raped by the security guards 3.) Make Lee Quintel (Lady Gaga) broke up with Arthur just because he said ""There was NO Joker"", and that he was a lonely man who wanted to be nice & kind to others 4.) Make Arthur regret being the Joker 5.) Let an unnamed prisoner who was secretly watching Arthur and then psychopathally kill Arthur by stabbing him a million times through the stomach and let him bleed to death while carving his own smile in the background before Arthur was going to meet a visitor that we never saw who it was. It could've been either Lee Quintel

They definitely should have leave the first film alone. I prefer the first film way better than that God-Awful & Disturbed sequel. Hope it doesn't get nominated at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, Critics Choice Awards nor Oscars (even though Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix Bob did a fantastic job. It wasn't even their fault.)

Joker (2019) Joaquin Phoenix will always be the best Joker film of all times, after Jared Leto and the late Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight)

I'd rather cast Joaquin and Gaga as different verison of Joker and Harley Quinn in Matt Reeves' Batman with Robert Pattison's Batman, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman, Paul Dano's The Ridder, Andy Serkis's Alfred Pennyworth, and Colin Ferrell's Penguin.

I really hope that this Godforsaken sequel has an assload of dislikes 👎🏽 because that ending was God-Awful.

I remember watching this with my co-worker thinking that it might be a good film, but Lord, was I wrong. I'm kind of glad those people behind us ruined the movie for me by leaving the lights for about 3 mins and talking on a phone silence for a minute, because I lost interested watching that God-Awful & disturbing sequel again. They shouldn't have made it in the first. There, I admit it. Should've leave the first film alone. The first film had a perfect ending, and they just had to do a sequel of it.

I'd rather cast Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as different versions of Joker and Harley Quinn in Matt Reeves' Batman with Robert Pattinson's Batman, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman, Paul Dano's The Ridder, Andy Serkis's Alfred Pennyworth, and Colin Ferrell's Penguin.

I also really hope Margot Robbie comes back as Harley Quinn in the James Gunn's DCU in the future soon, and at least let Jared Leto play a different version of Joker 🃏 too. That's what I'd rather watch!

Also, I'm really glad that Bradley Cooper didn't come back to produce the God-Awful & disturbed 😳 sequel, because that s**t was awful, sad, depressed, nasty, and disturbed like the ending. The first one was wild enough."
8.0,20 October 2024,"What was once a complex character study of Arthur Fleck has devolved into an over-the-top, incoherent spectacle that doesn't seem to understand what made the original Joker so gripping. If you were hoping for a deeper exploration of the character's descent into madness, you'll be sorely disappointed. Instead, you're treated to awkward, misplaced musical sequences that clash with the darker tones of the story. The plot is disjointed, confusing, and lacks any real direction. It feels like the filmmakers were so focused on trying to make a statement that they forgot to actually craft a compelling narrative. The pacing is a mess, and key moments that should have emotional weight fall flat due to poor writing and the absurd decision to have characters break into song... It's very sad that they made this movie at all."
1.0,12 October 2024,"Joker 2: Folie a Deux wasn't trying to be another comfort food maniacal por, rayal of the Joker as we've seen so many times before but a thoughtful exploration into the roots of madness; does the victim really want to be that way, or just putting on a temporary guise and seeking the love of a willing partner and muse and normal life. The musical numbers are reminiscent of those in All That Jazz, with Fleck's interior world as he undergoes his trial being communicated similar to Bob Fosse is n ATJ as he faced mortality with his heart attack. Lady Gaga does an outstanding job with her portrayal and the music, as does Phoenix. Given a chance, a bold departure from the normal comic flick and worth seeing."
1.0,20 October 2024,
5.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux delivers some truly great performances, particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. Phoenix once again proves his depth as an actor, embodying the chaotic, tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck with precision. Lady Gaga brings intensity to her role, and their chemistry is palpable. However, despite the strong acting, the film falters significantly in other areas.

The story lacks coherence and feels disconnected from the foundation built in the first Joker film. The narrative seems to meander without clear direction, relying too much on spectacle and musical numbers rather than meaningful plot development. What could have been a deep dive into shared psychosis or a compelling exploration of two fractured minds instead becomes muddled and overly abstract.

Additionally, the movie drags on far too long, with many scenes feeling stretched beyond necessity. This pacing issue, combined with a disjointed story, makes it a slog to get through. While the performances keep it from being a total failure, Joker: Folie à Deux ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, weighed down by its own ambition."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Since it was said that the movie would be a musical, it was questioned how logical this decision would be. Also, it didn't make sense to make a sequel to the ""Joker"" movie. The movie was bad. It was bad as a musical and bad as a movie too. The decisions made in the finale were also bad. The atmosphere and cinematography of the movie were good. Also, Joaquin Phoenix did a very successful acting performance. Brendan Gleeson was also good. I wouldn't say I liked Lady Gaga's performance. The script and this character were wrong and bad. Harley Quinn shouldn't have been this bad. We have never seen madness...Also, the Harvey Dent character was miswritten, and Harry Lawtey didn't suit the role at all. The ending and the twist of the movie were not a good idea at all. Anyway, at the end of the day, it was a very boring movie with average music. It was one of the disappointing movies of the year."
1.0,11 October 2024,"There was no payoff nor any sense of direction nor interest in any of the characters. The atmosphere and dark world building was the only thing that held up. There was one explosion in the entire movie and I was really hoping for more. That the movie would go in that direction, bridging the movie to the original story. But no, the very opposite happened. I had absolutely no expectations for this movie yet it somehow lowered the bar anyways. I was told about the musical numbers, so I was prepared for that. It felt like they exchanged the story for pointless singing. Maybe I need to rewatch it to understand, but I don't think I want to see it again."
8.0,8 October 2024,First I think phoenix is a good actor. I liked him in several movie roles but the script and story line really hurts his career I really dislike when they make sequels thinking they can piggyback on the last movie. People are just not that gullible. Lady Gaga was horrible. What the hell is she doing acting anyway ?! Singing? Promoting herself ? She's supposed to be acting. Creating a character we believe. It was just foolishness that I honestly nearly walked out Which would have been the first time I did that I use to go to the movies 4+ times a month sometimes seeing 2 in the same night but now it's once a year The industry killed itself.

I love action movies and I love deeper movies too. I love the superhero movies but I love the dramas, the mysteries, the good musicals and pretty much anything that's not basically lame. This one? Not too sure where it falls but it brings pretty much nothing. No new story, no quality music or songs (as far as interpretation is concerned), no impressive photography... maybe the only thing of interest is the ending... but you may as well look for spoilers and save money."
4.0,7 October 2024,"My expectation: this should be the best movie in 2024, even better than Dune 2 possibly.

Reality: Me audience turn into a real joker.

As a huge fan of the first ""Joker,"" my anticipation for ""Joker 2"" was through the roof. The original film delivered a powerful blend of character study and social commentary, leaving audiences captivated by Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. I expected the sequel to elevate this experience, possibly even surpassing other cinematic giants of 2024, like ""Dune: Part Two."" However, the reality of ""Joker 2"" transformed my excitement into a disheartening experience, leaving me feeling more like a ""real joker"" than an entertained moviegoer.

From the moment the film began, it was clear that the tone was markedly different. The striking visuals and haunting score that characterized the first film felt absent, replaced by a muddled narrative that struggled to find its footing. While I had hoped for a deep exploration of Arthur's psyche and the societal factors that shaped him, the sequel instead meandered through disjointed storylines and underdeveloped characters. It felt as though the filmmakers were attempting to replicate the success of the first film without fully understanding what made it resonate with audiences.

One of my main disappointments was the handling of supporting characters. The original ""Joker"" featured a memorable cast that complemented Arthur's journey, but ""Joker 2"" felt like a missed opportunity. Instead of providing depth and context, many characters were mere shadows of their potential, leaving me yearning for more substance. It was frustrating to watch as the film juggled various subplots, none of which managed to coalesce into a coherent narrative.

Furthermore, the pacing of ""Joker 2"" left much to be desired. Moments that could have been powerful and impactful were often rushed, while less significant scenes dragged on. This uneven pacing contributed to a sense of disconnection from the characters, making it difficult for me to engage with their struggles. By the time the film reached its climax, I found myself emotionally detached, unable to invest in the outcome of Arthur's journey.

Visually, I had expected the same level of artistry that marked the first film. Instead, ""Joker 2"" seemed to rely on gimmicks rather than innovation. The cinematography lacked the striking imagery that made the original so iconic, and the score, once a haunting presence, felt generic and uninspired. The film failed to create the atmospheric tension that had drawn me into Arthur's world in the first place.

In conclusion, while my expectations for ""Joker 2"" were sky-high, the reality was a disheartening experience that left me feeling like a true joker. The film's failure to deliver a compelling narrative, coupled with its underdeveloped characters and lackluster visuals, made for a disappointing viewing experience. As I reflect on my journey through this sequel, I can't help but wish it had embraced the depth and artistry that made the original so unforgettable. For those seeking a continuation of Arthur Fleck's story, be prepared for a ride that may leave you feeling more bewildered than entertained."

Can someone explain why they were singing even during normal dialogues?

This movie was nothing but a recap of 1st. Did the understand why there was court case for half of thr movie. What they went to achieve ?

Director could have easily done soo much better. Don't what the people were thinking.

Fans for this movie would like to see violence and Joker getting deadlier not a singing competition.

They also killed the Joker in the end. Again why?

9.0,3 October 2024,"Not what I expected after watching the first one, too musical, no actual story, made up events with no real connection, very messed up ending that doesn't even relate to Joker original character.

Booked the tickets over a month ago, wanted to leave after 20 minutes but waited till the end as I expected a twist. Yet it never happened.

It was just a story telling in the court room about whatever happened in part one, love story that came out of blue, very basic scenario and dialogues that don't make any sense, too much unnecessary songs I really don't know why Joaquin Phoenix accepted such script / scenario. Very disappointing."

4.0,7 October 2024,"This is not an anti-hero movie. Its about Arthur's struggle with mental illness and fantasy. His meeting with Harley Quinn is the tipping point for his slide into insanity. Harley Quinn having a less grasp of reality than Arthur. The musical component of the movie is both their minds fracturing in and out. The most disturbing part of the move is realising Todd Philips ability to see into this kind of mind. Probably the most expensive mockumentary ever made.

Again like the first movie, this will probably be shown in University Phycology courses.

This move may not do well in the box office, as I think it has been wrongly marketed. But certainly result in some Oscars."
1.0,10 October 2024,"First up - it is a musical. And that was fine. Gaga can obviously sing and Phoenix too. But this is a story about the Joker. After the first movie that was really very well done - they just trashed it am by backtracking on everything that made the first one good.

I honestly don't know why they would trash the Joker character so badly unless it was intentional. Bizarre movie that i wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a fan of Batman or Joker characters , or the first movie.

I know i am not the first person to say this but i did have high hopes for this based on the quality of the first one. I went opening night very excited to see the further development of the Joker character. Instead we get a weepy, weak, boring and broken wimp of a guy who not no resemblance to either the character we saw at the end of the first movie or the character from there comics/films."

5.0,6 October 2024,"Regardless of your thoughts on Joker (2019), one thing that can be agreed on is that it did not need a sequel. But, unfortunately for everyone, money talks and its clear WB wanted a sequel. And so here we are, with an unnecessary sequel to a decent first movie which ended fairly well. What we have now is a film desperate to right the perceived wrongs of the first, a bloated, meandering sequel that ultimately has nothing to say.

To start with the positives, and there are a few, the acting in this film is great. I was surprised that Joaquin Phoenix still gave it his all, when he could have easily phoned it in. Lady Gaga was also excellent as Lee Quinn (that's her name) and the pair have solid chemistry on-screen. The film is also well-shot, maintaining the aesthetic of the original film and the score is pretty solid, although it reuses a lot of the first film's score. An aspect that I wasn't expecting to like was in fact the musical numbers. Some are actually quite solid and I can see the potential in making this a musical. It does play well into the Joker's psyche. It is then a real shame that the execution is all over the place with very few of the numbers truly contributing to the overall film and most are clearly there to distract from the pacing, plot and writing.

This film is pretty slow, and not a lot happens. At times it feels incredibly repetitive, with a lot of scenes feeling redundant and so often a musical number is sprinkled into a conversation just to make it appear interesting. The film lacks a strong POV, constantly switching between Arthur and Lee, when I personally think having Lee be the POV would have made the film stronger. The character work is also questionable, especially when it comes to Arthur. It seems Todd Phillips disliked how many people enjoyed Arthur's descent into madness and thus decided to regress him back, presenting The Joker as merely a persona, even though the first film ends with him fully giving in. By the end, I am not even sure what the point is anymore. I can see the idea, but it is poorly executed with little attention given to it. What frustrates me most is that this film is ripe with potential, but it squanders nearly all of it which leaves this film feeling half assed and empty in the writing department.

Overall, this film just doesn't need to exist. It reduces any significance the first one had, whilst adding nothing new itself. It is constantly on the cusp of something potentially great, but it never commits. It is a shame, because there is great potential here, and everyone (barring the writers) seem to be giving it their all. A film that will leave you with a blank expression once its all said and done."
9.0,6 October 2024,"My review of Joker is that it felt a bit short and didn't cover an extensive range of material. The pacing was slow, and the film was mostly confined to just two main settings: the prison and the courtroom. However, what I appreciated about the movie was the insight it gave into the Joker's mind. It was fascinating to see how his past experiences shaped him into the person he became.

While Joker felt limited in scope with its slow pace and confined settings, it excelled in exploring the psychology of the character. The deep dive into the Joker's troubled mind and the events that shaped him was captivating. We got a glimpse of his transformation, from his traumatic past to the circumstances that led to his current state. The movie didn't rely on action or numerous locations to make its impact; instead, it focused on the psychological unraveling of the Joker, which made for a thought-provoking experience. The minimalistic approach in storytelling allowed the audience to fully absorb the complexity of his character."

Just with the dynamic of Arthur being cheered for being Joker in the first movie and when not being Joker, he is seen a waste; is self explaining of the reception this movie is getting.

Arthur is a waste. You don't care any at all about him. You never cared. Its was fun and satisfying when he was causing acts of mad violence that satisfies the destructive urges that are in people, public, masses (however we can call it). It's safer to satisfy that urge on other people who went that far, as in Joker, is my safer because you don't have to face consequences for your destructive behaviour. Cheer them went they satisfy and boo them when they not.

The movie is directly exploring the ""Joker phenomenon"" and forces audience to self reflect, which is something obviously most people failed at.

The movie makes us experience Arthur's asylum days.

Reality and fantasy cuts deep both ways, Lee being a pivot point and catalyst for Arthur. There are variant factors and moments that pushes Arthur back and forth around his sanity.

I don't find musical pieces over done or unnecessary, since for Arthur while growing up old school entertainment programs on TV while he was growing up was his escape in that abusive household, and his mother pushed him more into delusional behaviours since his childhood, even to his adult life.

The movie has an emotional flow that is led by key moments and requires attentive watching.

I understand the disappointment people had with not seeing spectacle of ""The Joker"". After all this is an adaptation. The original source material is out there in the comic format, for for those who wants to enjoy the Joker character for whatever reasons.

Insisting on not understanding this and the first movie was trying and pushing it into an expectation of spectacle is unfair and blindly done.

The hate this movie received just draws paralel to Arthur's experience. You just don't care about him, you cared about seeing The Joker and when it wasnt given in the way you wanted, Arthur was a waste. Now it's popular to bash him and this movie.

I appreciate the honesty of this movie for these reasons and from production to actors and direction, it is a well made movie."

But he's made me a pretty disappointed.

This 4 ratings for pheonix only. Because he's done his part as good as he is... Better keep this joker part to the next DC movies.

9.0,7 October 2024,"The first movie was an absolute masterpiece. Building up a great personage, emotion, you really start feeling for Joker. And trust me, this was proof that Joaquin Phoenix was an absolute 100% match for this role. You would expect that the producers saw how absolutely fabulous the movie was, how well it was received by viewers and the amount of hype people had.

Then they decided to do this. A musical movie which has no emotion, nothing grabbing the viewers, no action, nothing of the sort which belongs in Gotham. Lady Gaga besides Joaquin Phoenix is a joke. I just can't believe what they did here. 80% of the movie feels like singing and music, but it doesn't strike any interest in me. During the movie, 20% left before the break. Another 15-20 people left after the break, before the ending of the movie. There I was, expecting things to turn around and become better, but nope. Sadly that wasn't the case. I am not giving this a 1 star rating as I love Joaquin Phoenix, but 2 stars because something like this should never, ever, repeat itself."
1.0,12 October 2024,"This was a unique look at the makeup of Joker or Arthur Fleck. The decision to not give the audience the expected same old generic storyline of Joker becoming a pure villain, was what made this movie a truly original storyline. It follows in the same fashion as the first movie showing Arthur as an individual effected by life's circumstances and the struggles of a mental illness in a society that wants to ignore it or impose their own expectations. Wasted on people wanting to see just another violent Joker or comic book villian. Acting was once again amazing with the portrayal of Arthur and the subtleties of his battle with sanity etched in every scene, outstanding! The score does not reflect the movie but the small minded expectations of people watching it. If you are open to something different I could not recommend this enough."

I watched it on opening weekend, and there were only 10 people in the theater; half of them walked out before it even ended. I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did. Such a frustratingly wasted opportunity.

I made an account just to post this review. Save your time and skip this one."
2.0,2 October 2024,"Five years. That's how long I waited, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Arthur Fleck's dark, twisted journey that shook the world with Joker (2019). The first film was a masterpiece - gritty, raw, unapologetically real. People connected to it on a visceral level. But after seeing Joker: Folie à Deux, my one overwhelming thought was: Why, Todd? Why?

The film had so much potential, but what we got was a chaotic mess, completely out of touch with what *Joker* had originally set up. Let's break it down:

Lackluster Storytelling: Where was the story? There was no cohesion, no forward momentum. The film felt like it was rambling, disconnected. *Joker* 1 had us gripped in Arthur's descent into madness, but here? It felt like they just stitched together random scenes. There were no stakes, no real suspense, no build-up. Instead, we were left wondering what happened to the raw, unfiltered tension from the first film.

The Musical: Completely Off Track: I get it - musicals are a bold move, but this one? It just didn't fit. The entire concept felt like an unnecessary distraction, completely out of sync with the grim world that *Joker* inhabits. Lady Gaga is incredible - no doubt. She was probably the best part of the film, but the musical element didn't mesh with the gritty, psychological intensity that made Joker so captivating in the first place. Instead of adding depth, it came off as pretentious and forced.

Where's the Cinematic Brilliance?: Joker 1 was visually stunning. The cinematography had a purpose - every shot, every angle told a story. *Folie à Deux*? Not so much. The visuals felt bland and uninspired. There was nothing that made me sit up and say, ""Wow, this is a work of art."" It was as if they forgot the very essence of what made Joker so visually engaging.

No Dialogues: Where were the sharp, thought-provoking dialogues that Joker was known for? The first film had lines that stuck with you long after the credits rolled. In Folie à Deux, there wasn't a single line that stood out. The film left no lasting impact in terms of narrative or dialogue. It's like they completely missed the point.

Music That Didn't Hit the Mark: And then there's the music. What happened? The score of Joker 1 was haunting, a perfect reflection of Arthur's psyche. In Folie à Deux, the music didn't add to the atmosphere - it detracted from it. Nothing about the score felt like it belonged in the world of *Joker*. It lacked intensity, lacked emotional resonance, and ultimately left me detached.

A Disappointing Direction: I can't help but feel this film was made simply to cash in on the success of the first one. It felt rushed, like no one really cared about crafting a meaningful story. Todd Phillips delivered a piece of art in *Joker* 1, but here, it feels like he lost his way. Was this film even necessary? Did anyone ask for this? The brilliance of *Joker* didn't need a sequel, especially not one like this."
1.0,9 October 2024,"I've been on a quest for meaning my whole life, and I thought I'd finally find it after watching this movie, but nope, still searching.

The Joker in this sequel feels like a totally different character from the first one. Honestly, he doesn't scare me at all. I mean, come on, the Joker from that deleted scene in Batman was way more intense.

And seriously, why did they turn this into a musical? It's honestly worse than Madame Web and the 2005 Fantastic Four. At least Madame Web had some attractive babes in it.

If I could give this a zero-star rating, I totally would, but I can't. It's just a pointless film made by someone who thinks they know better. I really wish Nolan hadn't left Warner Brothers so soon."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I just watched this movie and it left me enraged! 1 their was BARLEY even a plot the whole plot was SINGING!! I like musicals and all but Lady Gaga literally ONLY sang she barely even spoke any words but still had SOOO MUCH screen time?! I hated ""her version"" of Harley Quinn it was THE most garbage Harley I've ever seen! And to TOP it all off, they also kinda ruined the Joker and Author too, in the movie they made it to were Joker was just crazy and had two personalities LIKE BRUH!! Does DC even read their own comics?! The Joker just didn't seem like the Joker to me, maybe I'm just being critical because the only Joker that I love is the Heath ledger Joker BUT honestly I can't EVEN compare Heath Ledger to this Joker... any way like Geez, this movie was so bad yall DONT even watch it, just don't trust me..."
10.0,2 October 2024,"The best way to describe Joker: Folie à Deux is that it's an uneven road, occasionally lined with cherry blossoms, but ultimately leading to nowhere.

What's frustrating is that everything is there: unparalleled performances, a multidimensional soundscape, state-of-the-art set design, vibrant and well-realised musical numbers, iconic scenes and imagery, a masterclass in cinematography and lighting - But all of it amounts to nothing as the director's ego overpowers the script's ego.

An argument can be made that the film does too much, while another segment of viewers might rightfully claim that the film doesn't do enough to justify its existence.

The makers try to tell a story that simply isn't there. The characters at the start are unchanged by the end (if you can call that an end). There's an illusion of journey when in reality it never began.

Half of this film is a song sequence. Now, I don't mind musicals, and the symbolism of music is well justified within the film. But by the time the 15th song rolls, it feels like the magician has no more tricks up his sleeve. Symbolism comes at the cost of effective storytelling.

With a reported $200 million budget, Joker 2 feels miniscule compared to its predecessor, which outclasses it in nearly every aspect. It has its moments, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. A narrative mess, a cinematic blunder, and a disservice to the character."
1.0,2 October 2024,"The first Joker is one of my favourite films - this movie brilliantly expands on the haunting narrative established in the first film. Joaquin Phoenix delivers another stunning performance, diving deeper into the complexities of Arthur Fleck's psyche. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the gritty essence of Gotham like the first while also highlighting the emotional turmoil of the characters. The soundtrack perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing every scene with its haunting melodies. The exploration of themes like mental health and societal neglect is both poignant and timely, making it a thought-provoking watch. Overall, Joker 2 is a cinematic triumph that leaves a lasting impact. If you enjoyed the first film then you should like this one too. This film isn't a masterpiece but it's well worth watching, my biggest complaint is that Gaga could have had more scenes."
1.0,4 October 2024,"It is an incredibly poor courtroom drama, an incredibly dull romance, an incredibly abysmal drama and thriller, and a terrible musical.

While this movie does have outstanding cinematography and visuals, with a continually great performance from Joaquin, it is just so terrible in every other aspect. The story feels like a complete waste of time and adds nothing while also destroying everything about the first movie. Fans of the first are going to hate this, and it certainly isn't going to bring in anyone new, either.

So it just raises the question of who exactly is this movie for?

This movie was an absolute joke."
1.0,13 October 2024,"I don't know where to start with this movie. Who in their right minds thought making Joker a musical was good? The songs are so repetitive and get really annoying when dialogue that could have been normally spoken is just sung. The acting is amazing throughout the film, and is full of emotion. The visuals are also decent, with the movie having good cinematography. The choreography is also good, but again, it isn't fitting in a Joker movie. Even if you ignore the fact that this is a musical, the worst thing about this movie is that it has basically no plot. The whole film just revolves around Arthur's court proceedings, nothing more, nothing less. The movie drags on so many scenes for so long just to add to the runtime. It also feels like Harley was added into the movie as a quick cash-grab because of how insignificant she was to the overall plot. This movie could have and should have been much better."
2.0,7 October 2024,"I LOVED the original Joker movie, so I had to see it with my own eyes if all the professional critics AND the audiences were correct in their harsh criticism of this movie. And YES, unfortunately 5 stars is a justified rating. Not terribly bad, but nonetheless a failed sequel.

The bad: let's forget about the songs for a moment, let's us only focus first on the spoken acting scenes. Are those any good? All the acting is done really well, BUT that doesnt make it an interesting, captivating or thrilling sequel, ON THE CONTRARY, the spoken acting scenes are incredibly BORING. Why? Because it's basically nothing more but a boring court room movie. NOTHING BUT BORING COURTROOM TALK. Who is gonna wanna watch that?!

More bad: NOW let's focus on the songs. The songs aint bad by itself either. Joaquin Phoenix CAN really sing and he has got a dark rough edge to his voice which gives the songs a nice dark twist, BUT unfortunately the songs dont add anything to the core of the movie and the songs are not that good that they stand out as a musical. So it's NEITHER a great musical (at all), NOR is it a thrilling movie, (if yoiu would only judge it by the spoken acting scenes).

It's a FLOP. I LOVED the original Joker movie and I am great fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this sequel (howewer well acted and sung) is a complete NOTHINGBURGER. Totally void of any real thrill or true drama. Such a bummer!"
3.0,3 October 2024,"This is the first movie that made me feel sleepy, though I'm not sure why. The storyline feels repetitive, even though it's hard to predict.

And thank you to everyone involved in the film. Honestly, all the Characters performed well, but perhaps it's just the storyline that makes this film not worth it. Truly feels like a lullaby. :)

Although I call this film a lullaby, I'm not saying the songs featured in it are bad. Believe me, all the songs are great, but once again, the storyline is a mess !!

As a viewer, I was hoping for a wow factor or a scene that could shake my sleepiness, but as time went on, it became increasingly boring."
10.0,5 October 2024,"This movie should named as Arthur Fleck. You don't go for å joker movie and watch joker for 10 min.

It's a comic book character. Don't do this for Clickbait.

Iam so disappointed with movie.

I writing this message after 4 days because I was mentally don't want to think how bad this movie is.

I would gave this move a better score if they called this movie for something else. But when they ruined the comic book character and did it purpose just for clickbait.

5.0,7 October 2024,"When it was announced that this film was going to be a musical, I fully expected for the whole world to love it, and I'd be the single human who hated every minute of it. Seemingly, we are in quite the opposite situation. I loved this film, and I suspect I know why most other people did not. I have a feeling 'Joker: Folie à Deux' will go down as one of the most misunderstood films of all time.

Where the misunderstanding is coming from, I believe, is that people think this is just another iteration of the 'Joker' that we have come to love over the years. It's not, and it never was. This is an entirely original character. This is not a 'Joker' who could mastermind heists, or set up master plans to bring down Gotham or go toe-to-toe with 'Batman'.

People didn't notice this as much in the original because it was an origin story. So they thought it normal that we wouldn't see all the theatrics we are used to from the 'Joker'. We are so used to sequels being bigger and bolder in every way that people thought this sequel would be him coming into his own, and doing all the things we have become used to seeing this character do.

So I think people went in with an expectation and didn't get anything remotely like what they expected/wanted, and for that reason deemed it a bad film. When in reality it is anything but. I can't imagine how Todd Phillips feels making a film this good, a film most directors could only dream of producing, and having the whole world criticise it.

The acting in the film is incredible. Both Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix are more than deserving of Oscar nominations, but it will be very interesting to see what the Academy does after the critical response the movie has received. It shouldn't matter, but it often does.

I'm not a big fan of musicals. And that was my least favourite part of the movie. Having said that, watching Gaga sing is rarely ever a bad thing. I could watch that all day. Phoenix on the other hand, not so much. Would I have preferred it not to be a musical? Yes. Did it ruin the film for me? No, but it certainly did hold it back from being a 10/10.

I have been immensely curious about this film ever since it was announced. Going in I really thought anything from a 1 to a 10 was on the cards. And then I just sat there loving every minute of it, and before I knew it 140 minutes had passed. I hope this film finds its audience along the way, even if it takes some time for people to appreciate it. 9/10."
3.0,3 October 2024,"That movie was a complete letdown. They turned the Joker into a character from a Disney musical, singing every few minutes like it's some PG8+ family flick. Absolutely nothing like the dark, twisted genius of Heath Ledger's portrayal in ""The Dark Knight."" It's painful to see such a complex character reduced to something so simplistic. This film not only wasted two hours of my life, but also tainted the legacy of one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. I can't believe they took such a gritty, compelling character and turned it into a light-hearted, sing-along disaster. What a disappointment."
5.0,4 October 2024,"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE JOKER 2

8.0,6 October 2024,"Todd Phillips took the title character in his 2019 film, which was successful and acclaimed in every way, and even won his actor an Oscar, plus Phillips was nominated for it, and then crumpled it up, stomped on it, and threw it in the trash! That's all that happened.

Why is this movie so bad? This makes more sense when you understand that this sequel probably wasn't meant to do well at the box office - I think it was intended to be a humiliation ritual to destroy the movie's legacy as punishment for it resonating with the ""wrong"" people.

As much as I was waiting for the film, I was waiting for it to end. It didn't turn out to be a two-person frenzy, it turned out to be a two-person disaster."
3.0,13 October 2024,"I have been reading some of these reviews and I truly feel people have missed the point completely. This movie was never a superhero movie or a standard linear ""story"". It is the experience of a deeply disturbed man wanting acceptance and meaning, there is no villain ""joker"" and there never has been. There is only a man trying to escape reality through his delusions, which are so well represented by music. I would recommend viewing this film from a completely different point of view, not as a story about Joker, but about Arthur. Once you embrace this the film opens up. You can never trust the narrator, you can't expect ""character development"", you do not get a happy ending. The Joke is on us, the audience, deluding ourselves and hoping for a cool supervillain, but receiving a disturbed weak mentally ill man.

This film is a true master peace in my mind."
5.0,6 October 2024,"Even though I had no faith in it, 2019's Joker surprised me, I did not know how good that movie was going to be, but if that existing meant we were going to get such a bad movie, then Todd Phillips shouldn't have ever been born. That hack and its writers have literally destroyed Joker at a molecular level.

This trifle of a ""film"" it is an insult to comic book fans, musicals. More than enraged I am insulted at the level of disregard to one of the greatest characters ever created.

The fault falls on Todd Phillips, Warner rothers and DC, they should never be allowed to make another film in their entire miserable lifespan.

I came into the movie wanting it to prove everyone wrong, to give me a sense of awe and marvel, instead I came out hating cinema at its very foundation, no movie in my entire life has made me feel this way.

Every copy of this film should be burn, destroyed and buried, along with the career if Todd Phillips, who does not deserve the privileges bestowed upon him.

Loving cinema sometimes means loathing it. I have seen more than my fair share of horse crap movies. But Joker: Folie à Deux is without the shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I ever seen in my entire life."
4.0,4 October 2024,"The movie felt boring and without the same emotional feel as the first: it just wasn't captivating and it focused too much on being a musical, which makes no sense, and the ending itself was utterly terrible, as it just didn't make any sense. There wasn't even a decent change of scenarios or diversity in plot points, it feels like the movie was produced within the spam of a week.

The whole idea of Joker was scrapped and the movie just carried on within the skelenton of the first 2019 movie, as it turned into what Napoleon ended up being: boring, too long and without any thrills. It's a shame we rarely get decent sequels nowadays,"
5.0,6 October 2024,"The film is all about lady gaga, do not watch this film. It's boring and the director thought by getting gaga in was a masterstroke BUT it certainly back fired. She CAN NOT act!! It's such a shame, the first movie was absolutely fantastic and myself and my wife were in florida at the time and went out of our way to go and watch this on the first day it was out.

We want our money back. There's a song every five minutes as gaga is in it and it really goes a different direction from the first movie.

The most overhyped and most forgettable movie I have ever had the displeasure of watching!!!!!!!!"
3.0,5 October 2024,"This movie really had my hopes high but the result was severely disappointing. There have been musical thrillers that are good and then there is this movie. The whole plot was negligible and can be summed up in 1min short(really). I failed the understand long scenes, it felt like music was forced and movie was around the the music. It should have been other way round. First you come up with a story and then tell it with music. Gaga failed to mesmerize with her voice too. The movie had enough smoke, colors and music but nothing that makes you like it. Utter waste of time would the phrase I would use for this movie.

Thanks."
8.0,3 October 2024,"This movie was a joke...

Gold class tickets booked, tick. Snacks ordered, tick. Excitement and anticipation, check.

Phoenix and Gaga were exceptional, as well as all the other actors.

However...

I had been looking forward to this movie since I found out its release, but found the movie to lack substance with an average plot. I have no idea why it was made into a musical?! Felt like the songs were a fantasy filler of Flecks mind.

Disheartened and disappointed.

For fans of the first movie I think the ratings unfortunately reflect a common theme.

Thanks for making this movie, but I personally think it was a flop and not to my liking."
3.0,20 October 2024,"The first film was a story about how we as a society treat and shun people and the effect it has. This film is about consequences.

Fleck is a broken man in prison, beaten, bullied and with no liberties, he escapes his pain by creating a world. Remember ""The Butterfly Effect"", in jail one of the guys says to Ashton Kusher's character ""you go to another place when they come for you"". This is the same here. Whenever he has a delusion, the colours appear and it goes from grey to colourful. This is when we know he has entered his ""parallel world"" to escape the pain of the real world.

The trial scene is monotonous but courtrooms are. But what we see is how the system is used against him.

At the end of the day the film is not an action film, or a romantic film, or a pleasant film. It is a film about how people with mental illness/challenges cope and create an alternative, colourful world where they are in control.

The lesson to learn about this film is how we can be kinder to people."
4.0,4 October 2024,"As someone who genuinely enjoyed the original Joker, I went into ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" with high hopes, but unfortunately, I left feeling conflicted. While Joaquin Phoenix still gives an intense performance and Lady Gaga brings her own unique energy, the movie feels scattered and lacks the depth that made the first film so captivating.

The choice to make this a musical, even as a huge musical fan, threw me off. It's such a strange medium for this kind of story. Some of the musical numbers work, but many feel misplaced or unnecessary, detracting from the tension and grit that defined the original. The music itself is well-executed, but the film doesn't fully commit to being a musical or a psychological thriller, and that left me feeling like it was trying to do too much without fully succeeding in either.

Ultimately, it was a strange mix of genres that left me feeling confused and underwhelmed, which is disappointing given how much I liked the original film."
5.0,5 October 2024,"This might be one of the hardest movie reviews I've written. I was shocked when every review for Joker: Folie à Deux came out negative, but after seeing it, I can understand why-especially when it comes to the ending.

To start, every other part of this sequel is decent, although it's a bit of a departure, taking on the feel of a love story musical. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a compelling performance, and Lady Gaga might just be the best Harley Quinn I've ever seen, the movie's heavy emphasis on dreamlike, musical sequences between Phoenix and Gaga caught a lot of people off guard. They spend a significant part of the film singing to each other, creating a surreal and often romantic atmosphere that's not what many fans were expecting.

But while I didn't mind the musical direction, the film's real downfall lies in its brutal ending. Without giving anything away, it's extremely graphic and feels so unnecessarily gruesome that it leaves a bad taste after an otherwise decent experience. It's uncomfortable to watch and definitely not suitable for younger viewers.

If you're planning to see Joker: Folie à Deux, go in with an open mind. There's a lot to appreciate, especially in the acting and musical approach, but prepare yourself-the ending is intense and could be off-putting for some."
5.0,3 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is the sequel to the 2019 superhero/supervillain film ""Joker"". Once again directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (""Road Trip"", ""Old School"", the ""Hangover"" trilogy) and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, it is an underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original that doesn't end up delivering what it promises.

Sometime after the events of the first film, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the murders and misdemeanors he caused years earlier. During his stay, Arthur struggles to deal with his duel identity as ""Joker"", unable to distinguish between his own actions and those of the destructive persona he created. As the media prepares to extensively cover the upcoming legal proceedings, Arthur meets Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a new patient at the Hospital who admires him as the Joker and as his own damaged self. Amidst the ensuing chaos of media scrutiny and public outcry, Arthur and Lee's infatuation with each other begins to grow, culminating in their mutual appreciation for the music inside of them.

I am always hesitant to refer to a movie as a ""modern masterpiece"", however, I firmly believe that 2019's ""Joker"" is well worthy of such an honour. This movie works not only as a fantastic contemporary origin story of one of the most famous comic book villains of all time but also as a social commentary on the human condition and the stigma of mental illnesses. As a result, the film managed to transcend the boundaries of your typical ""superhero"" movie, allowing audiences from all walks of life to take note of everything important it was trying to say. Although the film was clearly intended as a standalone feature, Warner Bros. Later decided to continue the story in the sequel ""Joker: Folie à Deux"", a decision that does not work in their favour as it fails to recapture nearly everything that made its excellent predecessor so impactful.

In the years since his arrest, we see that Arthur Fleck has now built up quite a notorious reputation throughout his new home at Arkham Asylum. His fellow inmates fear and respect him for the anarchy he was responsible for years ago, and the guards frequently taunt him into telling them a ""funny joke"" to cause his Joker personality to emerge. Yet in spite of all this acknowledgement he once deeply craved, Arthur remains relatively quiet and mostly keeps to himself. Occasionally, Arthur's signature pained laughing outbursts stemming from his condition may occur from time to time, but he does nothing about it until it eventually subsides. Later, we learn that Arthur is set to stand trial for his crimes, to which his law team try to argue that his actions were actually caused by his Joker persona, meaning he can enter an insanity plea and escape the death penalty. Though all of this seems like a solid way to begin a sequel to the original, what follows is where the film starts to fall apart from the seams.

During a therapy session, Arthur comes into contact with Lee, a seemingly troubled woman who claims to have burned down her parents' apartment building. The two form a connection with one another and come up with a plan to ""ditch this joint"" and go on the run. The way the film chooses to present this to us is through song, with the pair of them singing and dancing to pre-existing music. Normally, I wouldn't have minded this unorthodox addition to the film if it were handled properly, which unfortunately it isn't. The problem here is that none of the songs are all that memorable and don't really leave a lasting impression, and for a film that sets itself up as a musical, that is a major issue. Because of that, I never really felt as though these two were kindred spirits proclaiming their love for one another as much as a pair of weirdos singing along to music that only they can hear.

Another issue is that the film's screenplay lacks proper cohesion. In the original movie, every pivotal event that took place always flowed flawlessly from one scene to the next, with each character-focused moment communicating all of the necessary information back to the audience. Here, on the other hand, the plot feels so fragmented and inconsistent that it's difficult to fixate your attention on a particular scene without concern as to whether it will matter later on. For instance, in this one scene involving Arthur professing his love for Lee, he is shown doing so during a televised interview, which you'd assume would lead to something important immediately after. However, this is not the case, as it quickly ends and its relevance to the plot is never brought up again. There are several other moments like this which constantly tease the audience that something huge about to happen, only for it to disappear into thin air a short time later. After a while, this makes the film incredibly frustrating to watch.

To give credit where it is due, I really appreciate that the film was able to recreate the original's superb cinematography and visual style. I absolutely loved the dreary, gritty imagery that director Todd Phillips used in the first film, which gave it a very distinct look to help this 1980s version of Gotham City stand out from all of the others. Thankfully, this sequel follows suit in that regard, as there were moments that I thought were visually stunning. Without giving away spoilers, there was this one part that involved Arthur and Lee looking into each other's eyes with fire burning in the background. The blocking of this scene illuminates Arthur while Lee is mostly shown in the dark, symbolising the bright but destructive way she lights up his life. This proves that there was at least some creative thought put into this film from a visual standpoint, so it surprises me that virtually everything else falls flat in comparison.

Reprising one of the greatest roles of his career, Joaquin Phoenix does everything he can to remind us of why his performance in the original film is now ranked alongside Heath Ledger as among the best live action depictions of the Joker. However, in the grand scheme of things, it just simply isn't enough to save this film from the rest of its problems. Because of all the glaring faults in the film's screenplay, direction, and plot inconsistencies, it's near impossible to feel much empathy for Arthur this time around. His character does not do much aside from repeatedly yearn for Lee through song or make weak excuses for his criminal behaviour in the previous film. I missed all that anticipation and unpredictability of what Arthur would do next, as this was one of the key things that made him so interesting last time. Sadly, I never once felt any of that from this movie.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment, for me at least, was the utilisation of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn (a.k.a. Lee). In the lead up to the film's release, I was actually looking forward to seeing how Gaga would portray the Joker's female sidekick/love interest, as I thought she was a great choice to play this emotionally damaged character. Unfortunately, there's hardly anything memorable worth mentioning about her involvement in the story other than her thinking what Arthur did in the first movie was ""bold"" and ""brave"". This could have been the perfect time to provide a commentary on toxic relationships and why many imprisoned murderers have loyal female fans, but the film squanders all these moments away at every given opportunity. What we get instead is a rather two-dimensional story of a mentally ill man and a mentally ill woman who have no other reason to want to be together other than that they are both unstable people. To add insult to injury, Lee is hardly even in the film enough to leave a lasting impression, and considering she's supposed to be one of the main characters, this seems like a very bizarre creative decision.

For a follow-up to one of the greatest films of the 2010s, the only thing that ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" has done is prove that just because you can make a sequel, doesn't always mean that you should. After five years, I can still remember picking my jaw up from the floor in amazement after watching the first film, whereas with this one I was struggling to recall anything in great detail without the need to look it up online. Nobody is going to be playfully reenacting dance numbers from this movie and nobody is going to be quoting from it anytime soon like they did with its predecessor. In my humble opinion, Warner Bros. Should have left the original as a standalone film, as I think everything concluded perfectly then and there. It makes me think that this unnecessary sequel may just be one big joke at our expense. If it is, then I don't get it.

I rate it 5/10."
4.0,9 October 2024,"A lot of audience was waiting for this movie I bet that no one could have ever imagined it will be that bad

Very boring lots of songs a big why should be asked, totally not related to a gotham villain.

I wish one day any of the film producers will let the fans why they turned a masterpiece (part I) a long awaited in such thing for me it is an undefined thing, even joaquin phoneix was seen in a video telling lady gaga that Joker: folie a deux is a horrible movie she thought he was joking but he said it is really really horrible

Finally Joquin phoneix deserved a much better script/story/movie/production whatever it should be named as he was the only good thing in this mess."
9.0,6 October 2024,This was clearly not a DC fan film it's more like a GAGA movie musical I can't... this movie was a ridiculous it was a joke it didn't match the first one at all. This movie made Joker look weak. This made no sense it feels like the movie was changed and I don't know why I don't know if it has to do with all the stuff happening in Hollywood. It makes no sense we need answers a complete waste of time. I had to rewatch the first Joker to get the bad taste out my mouth. The biggest let down in dc history. I can only hope they release a statement with an explanation and what the plans are to rewrite the film and give us what we expected. This is unacceptable to say the least.

4.0,18 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, despite its high expectations. While the first film captivated audiences with its gritty realism and deep character exploration, this sequel strays into muddled territory that leaves much to be desired.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance once again, and Lady Gaga shows promise as Harley Quinn. However, their chemistry often feels forced, overshadowed by an erratic script that struggles to find a clear direction. The film attempts to blend psychological drama with musical elements, but this fusion often results in a disjointed experience. The musical numbers, while ambitious, disrupt the flow and detract from the darker themes that made the original so compelling.

Pacing is another significant issue. Many scenes drag on, testing the audience's patience and making the film feel longer than necessary. The lack of action is glaring; what could have been a thrilling exploration of madness instead feels like a slow crawl through repetitive character moments.

Visually, the film maintains a striking aesthetic, but style alone cannot carry the weight of a story that often feels aimless. While it touches on interesting themes, they are not developed enough to resonate meaningfully.

Overall, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a disappointing sequel that fails to capture the raw intensity and emotional depth of its predecessor. It feels like an experiment that doesn't quite land, leaving fans of the original feeling frustrated and underwhelmed."
4.0,5 October 2024,"Probably the worst movie I have seen in 5 years, and trust me, I have seen horrible movies in the last 5 years. THIS IS NOT A JOKER FILM. This is a film that pretends the protagonist is Joker. This is not even a film, it's a movie. Unnecessary songs, uneven plot, unengaging themes, under utilisation of Harley, this film has one redeeming factor, shots look good. This sequel wasn't needed, and now here we are, with a half baked monetization attempt to capitalise on the first one's success. It was released in IMAX. For What?? It costed 200 Million $. For What?? Garbage that is this movie? Disappointed."
1.0,5 October 2024,"This film could have been so much more. After the masterpiece that was the first film, this was just disappointing. There were so many angles this could have gone. Especially when talking about mental health disorders. The portrayal of the disorder could have gone deeper. The failings of the system were grazed over. The ball was dropped in several scenes. However, the acting was phenomenal. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga did their best with what they were given. Unfortunately, the storyline just didn't hold up. The musical additions made sense but went on for far too long. It felt like fluff and didn't really add anything to the film. It just left much to be desired and they should have left well enough alone with the first film."
9.0,5 October 2024,"The previous movie succeed in making Arthur Fleck in becoming the Joker. This movie really brings Arthur Fleck into just an ordinary - mentally illed person.

Arthur Fleck was more likely becoming a high school boy falling in love, then had a bad ending. Joker really shown as someone being played with, and i thought he would not deserve that. Harley Queen herself was being too forced to be a figure who influences the mind.

I have expected the movie to bring out both of the character influences each person in a more chaotic way to the public. But it was just high school boy and girl playing love."
4.0,15 October 2024,"Friends and peers alike have mostly lambasted the film however I stand in direct opposition to their assessment's.

A lover of the first movie, I did see some loyalties to the grit and darkness throughout Joker 2.

The musical aspect - whilst not going to trouble the charts - was actually a welcome addition to the plot as the entire film was more or less confined to a life behind bars just like Mr Fleck.

All in all, not as good as the last film but a good watch nonetheless, glad I did not listen to others and seen it for myself.

After all, the beauty of cinema is interpretation.

Try it with an open mind, you won't regret it - I hope."
5.0,9 October 2024,"What else is there to say from the headline? I am not sure there are words to describe how disappointingly dull this movie is.

I genuinely think that when it came to filming, someone read the script and thought oh my god this is going to be a 1/10, proceeded to hire Lady Gaga and turn it into a musical to abuse her gifted voice.

The thing is, although I genuinely dislike musicals, I doubt anyone found enjoyment in this one... between Gaga & Joaquin, there must be at least 14 singing scenes and a good few of them are at least 2 minutes long with no real thought for the wind up to the singing nor the song choice.

Dull, Boring, cringe, lack of creativity. The crazy thing is both Todd Phillips and Scott Silver have some hits under their belt, they will need to out out something special as their next project because this film is a stain on their reputation."
3.0,11 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux retains the technical prowess of the original in an otherwise dreary, messy, and contrived follow-up. While the story of the first movie was told on a surface level, this one tries to be more complex and pushy in its storytelling but the result is somehow emptier than its predecessor. Once again, the cinematography is beautiful and the score is great. Joaquin Phoenix continues to be fantastic as Arthur Fleck and while I respect them trying to dig deeper with his character, it isn't interesting this time around. Lady Gaga is great as Lee Quinzel. However, her character is underwritten and the relationship between her and Joker isn't all that captivating. It doesn't help that there's barely any chemistry between Gaga and Phoenix. The musical sequences are fine but they didn't add anything and they got tiresome after a while. Speaking of things that got tiresome, the courtroom scenes are aimless and go nowhere. This is going to leave audiences divided, baffled, and infuriated (understandably so). As someone who didn't love the first film and had hope for this film, I found this follow-up to be tedious and mostly unneeded even if it has a few interesting moments. Sure, it's well made and acted but it's nothing but a hollow feature. Also, what was that ending? Seriously, it came out of nowhere."

2.0,8 October 2024,"I was the only person in the cinema watching this which makes me think the bad reviews are catching on. Simply put, i hoped that most people just weren't getting it and my cinephile brain would see the art that others couldn't . There were moments I hoped too much against the wisdom of the masses. I thought 'Is this genius or is it rubbish?' At an hour and a bit of this pointless nonsense, I walked out , settling on the latter. I actually felt insulted. Don't use comic book IP to sell your high school musical flamboyance. It feels like I was scammed by a website pretending to be a quality brand."
10.0,6 October 2024,"What a disappointment.

After the success of the first Joker movie, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a lackluster follow-up. It doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, nor does it stand on its own as a compelling sequel.

Rather than truly building on the foundation of the original, it rehashes familiar ideas while awkwardly attempting to introduce new ones-and it fails on both fronts. The potential for greatness is there, buried somewhere in the concept, but it never fully materializes.

I think the idea of focusing on a trial could have worked. In fact, it might have been better suited as a limited series, giving the narrative room to breathe and develop. Instead, as a film, it ends up feeling rushed and disjointed.

It's a shame that a film with so much promise ultimately falls flat, adding little to the story and tarnishing the legacy of what was once a standout movie."

5.0,6 October 2024,"Just when you thought that cinema could not screw up comic book characters and multigenerational storylines any more than they Have, along comes this poor excuse for a I don't know what.

If there'd been no such thing as DC comics, and if there'd been no such characters as the Joker or, one I care for less, Harley Quinn, this movie could be possible. Phoenix is a tremendously talented character and the supporting cast seemed OK but that it is based on traditional DC heritage quality characters and settings. I find it offensive - as a fan.

Beyond my fanaticism for the medium, I have no qualifications to regard this piece of cinema for its cinematic qualities or otherwise so I'll leave it at that.

There's only been a handful of decent superhero movies ever made, and this sure ain't one of them."
3.0,6 October 2024,"This second installment of Joker, Folie à Deux, is not only an artistic betrayal but also an affront to the legacy of the iconic character that is the Joker. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the film seeks to demystify and disarm what makes the Clown Prince of Crime so great and terrifying. The Joker, in his original form, is the embodiment of pure chaos, a being whose complete lack of remorse and conscience is his strength and allure. Yet, this film makes the tragic mistake of over-humanizing him.

By showing him vulnerable, filled with doubts, remorse, and regrets, the film strips away what makes him so magnetic: his absolute refusal to conform to societal rules, his relentless nihilism. The audience is faced with a broken man, sick, tormented by his identity, which not only breaks with what the character represents but is also deeply disappointing for those expecting to see the Joker we know and fear.

This approach, far from adding depth, actually dilutes the complexity of the Joker. Where pure and unpredictable madness once reigned, we are now subjected to clumsy introspection that betrays not only the character's DNA but also the essence of what made the first installment so successful. The Joker is not a man to be understood or excused; he is a force of disorder, the very personification of chaos.

In the end, this film feels more like a disjointed psychological exploration, a spin-off that might have been interesting for another character but certainly not for the Joker. In trying to make him more ""human,"" the film removes everything that makes him unique and terrifying. A weakened, lost Joker, unable to recognize himself in his own actions, is a true insult to the legacy of this iconic character."
4.0,5 October 2024,"The first act started strong and starts to plummet slowly from there. Joaquin adds another amazing performance to his career along with Lady Gaga who shows her voice in her approach to Harley Quinn. The movie suffers from an overly artistic approach with a slow and boring, but visually appealing narrative. The film doesn't payoff in almost anything it set up and ends up feeling like it fell short when it didn't have to. The most clear issue is the pacing and placement of the musical scenes. I understand the unique approach that the genre had to offer, but I think it's not utilized correctly and it makes it more difficult to chew and feel slower. It had great potential to be a powerful sequel, but ends up falling short due to poor pacing, an underwhelming plot, but great performances that leave the film with at least one thing to praise. 4/10."
4.0,6 October 2024,"This movie was not a Joker movie. It is a movie about a person that thinks he is the Joker and by accident the makers had access to Lady Gaga. So lets use her singing talent to let her sing as much as possible...

The first hour, the movie builds up and could be a great intro to finally action from the Joker. The first hour of the movie, i would give it a 8+. But somehow the story writers probably thought; lets not make it a Joker movie after a hour. Lets just make it a court movie with a person who thinks he is the Joker and a woman that thinks she is Lee( she dresses way to nice to come close to the character). For me the movie was really good till the part when Arthur and Lee go out the prison due to a fire. But then the movie turns into a theatre show. With way to much singing, you could hear the people in the cinema sigh when one of the persons start singing again after that part. We expected finally to see the real Joker and the chemical relation with Lee. What was building up till that fire.

The way how the movie was shot, the quality of the characters are high and the setting in the movie is great. But....

It is save to say, the movie is not what it should be and it is a waste of the crew that played in this movie. Joker, the first movie was a master piece.

Joker folie a deux is not about the Joker. Its a rip off..."
9.0,3 October 2024,"On earth what I just watched! Why i cant rate this zero? I literally felt it's Musically movie, and they sequence of the actions were very dump, like, not filled with anything! Not even ideas that's the movie will explain at the end, and the while time Im watching, its just new story! I was disturbed by the questions in my head because I read the full comics about the joker and this is NOT the story! Its new to me!! Anddd not ever suited the Joker character or personality! Oh waisted.... Very disappointing Very disappointing Very disappointing Very disappointing Very disappointing Very disappointing."
3.0,1 October 2024,"This movie was fantastic, but only for 2 hours. The musical element was actually really creative and clever, I really enjoyed it, and the acting was phenomenal. The cinematography was just as good, if not, better than the first, HOWEVER, my biggest and only issue with this movie is the last 15 minutes. An incredibly well written, well shot, well acted near-masterpiece falls flat because of the ending. It makes it feel almost as if the whole movie was useless, and I found myself leaving the theater really disappointed. It is absolutely worth seeing, but if they somehow find a way to make one, I will not be watching a third Joker movie. 8.5/10."

3.0,3 October 2024,"I went into this curious and open to it apparently being a musical, but I feel kind of conned. I guess the joke's on me. As a musical, it falls really flat, and there's only so much heavy lifting Lady Gaga's voice can do. It made me wish I was rewatching Chicago instead, and Dancer in the Dark is a better crime/courtroom musical too.

Joker: Folie a Deux feels provocative in an empty way, whereas the divisive original movie felt like it had a bit more to say and said it in a way that was often clear and engaging. This sequel is all over the shop, but not in a fun or varied way.

The pacing is quite shoddy, and the interestingly grungy world of the first movie doesn't get explored much here, owing to so much of the film being set in a maximum security psychiatric facility or a courtroom. The fantasy sequences wear out their welcome after a very short while. There's little rhyme or reason as to when they appear and why.

Joaquin Phoenix is good, but the performance feels lacking compared to the first seeing as the material lets him down. Lady Gaga does her best, but she's given far less to work with here than expected. No one gives an abysmal performance by any means, but no one has what they need to excel. The writing here feels lazy, and it hurts the actors.

I'm a little more positive on how it looks. Some of this visually gives the film a pulse here and there. And though the songs aren't implemented well, the score here is excellent, courtesy of Hildur Guðnadóttir once again.

I wanted to come away admiring the film going for broke and indulging in a genre lots of people seem to resist or outright reject. I feel that's what most people are going to latch onto and dislike by default with this film. I like musicals, though. I just don't really like this musical. Intriguing in theory but disappointing in execution."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I was hoping to see Joker go off the deep end, but instead I saw a ""musical"". Don't know whose idea this was to turn it into one, but I was totally disappointed by the plot. The court scenes were the best part along with the guards hassling him, but otherwise don't even bother wasting your time or money on this.

Joakim Phoenix does a good job reprising his role as Joker, but Lady Gaga's casting had me puzzled when it was announced. I thought she would've truly stand out in the movie, but instead we get showtunes instead of a gritty mind-boggling thriller that I believe everyone was hoping for. This one will be a money loser for Warner."

4.0,16 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is the sequel to the first Joker film from 2019. This sequel is again decided and partly written by Todd Phillips, who also decided the first part.

Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is stuck in Arkham in his criminal actions that he has recorded as Joker, waiting for his trial. During this waiting, Artur is struggling with his other identity of Joker. With the help of his passion for music and a new flirt Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), he tries to choose which of his two personalities deserves control.

After the financial success of the first Joker film, Todd Phillips has come up with enough ideas to make a sequel. For example, he tries to see Arthur deal more with his actions as Joker in the first part of the film and with his trial in the second part. The first part comes across as a prison drama film and the second half more as a criminal drama. During both parts, the time is filled with musical scenes, singing and dancing. With these musical aspects they try to fill the emotional spaces, but they could have done this with the acting of the cast. The musical aspects sometimes suddenly come forward and sometimes suddenly feel like you are watching something else. This allows the film to overcome a big and chaos.

Todd Phillips manages to portray these different moments and aspects beautifully and fittingly, but he still misses a good connection between these scenes, which means that there are multiple sides during the film due to the creation. While thinking up and writing the inspiration script, he and the other writer Scott Silver still came up with suggestions, which took the film in different directions a few times. In this way, the film sometimes comes across as a bit uncertain, apart from the scattered sides, and they ultimately do not know exactly what they want to achieve with this sequel. Sometimes it seems that with new elements from this sequel they also go against the first part and thus undermine the first part itself.

This is the first time that Joaquin Phoenix plays in a sequel to a film series. He largely manages to portray the role well and can add something extra through the musical aspects. The organized and contradictory aspects unfortunately also work against him and his character. As a singer, Lady Gaga knows how to use the musical aspects to her advantage. The smaller aspects do not provide enough space for her character, so that she cannot do much with them or make much of them. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga also work best together when they sing and dance a musical together. In other scenes, they come across more as a fan and star of each other, who through fame and desire know how to blind each other until ultimately deceive each other."
3.0,16 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux felt unnecessary and lacked any real climax. The film mainly rehashed elements of the first movie, but adding musical numbers didn't improve the story. I enjoy musicals, but the songs here didn't contribute to the plot. Lady Gaga tried to make her role relevant, but her character was poorly written, and many of her acting scenes were cut. It's unfair that fans blame Gaga for the film's shortcomings, when Joaquin Phoenix himself returned to the role after several disappointing films post-Oscar. This was a missed opportunity where Gaga could've had a much stronger impact. Despite the flaws, Gaga's vocals, especially on songs like ""Build a Mountain"" and ""Close to You,"" were outstanding, though I'm not too hopeful for an Oscar for ""Folie à Deux""."
3.0,6 October 2024,"The plot of the movie is quite boring as the movie was almost only filming about how the Joker's life in jail but not many about the Joker himself and the Lee

The movie cannot reach my expectation as I expected the movie would filming more about Joker and Lee's relationship and how to bring chaos to the world as they should seems the world as stage as the tagline had told.

However, the music is good which is memorable and more attractive than the movie itself.

In my opinion, the movie should use 'Joker' as the main character as the movie is not really talk about the the story of Joker. If the story is using another character as the main character with some amendment to the movie. Then, the movie would be much better."
3.0,6 October 2024,"The only thing that prevents me for giving this movie a 0/10 it's the fact that at least the cinematography, the performances, (especially the Joaquin Phoenix one) and the direction looks great.

But overall, the story and the script are so absurdly awful, with the whole musical scenes becoming tedious by the end of the first act of the movie.

Also, the story doesn't progress because of it due to the constantly interruption between scenes for the sake of having a damn song in it.

This movie should have never been a musical in the first place.

And the worst of all, the plot itself is just a humiliation ritual for the Joker, reverting his whole character arc to the place where he was in the beginning of the first movie, and finally, leaving him with an specially terrible third act that the only thing it accomplishes it's making one of the most iconic supervillains in the history of the superhero comics into a weak and pathetic man.

Anyways, please don't waste your time or money in this horrible sequel that it shouldn't have even existed, and watch something else."
9.0,8 October 2024,"I wanted to love this film. I don't like superhero movies or comics (DC or Marvel). I loved the first film. I had no expectations on the film or plot.

I thought even if this ends up being a court room musical (as ppl were claiming) - that tbh sounded great. I love musicals and broadway. I have (and loved) working at a real courthouse. This honestly sounded like a dream sequel.

Despite this - The movie isn't bad, but it sure isn't good. The movie is a bit too pretentious for its own good. It also does Lady Gaga no favors. The music was not good, nor was it supposed to be.

The plot isn't even awful, it's just so incredibly slow bc of the music. The music did not add a ton to the plot, and that is problematic. In the first film his delusions added to the plot. The singing added to the plot but by the 4th-5th-6th songs the point was beyond made. Cool this is what yall wanted? Then yah, expect to flop. And when ppl who love musicals still don't like it, ya know it's a true flop.

The first movie will remain a standalone and a stellar one at that. I truly like the idea of what they were going for here but it just wasn't done well at all.

Also, a film that purposely tries to piss ppl off isn't ever good for business. And yes, this is a business. I wouldn't pretend otherwise. It's okay to like this film. It's also okay to not like it. It's not bad. But it's also not great."
3.0,4 October 2024,"I created an account to vent my praise against the many negative voices. It's not what I expected, but it doesn't bother me because it still fascinated me. I loved so much more than I have to criticize. In an overstimulated society, where all that is expected is to go the extra mile, this movie takes the time and talks through posture, gestures and facial expressions, composition, music and so much more. I had a lot to discover and interpret.

I was warned that going to the movies would be a waste. I sat in the theater and expected it to finally become unbearable. But that didn't happen. Don't be swayed."
3.0,9 October 2024,"When I first heard Lady Gaga was going to star in the film. I was disappointed. I didn't think she'd fit in the world at all. But figured I'd wait to see the film to really judge it. I was wrong, she done alright. Her character was lackluster and the singing drove me mad. But there was moments with her that was like seeing Joaquin in a certain light in the first joker film where you could see they could be great in the role. But the next scene would take it all away and then some.

Not sure why Todd went this way with the movie. It starts off bad and kind of stays on the bad line throughout the film. I could say its a unique perspective of the Joker and certain scenes kind of feel like the first movie. But then it's washed away with bad singing and feels like I'm watching a bad gaga music video. Think it was a terrible idea to do this to Joker. Specially how good the first Joker film was as well as Matt Reeves Batman. They could've combined that universe, gave joker his criminal empire and brought along new villains in a new, dramatic way. But they gave us this crappy ""musical"". ."

Rather than being the big clever moment someone in the production team envisaged, all it does it rub salt into a wound already scabbing from boredom. This film is trying desperately hard to be clever and I'm sure there'll be people trying desperately hard to be thought of as clever who will spend pages explaining why it is, but it just isn't.

It's an opportunity wasted and the only reason to not leave the cinema is Phoenix's immense acting talent that at least makes the character believable."
1.0,4 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" stumbles under the weight of its own ambition, delivering a muddled blend of musical whimsy and psychological drama that never quite hits the mark. While visually arresting at times, the film's disjointed narrative and ill-conceived tonal shifts leave it feeling more like a chaotic experiment than a cohesive sequel. The once sharp edge of the original is dulled by an overindulgence in spectacle, without the emotional payoff to justify it. Fans looking for a worthy follow-up to the first film will likely be disappointed by this uneven, perplexing journey. Ambitious but disjointed."
9.0,9 October 2024,"A very silly follow up to the first film, really going to annoy people, not what was required, a huge budget and platform and this is the best he could have done ? I mean it is not terrible but its so drab and uninteresting for most part, hard to fathom out why the director wasted such a big opportunity, The one redeeming light was Lady Gaga, I have never seen her in a movie before but she was very very good in this, Phoenix was obviously good too but that is to be expected from such a talented actor, none of this can hide the fact that this was a poor effort and a mostly tedious , nothing to say offering."
4.0,9 October 2024,""" Joker: Folie à Deux ""

Watch the movie with your own eyes not others , when I watched it for the first time I thought I would watch a bad and boring movie but in reality the movie is amazing I enjoyed every second.

After watching the movie, I was surprised by this harsh attack, as if public taste has become bad or that most people are influenced by the opinions of others, in my opinion this movie is the best in this year.

The story, the direction, the acting, the songs, the cinematography, the music, the depth of the material, everything felt like a massive piece of work that was mastered.

Thanks to Todd Phillips for making this art."
1.0,6 October 2024,"Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it's off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist's story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture's first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film's second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren't enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre - musicals - to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you've got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that's heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren't enough to make a good picture overall; what's stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that's where the movie falls apart. In my view, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" isn't as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn't mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy ""Ho hum, so what?"" And that's regrettable, given that the character and this picture's predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven't seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture's genuinely stellar trailer, as that's ultimately much better than most of what's found in this clunky 2:18:00 release."

1.0,5 October 2024,"Bad execution, no storyline whatsoever and a clear attempt by hollywood to milk as much money from unsuspecting movie goers. The whole film centers around prison and a courtroom which is as dry as watching paint dry.

The film has no plots and the singing was barely even good enough for screen. I wish i read and trusted the reviews before watching.

Well done for the marketing team and the team that made the trailers, they certainly oversold the film and turned what was a dud of a film into an ""anticipated"" event.

As a gotham fan, i would recommend the Penguin on streaming as it offers much more excitement."
4.0,4 October 2024,"You can argue whether a sequel to Joker was ""necessary"" or not. Since it was made, the only thing I care about is if it is a good film or not. Unfortunately, other than a few obvious positives, only one thing stands out as being good, and it completely goes against the entire film. The worst thing about the sequel is how bored you are while watching everything that was and anything that could've been play out in front of you.

The opening animation tells us, in Peter Pan fashion, that Arthur Fleck is part himself and part Joker. The rest of the film is tries to answer the question if Joker is schizophrenic or not, ultimately deciding whether he will receive the death penalty for the five murders he committed in the previous movie. Or is it to find out if he's guilty? Surely he doesn't have a chance at being freed. Does he plan on escaping prison? In the meantime he develops a romance with not Harley Quinn. Is this believable? No. But it has to happen to ultimately lead us...who knows. The romance is not believable nor do we know what to believe about it since multiple scenes happen that the movie fails show whether they are reality or just in his head. It's a jumbled mess that Todd Phillips doesn't care about, nor did I.

The story, or lack thereof, was directionless. I can certainly extrapolate ideas about what it is trying to say, but it doesn't explore any of these to their extent. They are boring to begin with, then fail to resolve. Sure, it looks good. Some of the acting is fine. But this is to be expected and only serviced me to not go completely insane myself with the meandering story that never evolved until the tedious ending which only serves to not wrap up anything, but proves there was nothing to wrap up other than telling you that the most honest part of the film was the first three minutes. I don't recommend seeing this to see how bad it is. Skip it entirely."
9.0,4 October 2024,"Went into this movie with really high hopes but have honestly never been more disappointed and let down in my entire life. Doesn't go more than 15 minutes without breaking into song and dance the entire film. I have no clue why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this into a musical. It tries to be edgy and alternative and as a result the movie is a steaming pile of rubbish. My favorite part was joker told lady gaga to stop singing. It was like he finally realized how God damned annoying it was. If I could choose to erase this movie from my memory, so I had only seen the first one I would.

Wouldn't recommend this to anyone that is not also a fan of high-school musical."

It's the rare film that is both weird and boring, to a degree that it's hard to imagine anyone enjoying it. Even if the movie's ambitions are admirable, you might end up too bored to care. Very little happens beyond those walls, reducing the film to cramped psychodrama. It's startlingly dull, a pointless procedural that seems to disdain its audience. If the principal actors weren't so watchable, the movie would be an outright bore.

My Rating : 3/10."

2.0,10 October 2024,"Despite the negative buzz, I decided to see this film on the big screen, hoping to judge it for myself. Like many, I was skeptical about turning the Joker story into a musical, though I was willing to give it a fair shot. Unfortunately, the film falls short in several key areas.

The musical aspect, intended to give insight into the Joker's psyche, quickly becomes overdone and tedious. While the songs could have been an interesting way to explore the character's inner world, they focus almost exclusively on the love story between Joker and Harley Quinn, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into his madness. There's one brief moment-10-minutes in a scene (where the Joker also sings about something other than love)- that captures a glimpse of the eccentric madness from the first film. For that short stretch, the movie shows what it could have been, but it ultimately slips back into disappointment.

The overuse of scenic shots, an excessive focus on a fictional trial that takes up a third of the movie, and the endless musical numbers make the film feel drawn out. By the end, I was eager for it to finish. Despite my best efforts to play devil's advocate, I left the theater completely aligned with the wave of criticism.

The only real highlight is the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, who fully commit to their roles as Gotham's infamous crime couple. Sadly, even their excellent portrayals couldn't save the film."
2.0,8 October 2024,"Hollywood can't make up its mind. Is it a Batman Movie? Is it about mental illness? Pulled from too many pots. And the viewer pays the non-refundable service charge. Hard to comprehend why it is still being tied to the Batman franchise. Now adding ""Harley Quinn"". Maybe this will teach us all a lesson in sequel lore. Doubtful there will be a J-3 mop up. Curious what the audience thought about where the plot was going anyway? Adding in Lady Gaga was supposed to cinch it shut; I didn't really feel her contribution.

Maybe ""Penguin-2"" will be better... with maybe a cameo from Danny DeVito! Not impressed with this cash grab."
10.0,4 October 2024,"This Film may have been the most frustrating film I have ever watched, First off the first film ""Joker"" Was terrific & should have stayed that way, Todd Philips delivered... But Todd Philips decided to be Todd Philips and make another wasteful sequel to a great stand alone story. I had low expectations but dear God it was worse than that! It is a musical... That doesn't work! The dark tones the first Joker film had that made it so special and feel so good are ruined here. This is basically how the musical works, Remember when Arthur Fleck discovered those papers indicating he was adopted and Tortured as a child in the first film? Imagine if he discovered that and just started cheerfully signing after that... That's what this movie is! It was so painful that is why it was a kick to the brain. I don't know if I feel stupid for trying to think this would be decent or Stupid not to see the clear money grab Todd Philips just robbed of me. Please, appreciate solo stories."
2.0,5 October 2024,"For those hating on this movie, my first question for them would be, who is Arthur Fleck? My second would be why does this film require violence to drive it's narrative?

I think both these are the questions the director wants us to ask ourselves.

This is not a joker movie, it's an Arthur movie.

On the violence, there is a moment in the film where Arthur says, ""I know what you really want"" and it's the first moment of violence in the film. It's at this same point as a viewer I also thought to myself after 3 songs, where is the gut rench of the original, which at the same point in the run time would have already had the train attack scene. Which made me question myself, I've enjoyed it so far, why am I waiting for violence, is this what I really want too? There is so much in this movie, I think it's brilliantly done and will be in film schools being critically analysed in years to come.

Without giving anything away the final question to ask would be. Who is the Joker? Which has some subtle references bookended at the beginning and end of the film, to help answer this question."
4.0,5 October 2024,"There are many issues with the film, though it had great cinematography and decent music (if I heard the music separate from this movie). Here are the reason why I believe this film failed.

1) The plot was pointless, 2) way too much singing, and, for having been a fan of the first film, 3) this sequel just fell... flat. After watching this film you'll leave the theater with only one question: ..... why? Just why make it a musical? Why let it drag on for hours for a seemingly inexplicable plot? Why not give the fans what they bleeping deserve?

It's too bad, because it had potential to be a great film."
4.0,6 October 2024,"Unfortunately Hollywood disappeared up its own backside with this one, in spite of its audience. An expensive and unnecessary folly where they would have known how bad it was on a test screening, but must have closed their eyes and blocked up their ears (like the poor viewer will wish to do so). The actors can't save it, despite trying, as I swear that Tommy Wiseau might have offered a better story and direction. It will offend most fans of the first film, who will be told by some sycophants that 'the art is symbolic of the self delusion' and goes over their little heads... *A woeful excuse..."
2.0,5 October 2024,"5 years ago, I wrote a review here about a movie so good, I had to go in Theaters to watch it twice. Joker is still an amazing movie. My expectations for the sequel were reserved, but this really isn't it.

Movie is downright boring, Instead of character development we see a character decline, and the musical parts are mostly cringe. I gave Lady Gaga benefit of doubt (her involvment in ""A Star is Born"" made for a solid movie), but this really isn't working, at least for me.

I'm trying to be as objective as possible, not everything was bad: Actor performances were really good, the cinematography is great and even the musical (as much as I don't like them) had some logic and clever execution to it. The movie actually even surprised me a bit once...

Long story short; this movie is really unnecessary.

Will gladly watch Joker (2019) again at some point, but watching this one once was more then enough."
1.0,14 October 2024,"Why this plot and script was ever green-lit is insanity. Who is the target guidance for this movie? The answer is no one. It's a shame because the acting is top notch. I think this directors future projects need to be heavily reviewed before being green lit and put into production.

I honestly don't think this deserves to be watched. If you feel like you must watch it, go into it thinking it's going to be horrible and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised that it's just really really bad and 1 step short of horrible lol

This was a total waste of time and money. To be kind, this should have went direct into streaming so at least you can change the channel and your not stuck in a movie theater."

1.0,8 October 2024,"About to drop possibly the hottest take of the year. Joker: Folie à Deux is...

A MASTERPIECE

I know this is a crazy take but I believe it to be a true one. This film DOES NOT deserve the hate it's getting whatsoever. It's fun, it's emotional, it's deep, it's cinematic, it's beautiful, it's honestly one of the best films of the year in my opinion. Phoenix and Gaga give fantastic performances like I expected they would. Phoenix is just too good in this role. I cannot overstate how good this film's cinematography is. It should be nominated at the Oscar's no doubt. There's a shot in here near the beginning that absolutely blew me away, it was so well done and beautiful I had to make a remark to the friend I was watching it with. This film is masterfully directed by Todd Philips, I can't wait to see his next film now that he's done with DC. Yes, there's a lot of musical numbers (don't know what everyone is complaining about because we knew it was going to be a musical for awhile), but they are executed in a good but also chaotic and unique way that makes it feel like it's going on in Arthur's head. Plus, Arthur finding an escape through music makes a lot of sense in the context of the film. Harley Quinn being the analogy for those who got obsessed with Joker, both in real life and the movie, was well played. I'm sorry, but those that find solace in characters like Joker, Patrick Bateman and other psychopaths deserve to be mocked. She liked the idea of Joker but not the person underneath, much like people similar to her in real life. The movies story isn't anything mind blowing, but it was still good. I was hooked the entire time and the film managed to get me pretty emotionally invested. I could honestly probably go on for longer but overall, I have to say, despite popular opinion, I loved this film. Joker: Folie à Deux might pass up Civil War for the most polarizing film of the year but that leads me to say this: go see this movie and do not form an opinion until after you've seen it. You may be like me and absolutely love it. I have to say again, It does not deserve the hate it's getting or the low Cinemascore it received. Joker: Folie à Deux is the most artsy comic book movie out there, so go see it and get in on the conversation."

2.0,4 October 2024,"After being deeply moved by Joaquin Phoenix's remarkable portrayal of the iconic character in the epic ""Joker,"" I was eagerly anticipating another exceptional depiction. However, I was disappointed to find that ""Joker Folie A Deux"" was nowhere near as compelling. It was so far from being a good cinematic experience that I cried after coming back from the movie theater. The only saving grace was Joaquin Phoenix's incredible acting. Lady Gaga's performance was also decent. The musical aspect was not a good idea, and the direction, screenplay, and storytelling were disappointing. Save yourself from this embarrassment that is ""Joker Folie A Deux."""
1.0,5 October 2024,"Should not have watchet the second movie, I wasted more than two hours of my life and the reason I gave this movie a 5 is because of the first one and because I like Joaquin Phoenix , I don't know what is happening, either I am getting old or the new movies keep getting worse, the story is bad, there are loose ends. Too much singing and dancing for my taste, the singing is happening so often it gives you a feeling of anxiety. Joker did nothing notable, the iconic laugh was very rare, there are 2 scenes that are worth watching in the whole 2 and something hours and the ending is very bad, the focus should have been more on the crazy inseparable couple, that would bring the destruction of Gotham, Harley has more guts than Joker, he is like a whimp."
2.0,6 October 2024,"I was looking forward to the release of this film as I enjoyed the first one so much. But this film is so so bad it has even put me off of watching the first one again sometime as I'm sure I would be reminded of what a car crash this one is. I may even need therapy. Never have i felt more like scraping my eyes out with a rusty spoon. First of all, is this a musical? Every 10 minutes they burst into a song. It added nothing. It just made it a long, long bore fest. The story is weak and the acting, well what can I say? Lady Gaga can't act, pure and simple. She completely destroyed the Harley Quinn character for me. I could go on but even by just thinking about this film and what I sat through is making me lose the will to live. Do yourself a favor, don't bother going to see this film."
8.0,6 October 2024,"I really love the first Joker film and I was very keen to see this film and see how it develops the Joker's descent into madness. I didn't watch a trailer or read any reviews about this film on purpose as I didn't want to ruin any of the 'excitement' of the film. I naturally expected the film to be amazing, like the first film. Having now watched the film, I feel very disappointed. I didn't realise it was going to have loads of outbursts of singing in it! The singing (and there was A LOT of singing) came at really annoying points when you would much rather a storyline/charscters being developed instead. To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as usual but I was hoping that his character would develop more than it did. In fact, nothing much actually happened in the film and I started to feel quite bored in many parts, especially the singing bits. Towards the end I was willing the film to end just because nothing had really happened for over 2 hours apart from about 15 (boring) songs. By the time the end twist came I felt so bored that I didn't really care what happened and it didn't seem shocking or exciting. I was just glad to leave the cinema! What a shame for what had so much potential."
3.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux, captures the viewer. Musical moments are the best ones. The plot is a bit flat, but it comes alive in the second part of the film. Gaga's character is poorly developed, her scenes are the best. Gaga deserves best supporting actress. Foliè à deux deserves the win in the original song category. Even if I don't understand all this hatred towards musicals, in this film they are truly the best part, the sets and photography are wonderful. The lack of scenes in different locations causes a bit of repetition in the scenes, but in the final context it is reminiscent of old Hollywood in the singing scenes and for this reason alone it deserves a 10/10."
1.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,8 October 2024,"After watching this movie, I felt like I was hitted by a train.

What the hell, did just happened? Was I teletransported to a High School Musical (for grown ups), multiverse?

The whole movie, was boring.. I mean, after each scene with a dialogue, you had to endure a music.. i think it was like 15 songs, or something like that.

After watching the first Joker, this, burned my eyes. Why did they even do this?

It felt like, I was watching a Lady Gaga concert, and Joker was her side kick.

Joker's character, was ruined. The script, lead his actions into something, that the character of the first movie would never do, or act like.

The same goes for this ""Harley Quinn"" which acts nothing like the original Miss Quinn from the comics (or DC Universe). She does all the opposite things HQ would do.

This could be other character, but never a Harley Quinn.. more like a random crazy pseudo fan chick, who likes to sing.

After all that time enduring the musical moments (which I really want to fast forward with a control remote, but I couldn't because I was in a cinema), we still have to deal with an absurd ending.

Two facts: This movie was a huge Lady Gaga concert; The movie itself, meant to ruin Joker.

Regarding the performances, Joaquin Phoenix was great, he did the best he could, following this horrible script.

Regarding Gaga, she looked more like herself, after all, she is a singer.

And this is it.. if you are still curious, go watch this.

But don't tell me, you hadn't been warned!"
2.0,5 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a significant departure from the original ""Joker"" (2019), both in tone and execution, leaving some audiences disappointed. While the first ""Joker"" was celebrated for its gritty, realistic portrayal of mental illness and societal collapse, the sequel ventures into a musical direction that feels disjointed and lacks the same emotional depth. The shift to musical numbers with Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn disrupts the raw intensity that made the original so impactful, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the story.

The narrative is muddled, and it often feels like style is prioritized over substance. While Joaquin Phoenix still delivers a strong performance, the overall impact is less striking. The original Joker's chaotic descent into madness was grounded in a sense of grim reality, but the sequel's fantastical elements undermine that realism, making it difficult to take seriously.

Joker 2 tries to follow the success of its predecessor but unfortunately falls flat. The film is filled with unnecessary musical numbers that seem to exist solely to stretch the runtime to two hours, adding nothing of value to the story. What could have been a gripping narrative quickly turns into a dull courtroom drama that drags on without purpose, failing to maintain any real tension.

The plot itself is riddled with nonsensical moments, such as characters freely smoking and carrying lighters in prison-a glaring oversight that undermines any sense of realism. The decision to focus so heavily on the trial scenes makes the movie feel stagnant and monotonous.

Joaquin Phoenix, who once elevated the role of Joker to Oscar-winning heights, is unfortunately dragged down by this disaster of a sequel. It's disheartening to see such a talented actor stuck in a film that feels beneath him.

In the end, Joker 2 is a wasted opportunity-an uninspired mess that never should have been made. A misstep for Phoenix, and a major letdown for fans."

10.0,4 October 2024,"I feel betrayed-20 dollars gone, just like that. I could've bought a pizza and still had change for a bad B movie, which, by the way, would've been a better use of my time. This ""sequel"" feels like the filmmakers got together, realized they still had leftover snacks from the original movie's wrap party, and said, ""Hey, let's make something... anything."" And wow, did they deliver on the ""anything."" I mean, seriously, it's like they found the script at the bottom of a recycling bin, dusted it off, and said, ""Yep, this will do."" Congratulations to everyone involved; you successfully turned a much anticipated movie into pure cinematic dumpster diving with music on the background.

The highlight of my evening ended up being the popcorn, which had more flavor than the entire plot."
1.0,1 October 2024,"Coming up next: the movie we'll debate until the end of time about whether it even needed a sequel... Joker: Folie à Deux! But seriously, this sequel gave me way more Joker chaos than the original, with stunning visuals, killer cinematography, and campy moments that had me laughing like the Clown Prince of Crime himself. And let's not forget the phenomenal performances-Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga might just be on their way to another Oscar. Could I have done with fewer musical numbers? Absolutely. Could I have also lived without sitting next to someone who smelled like terrible? 100%. But, call me crazy-I actually prefer this over the OG. It's got The Last of Us Part II levels of controversy, but in a beautifully crafted way that, yeah, definitely won't be for everyone."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Went to see a movie that turned to indian 90s.

Wasted money, lack of adventure, seemed like the movie never began, completely delusing. This film promised an exciting story, but unfortunately, it fell completely flat. There was a severe lack of engaging moments, and the adventure that was hinted at never materialized. It felt like the movie was stuck in a perpetual setup phase, never quite getting to the main plot. The pacing was painfully slow, and the characters failed to connect in any meaningful way. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. Even if you have paid and are waiting to watch it, better dont bother to go, so your loss will be limited to money only, not money and time aswell."

9.0,5 October 2024,"I was totally upset and didn't expect such a low level of performance from this movie. Going in, I had higher hopes, but it fell flat in almost every aspect. The plot was hard to follow, with a weak storyline that seemed to go nowhere. The movie didn't give us much to hold on to, and I found myself wondering what exactly we were supposed to see or understand. It was confusing and felt like the narrative was scattered without a clear direction....

One of the most disappointing aspects was the casting. Specifically, Lady Gaga's role was completely miscast. Her performance lacked depth, and it seemed as though she was out of place. She didn't bring the complexity that was needed for the character, and I honestly believe Hollywood should reconsider casting her in major roles like this. It's frustrating to see such a weak portrayal in a film that could have had potential. Overall, the movie felt like a missed opportunity, and I wouldn't recommend it."
3.0,7 October 2024,"It would be interesting to know the backstory of how they decided to turn this sequel into a musical. Did they decide on that before they casted it and then they went and got Lady Gaga, or did they get Lady Gaga first and then say, ""well we have Lady Gaga, let's make it a musical!""

Either way it was a poor decision and not something anyone was expecting, asking for or, at least in the case of this viewer, wanting. Maybe that was the point, they were trying to do something different and unexpected, but unfortunately it just didn't work for me. It might have worked to some degree if it wasn't such a prominent part of the movie and if the rest of the movie had more to offer, but putting a legal procedural that did a lot of rehashing of the first movie around the musical fell flat and just didn't entertain.

Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are both talented actors and do the best they can with the spoken material. I'm guessing Lady Gaga had a hand in the musical numbers which, if it was what I came to see, would have been fine. As it was I left sad and disappointed for what could have been given how much I liked the first movie, and didn't like this one."
1.0,7 October 2024,"I don't understand why people hate this when this is a natural continuation of joker 1 by Todd Philips. I mean even the first one was more about the character study, the message, the artistic vision ...this one keeps on that track but with also a beautiful musical and legal confection. Performances are great, cinematography and score too and the ending for me was just PERFECT. Too many, especially Americans, are just too used to their idea of cinecomic and they get mad if you try something more ""festivaleque"" on their beloved comic characters. I am sure that if this was some smaller movie from Sundance no one would have reacted so bad

This movie is good, nihilistic, and beautifully shot and acted, and it will get praised over the years."

1.0,7 October 2024,"I'm not adverse to musicals. I love Sweeney Todd. But these musical numbers are terrible. Most of them are just solo renditions of Vegas showtunes from 70 years ago that you never hear any more because people got bored of them decades ago. AND . . River Phoenix can't sing a note, so listening to him spend 5 solid minutes hobbling his way through a solo rendition of a song that was stale 50 years ago is just torture. I get it, I see the irony- the Joker is playing a joke on us, the actual audience, torturing us from behind bars, across a movie screen. But the problem is, I don't have to sit there and endure it. I can simply get up and leave, which is what I did."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I rated Joker part 1 10/10 when it came out. I was excited and expecting so much for this film because the first one was amazing. Turns out it's just a lame, boring, 2 hour Lady Gaga music video. Phoenix is still good in terms of acting. Gaga is overwhelming and thrown me off the whole movie. It feels like she was forced down in our throats and made to showcase her for whatever reason. I saw other attendees rushing out of the cinema because of how bad this movie is. This might be even worse than Madame Web. This could be one of the worst CBM ever and worst movie of the year. This is terrible and I want."
9.0,5 October 2024,"Pros and cons of the movie:

a) Pros: Unfortunately, I haven't found any yet.

B) Cons:

Joker does nothing the entire movie, comes across as fragile, without impactful lines, without reflections or actions, doesn't even seem like the Joker from the first movie.


The musical is done in a terrible way, there's hardly any dialogue, just short, bad songs that make no sense to the plot.


-There is no story with a beginning, middle, and end.

The only action in the entire movie takes place in the Joker's imagination, which adds nothing to the film.



Finally, I suggest that you don't watch the movie, as you will be very disappointed with all these points I mentioned."

1.0,6 October 2024,"They made a mockery out of the joker. Seems like it was all revolving around lady gaga and her mediocre singing. The story went in circles and made no sense. Waste of time.

Why couldn't you make a standalone harley film that's a musical and not follow up a serious oscar winning movie with utter garbage. Lady Gaga should keep away from iconic characters and give it to actresses that can actually act.

She didn't strike me as unhinged or highly intelligent. Trust me this film is all over the place. I don't even think they knew what they were trying to make. Worse than Jared Letos Joker and that's saying something."
4.0,1 October 2024,"Boring, too long, pointless, and it's not Joker, it never was! It's a random story of a madman turned killer, ignored by society who was named Joker for the simple purpose of making easy money off the gullible people who fell for it!

Yes, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor and he plays a madman convincingly here just as he did in the first part, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Plus, his constant grimacing, contorting his face and body, his silly dancing in the streets and on the stairs, or wherever, his talk of loneliness and pain, using high school level language and logic, it's absolutely pathetic!!

And the first part of this story was exactly the same, so full of this childish, cliche, pseudo philosophy, that uses such groundbreaking slogans as screw the rich, screw the politicians, the right wing bad, and the left wing bad too - wow, so profound! Sarcasm.

Sorry, Todd Phillips, but the second part of your Joker story, just like the first one, is a hollow, primitive waste of time, the second part is even worse because, on top of that, it's a failed musical!

In short, anyone who ever said that these movies have any value as a piece of great cinema or on any philosophical level, has the mentality of a child.

It's a chaotic, immature, pretentious mess, just like part one! The fact that so many people loved the first part is depressing, for that very reason! I hope people won't be fooled as much now, by the second round of this pathetic, shameless money grab!"
3.0,4 October 2024,"Joker 2 was not at all what I expected, and honestly, it had absolutely no reason to exist. The idea of Joker as a character has so much potential, and I was exited for all the interesting ways in which the story could have gone, but this simply didn't. Yes, it's musical, and while the musical numbers added little to nothing, yet I had absolutely no problem with them. The acting? Impeccable by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga-no complaints on that level. However, the story itself? What a disappointment.

As you watch, you get this feeling that nothing's really happening. That realization burrows in slow, and by the end, you're just sitting there thinking, ""That's it? Really?"" It just seemed to go nowhere, especially where the character of Arthur/Joker was concerned. It is gorgeously shot and looks amazing; the movie, from a cinematic point of view, is stunning. The ambiance and atmosphere hit all the right notes. But with all that said and done, it doesn't do anything.

You just keep waiting for the story to take flight or do something major, and instead, it introduces Harley Quinn then. Nothing. It really feels like it's digging itself into a hole instead of going anywhere meaningful. I think they should have taken the story in a whole other direction or did more with it.

So for now, this feels like the end of this Elseworlds story, and truthfully, that is probably for the best."
10.0,3 October 2024,"Really disappointed with the sequel, it turned out to be a cringe worthy musical, and lacked the darkness and depth that the first film had. Film is set with Arthur in prison and waiting trial, when he meets Harlequin. They fall in love, and so much promise to the story that could have been. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga delivered their usual quality performances, but the film was ruined when they kept bursting into song! I don't want to be a spoiler either, but the ending was also a shocker; really didn't expect that, it just didn't hold true to the Joker story, so no more sequels,, which is a relief I suppose, small mercies."
1.0,7 October 2024,"Knock knock!!! The point of this movie is not the story... It is made of beautiful pictures, outstanding performance and musical.

The super villain is not the hero. The super villain is a phantasm made by the audience. Arthur Flex is the important character, the victim of a cruel society. Another outstanding performance from Phoenix who can sing and act equally. Gaga also offers a nice supporting act.

The director was able to keep the good stuff from Joker and create an interesting musical that offers an emotionally disturbing time... Not recommended for the faint hearted. No point to watch it if you dislike musical."
1.0,3 October 2024,"Film is too long and most of the film is boring.

It has some good scenes but story is so bad I think I could write a better sequel. Cinematography is very beautiful and joaquin performance is very good. I don't know who comes up with idea that thriller and musical can fit well with each other. It seemed like the whole movie was made so Gaga can sing. The singing is obviously good but in many scenes unnecessary. The pace is really slow and it feels like it's never going to end. At first i thought it's not the same director but tod phillips disappointed me. First time i walk out of the cinema.

It is normal for an idea to go wrong. And this is ine of these , deadirector you don't say to us audience what you think a villain is for us. We already had seen it with joker 1.

God knows ntill when we will be seeing a joker movie. Cause this one.. it is not.

When I saw that Gaga was going to play in the movie, I thought she was going to do a song or two, but not a fricking musical..i cannot beleave this happened. L3ny.blue."
1.0,8 October 2024,"The first movie was an interesting exploration into the Joker character. They spent a lot of time going over the causes of his trauma, his obsession with being on a late night talk show, and finally the outburst that would display his true madness. Chain-smoking aside, it was a good movie.

THIS MOVIE, however, fell flat for me. As I noticed in the first movie, although I sort of enjoyed it, it seems the writers and actors had no prior knowledge of the characters. Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist whose sessions with Joker began to crack her sanity until she developed an obsessive love for him. In this movie, she's a patient with a Joker obsession, completely negating the nuance of their relathionship. It would've been far more interesting to see the original verion, interviewing Joker, beginning to empathize with him, and then develop an obsession; something more gradual rather than forced.

While they introduced some interesting concepts like Harvey Dent and the movie's ending, I didn't enjoy the overall product."
3.0,6 October 2024,This movie is a Gaga concert where she sings some not particularly good or catchy songs with the only take away being that Gaga likes to sing so much that she will sing anything anywhere and not even The Joker can make her stop... He literally asked her to stop singing towards the end of the movie and she completely ignored him and kept going much to my horror because close to the half way point I was begging for the musical to stop and the real Joker movie to begin. 2+ hours later still no real movie to be seen. I literally think watching paint dry would be more interesting... I completely regret paying to see this movie at the cinema!
9.0,6 October 2024,"I absolutely loved the first film.

I waited a long time for the second one and the expectations were high.

I went to see it today October 2, 2024 at the cinema as soon as it came out.

Disappointment and disorientation are inevitable, given the screenplay which doesn't really give anything important to the continuation of the story.

I wonder what the meaning of all this is. Sequels must have meaning and utility otherwise they are useless and remain just a marketing operation driven by a misleading and very clever trailer.

During the film we are constantly waiting for the twists that will turn the story around. When these seem to arrive, in reality they remain half-finished or only sadden. In the end there will be no exciting twist and the story doesn't mesh or convince at all.

Lady Gaga's character is useless and unclear personally, like so many other things in the film.

The only very positive note and I underline the only one: another masterful performance by the great Joaquin Phoenix who deserves a second Oscar."

2.0,2 October 2024,"Up till the end of the second act, I thought the movie was phenomenal! The cimeatohraphy was great, the acting was great, the music was great, the musical parts where interesting and where eluding to something. Although I did feel like the pacing was really slow untill this point, even compared to the Joker (2019). And then.. it was over. What I thought was the end of act 2 was actually the end of the movie, leaving me incredibely dissapointed. The entire movie was essentially just building up to a recap of the best moments from the first film, and that's it. This is not a movie that works on it's own, nor does it work as a sequel. Joker: Folie a Deux is an extended epilogue to the first, and the common interpretation of the ending would attempt to soil the first movie.

This is probably the worst well-made movie I have ever seen, period."

1.0,8 October 2024,"Oh now hollywood preps the movies based on who is playing. Lady gaga is here, so fans want to listen to music, let's make it a musical, screw up the script. No one cares. People are delusional to create a logic out of this by saying this is done to deter Joker from public due to first movie. What are you talking about, this movie is crap and that is it. Trying to create a nonsense logic out of it is truly a producer's work (and effort of paid soldiers) that are trying to save the movie. You failed the movie, script, acting, everything, no one will watch your joker 3 anymore, I hope you learn from mistakes and get out of covid phase of laziness."
8.0,4 October 2024,"Is not bad because of the acting or the storyline of the movie... It's all about the directing and the creative decisions that were made.

First the good about the movie: The acting. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga were spectacular in their roles. So was Harry Lawtey as Dent and all other secondary actors.

The general mood and feeling of the movie was also great, similar to the first one ins some aspects.

Now the bad: The decision of making the movie a musical, rhythm of the movie, character development and the ending.

It felt like every time something interesting was about to happen it got ruined by the need to make every important scene a musical. And although the songs were great, it really took away from the tension of the movie. And, when the scene was finally over, of that interesting stuff that was building up suddenly disappeared.

And the ending, underwhelming the say the least. There were so many possible outcomes and it seemed like they choose the worst possible one.

Also, there was basically 0 character development. They could have done so much more with what they had to work with...

Anyways... This movie is not what you would expect after the first one."
4.0,4 October 2024,
5.0,5 September 2024,"In the new ""Joker"" movie, Lady Gaga plays Harley Quinn, a significant role alongside Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. Her performance adds an intriguing dynamic to the story, as she brings a mix of vulnerability, chaos, and charm to the character. Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is different from past versions-she's more grounded, but still has that edge that makes her unpredictable and compelling.

The movie also leans into musical elements, making it stand out from the first film. There are a few surreal, almost dreamlike musical sequences where Joker and Harley share the screen, blending their twisted love story with these moments of song and dance. This gives the film a unique feel, turning it into something more like a dark musical. The songs don't take away from the movie's serious tone but instead add layers to the characters' emotions and inner turmoil.

Overall, Lady Gaga's presence and the musical moments add a fresh twist to the Joker's world, giving it a mix of romance, madness, and theatrical flair. This approach might surprise some viewers, but it works well within the story's darker themes."
3.0,2 October 2024,"It's the most anticipated and the most boring movie of the century, I am so sad to watch this one, I wish I hadn't watched it only so that the impression from Joker 1 had stayed in mind, but seriously, what have you done to the character of Joker.

You literally made a joke movie and the movie had no storyline, no thrill no entertainment at all, I had to force my self to sit and watch and then to top it all, you get a song every other minute??? I mean why did you have to make it musical at all?????? This was literally not required at all, the songs made it sooooooo boring, most of the people walked out of the theatre after the first 40-50 mins

You literally spoiled our childhood I swear, the type of character of Joker we had in our mind and then Heath Ledger, taking the character to the ultimate level, and now in Joker 2, it is all gone, it's not even square one, it's the worst thing ever, please change the storywriter and the director for the sake of our emotions.

The point is when ur so upset with the movie, you don't even value the efforts of the actors, sorry to say, Joaquin Phoenix wasted his talent on this one totally."
3.0,7 October 2024,"The majority of the original Jokers demographics were 62% men ages 18-34. Why in the world would they make a musical with this type of audience? From my understanding most men don't watch or enjoy musicals. I would recommend just streaming this if you really want to watch it, it's not worth the money on gas and tickets just to walk out.

The first movie had something unique and interesting to it. This movie literally has none of that. If you enjoy ASMR videos then you may actually enjoy this movie as it does a very good job of making you want to fall asleep with how boring it is. All I have to say is don't watch."
3.0,3 October 2024,"PLEASE DONT WHAT THIS MOVIE. The worst movies ever. The biggest fails of movie history. Most of them should not be seen by anyone, unless, of course, they are in the mood for a bad film! Most of them are just a waste of time, failed effort, while others are judged extra harshly due to their promising material. It might seem ungrateful to be negative , but making it really does not say that I did not appreciate that the projects were made.. I do not understand who sees these films. They are not funny, not good, not even entertaining.this movie is a crime . It's horrible please please don't whatch this movie."
10.0,6 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a direct sequel to the first film, aiming to recapture the unique atmosphere that made its predecessor so successful. The story continues to follow Arthur Fleck, now fully immersed in his Joker persona, as he navigates deeper psychological challenges and relationships, particularly with Harley Quinn. However, while the first film masterfully balanced psychological drama, suspense, and societal critique, this sequel feels somewhat more indulgent in style and lacks the same raw emotional impact.

One of the standout aspects of the film is its visual and musical elements. The cinematography is striking, and the soundtrack once again plays a key role in setting the eerie, unsettling tone. The performances, especially from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, are committed and intense, elevating the film's character-driven moments. However, the storyline at times meanders and leans into more theatrical territory, making it feel less grounded and more abstract than the original.

While the actors deliver impressive performances, the development of Arthur and Harley's relationship feels rushed in parts, and the film doesn't delve as deeply into their psychological complexities as it could. The addition of musical numbers, while bold, might not sit well with everyone and at times disrupts the film's dark, gritty atmosphere."
1.0,7 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to its predecessor's legacy. The decision to pivot to a musical format, while ambitious, feels jarring and mismatched with the original's dark and gritty tone. This shift undermines the tension and atmosphere that made the first film resonate with audiences. Additionally, the story spends too much time on Arthur Fleck's introspective struggles, resulting in a slow pace that lacks the dynamic energy of the original. Despite strong performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the film struggles to find its footing, ultimately leaving fans wanting more."
4.0,3 October 2024,"I went in without looking at many reviews and I'm glad I did because this movie was incredible, the musical aspect might turn some people off but it definitely works for the movie and they explain it at the beginning.

The acting is phenomenal, particularly Lady Gaga who is so deeply rooted in this role and you can tell she was meant to play 'Lee'. The cinematography is insane and I love how a lot of it is up for interpretation, they are always the best movies in my opinion. The ending will divide people but I loved it.

Joquien and Gaga understand nuance and it's very evident in their performances."
5.0,3 October 2024,"Joker: Folie a Deux follows up 2019's The Joker, both directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix. Where Joker actually had something to say about mental health, health care and the staggering income inequality brought on by possible extreme right wing governance, Joker 2 has nothing to say, about anything.

The sequel picks up a couple of years after the events of the first movie, and Arthur Fleck is now imprisoned in Arkham, awaiting trial. While detained he meets ""Leigh"" (Lady Gaga). The second half of the movie then turns into sort of a courtroom proceeding. (No spoilers as ALL of this information is in the marketing and trailers).

There is really nothing interesting happening in this movie at all, save for maybe one scene.

Also, I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA where, how or why they spent 200,000,000$ on this movie.

As a moderate fan of the first movie, this one just did not do anything for me. The Lady Gaga musical elements are well performed of course though they add nothing to the movie whatsoever.

This is a disappointment."
4.0,7 October 2024,
4.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie A Deux (2024) : Movie Review -

After the blockbuster success of Joker (2019), Todd Phillips is back with a direct sequel, ""Joker: Folie A Deux."" This time, the joker is not alone. Arthur Fleck is not alone anymore. He has found someone to love, and he doesn't want to die. Lee, aka Harley Quinn, completes him; she ""gets"" him. ""She's really something,"" says Arthur, and why not because she's the only one who understands him, saying, ""He is not sick. He is perfect. Together, we are gonna build a mountain from a little hill."" Now back to Joker's climax and its psychologically disturbing characteristics, I asked myself, ""Did such a dark and intense story deserve a follow-up like this, I mean, the one filled with love, courtroom drama, and musicals?"" My heart said, ""Maybe yes,"" but my brain said, ""Maybe No!""

The film begins with mentally disturbed and nihilist Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in jail, with his inner bones clearly showing up touching his external skin. This jail life was worse than the world outside-maybe that's what they wanted to portray from Arthur's point of view. He sees Lee (Lady Gaga) in a music room, and they create an instant attraction towards each other. Meanwhile, Fleck is going through medication and counseling, and his lawyer, Ms. Stewart (Catherine Keener), is trying to prove that he suffered through split personality disorder at the night of the crime. Lee is freed, and she goes on to give interviews about Fleck being a ""perfect"" guy to live in society, and then the trial begins with Harvey Dent (Harry Lawtey) fighting the case as an assistant district attorney. Will Arthur win the case? That's what the film is all about in the second half.

Frankly, I believe, the story of The Joker should have never become a love story or a courtroom drama, and here it becomes both. That wasn't sensible at all. Yes, it doesn't make sense to see a criminal who killed a person on a live show and five other people, trying to prove that it wasn't him after all. Even a medical term like personality disorder can't be an excuse in this case, as it was in Anniyan (2005). Moreover, seeing a morally disturbed and criminally advanced Joker as a puppet and a silent bully of the class doesn't do justice to the image people have in mind. In the pre-climax scene, Joker sees a complete shift in his own mindset just after a sexual abuse by the guard. Similarly, Quinn's obsession for the Joker, having a baby, and then abandoning him all happen so fast that you don't see them as concrete reasons to carry the story. In short, it's a ""love got him down"" kind of scenario, which has been in Hollywood since the 1930s in many gangster dramas, but instead of a femme fatale touch, Joker 2 is driven by guilty consciousness, dark blue nihilism, and personality conflicts. I still don't understand, ""Why would Arthur even kiss his lawyer twice?"" Most of the musical numbers and crazy scenes I imagined from the trailer, turned out to be dream sequences, and a few were not there at all. Too much disappointment to Kitty!

Performance-wise, it was a good show. Joaquin Phoenix stunned us all with his act in Joker, and he did it again in Joker 2. It's just that the character has no graph and no soul this time, so it feels dry. The blood, the liquidated feel of that anger-everything was missing. Lady Gaga surprises as Harley Quinn-not very much to what we expected from the promos. She was looking promising from the pre-release movie clips already, and she delivers. A no-sorry female antagonist who doesn't even care about her boyfriend who has finally turned yellow-oh yes, we don't see such ladies in our movies often. Brendan Gleeson is that brutal guard in the jail, and be is awesome. Catherine Keener as a lawyer, Zazie Beetz as Sophie (a cameo), and Harry Lawtey as Dent, all have done fine in those small roles. Steve Coogan and dwarfy Leigh Gill add good support.

Why would anyone want to make a Joker's sequel a musical? I don't understand. Joker: Folie A Deux's musical numbers didn't entertain me much the way that one scene from ""The Band Wagon"" (1953) did. Gaga singing the same lines or any other song would get my thumbs up any other day, but not today. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher was impressive. That smile with lipstick on a mirror and the top view of the four different color umbrellas taking Arthur in jail or all those dreaming musical sequences-Sher has done brilliant camerawork. Joker was conceived as a standalone film, and Joker 2 literally ends the saga-too quickly! The screenplay is boring and slow, which makes you feel sleepy (believe me, I felt so). The production design was fine, and the sound was well mixed, but nothing noticeable. I can't even imagine that Todd Phillips directed a ""banger"" like ""Joker,"" and now he is the same person who directed a ""blunder"" like ""Joker: Folie à Deux."" It's just not acceptable. He hasn't just disappointed the fans with this sequel but also destroyed the image of Joker created by Phoenix and himself only. Can't believe how someone can really make a boring and meaningless sequel like this to a modern classic like ""Joker"" (2019). I wish it wasn't ""true,"" and I could forget it as a ""fantasy.""

RATING - 4/10*"
9.0,6 October 2024,"I am 57 years old and I have seen hundreds of films in my life. I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst film I have ever seen. It is a piece of utter crap. Something that is an open insult to an audience that has paid good money to waste two hours of their lives. There is absolutely nothing in this film, it's a vacuous, empty and meaningless waste of time. The first film was a tragic masterpiece that was in a strange sort of way actually quite moving. You could at least feel a grain of sympathy for someone who had been abused all his life and finally cracked in a burst of insane violence. But this film lacked any kind of storyline and the Lady Gaga character was not even explained properly, she just appeared out of nowhere, a complete nonentity with no purpose. The Joker himself appeared resigned, sullen and uninteresting - completely different from the original film. The ending and the Joker's fate was not surprising, but again, it was sudden and unexplained, no real motive behind it. This piece of crap is absolutely shameful, and I hope this director is not given any more opportunities to produce junk such as this."
3.0,1 October 2024,"Everything in this movie felt very intentional. The first movie was dark and unsettling in a new way so why expect the second to be a carbon copy? It was weird, different, upsetting, and uncomfortable. That's why i love the joker and now the second. Parts didn't go how i wanted it to and in a way that was better. People get too upset about it being musically leaning and not burning down the world but isn't the point to be uncomfortable? Hard to live up to the first hence an 8 not a 9 but the performances by everyone was amazing and very beautiful movie to watch. Go in expecting to be disappointed and you'll enjoy it."
5.0,9 October 2024,"Was really looking foward to this movie .

Was a bit disappointed after watching Joker this was like a musical and theatre performance and felt more like a lady gaga plot .

I would say that I think the way they used some of the music is good in some ways as you kinda get the weird strange of the mind and how it works.

It was also sad in some parts as it's like no one ever loved him for who he was other than love him as the joker .

I wouldn't really rate it some of it I liked but often it drifted into other parts and I was like what's happening.

I liked some of the dancing and some of the laughs was cryptic and mind wierd gamss ."
5.0,6 October 2024,"What you've heard is true. Joker: Folie à Deux is not good. But my reasons for not liking it, I think, are different from why most people don't like it. Let me be clear, I don't fault this movie for trying something new. I don't fault it for taking big risks. I don't fault it for directly challenging what made the first film so iconic. What frustrates me is how half-baked and half-assed everything is. For a film with such daring ideas, Todd Phillips clearly doesn't have the courage of his convictions to follow through with any of them. The passion that should drive this film is missing entirely. Lazy is the best word to describe it.

Arthur Fleck is in Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial. He's beaten and run ragged by a thuggish gang of prison guards. One day, he meets Harley Quinn during a session of ""musical therapy"" and Harley falls madly in love with him. As it turns out, she's attracted to the dangerous celebrity he's become. Think of the psychotic love notes that real-life serial killers get in prison, and you have what this film is sort of touching upon. Since they both love to sing, they sing... and they sing... and they never stop singing. Yes, it's a musical. A big jukebox musical, complete with choreographed dance numbers.

I reiterate, I'm not against the concept of making this a musical. But it's how they go about it here that's so disingenuous and cynical. If Arthur and Harley sang only to themselves, with no orchestra backing them up, it would've been akin to the behavior of real-life psychopaths. Think of the Charles Manson prison interviews from the 1980s. But instead, it's nothing more than an excuse to hear Lady Gaga belt out a few show tunes for the soundtrack.

Lady Gaga is a fine actress, and an even finer singer, but Todd Phillips creates a version of Harley Quinn that gives her absolutely nothing to work with. She does not match Arthur's mental illness in any way. She isn't convincing as a person who would realistically be locked away in an asylum. You genuinely feel how cheaply she's used to sell tickets here.

We're slogging along with this film for the greater part of two hours. But then, there's the last 20 minutes. This, in my view, is where the greatest concepts and risks of the film are realized. The first Joker movie thrived as a spectacle that held a mirror to a decimated American society, obsessed with lone-wolf killers and their pathetic, selfish reasons for committing their atrocious crimes. This film wants to take that and smash it into a thousand pieces. Todd Phillips may be telling us that he never wanted Joker to be such a controversial film in the first place. I get the sense that not only is he unhappy to have made a sequel, but he's pissed at how most of us interpreted it. Maybe it's because I had lost so much patience by the film's end, but I found the shocking conclusion to be cathartic and rewarding. As a microcosm of how we should view these horrible people as a society, it's even more satisfying.

I realize that everyone's take on this film will be vastly different. That's a great thing. Even bad films should get people talking. It's a shame that that bad film is a sequel to Joker."
2.0,3 October 2024,"What turned out after 5 years is a boring musical. Who wrote the storyline? The ending fails most audience's expectation and it is so contradicting with the previous 90 minutes. Though Joaquin's performance is a continuation of the first episode, there's too many sing-and-dance fantasies added which spoiled his in-depth emotional expressions. Gaga actually not fits for Harley Quinn's character. It should be a good chance to tell how and why Harley is attracted by Joker's mind and charisma. But unfortunately, there is zero about that for the whole film. In sum, this episode is very disappointed."

5.0,1 October 2024,A perfect flip side to the first film Joker folie a deux challenges and deconstructs everything about the first film and how it was received and injects it with bold new decisions that pay off in surprising ways. Most shocking of all is the films commitment to taking a moral high road and challenging Arthur and the audience's ideas of entertainment and justice. The musical direction brings out the ever present score of the first film and creates a new language for Arthur and Lee to communicate. This film is the ultimate rebuttal to those that loved the first film and those that hated it and I loved every second of it.

Oftentimes when I see a review, or reviews, of movies before I go see them and they're on the negative side. I try and push them aside. I hope I'll see something the reviewer didn't see and have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that is not the case for ""Folie á Deux"".

My concluding thoughts on the film were, ""man what a waste."" The first ""Joker"" film is amazing. It's fun, exciting, and you have someone to root for. This movie is utterly boring and useless. It's not funny. It's depressing and not memorable. It lacks actual character, and I feel like it gives me no one to root for.

While some could argue that the soundtrack is good, I personally think it's a distraction. Every time a musical number comes up, just as I was beginning to enjoy a sequence, I felt like the winds in the sail were blown out because it takes away from the pacing of the film. I personally think the musical numbers should've been worked in with something happening on screen pertinent to the movie.

I'm indifferent to Joaquin Phoenix in this one. He definitely sold the depressing aspect of the film, but scenes where there should've been energy, he definitely lacked. Lady Gaga feels like she's just trying to salvage her career. I don't know if she's still producing music, but there was a lacklustre performance from her. She's also the only reason I believe this film was a musical. If she's not in it then I think it would've been a normal film.

Overall, it's a long two hours of nothingness. The ending is atrocious and the beginning is forgettable. The middle is dredged by an ebb and flow of enjoyable film interspersed with terribly paced musicals. Also, it was difficult to understand the spoken word at times in general. Mix that with a musical and sometimes I was hoping I didn't miss anything important. If I knew then what I now, I would've definitely waited for the film to hit a digital stream. For me it's not even worth going on a cheap night, nor if someone was willing to pay for my ticket to go just to keep them company. But I can't keep you from going so the choice is always yours....

That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!"
4.0,11 October 2024,"In 2019, a film called ""Joker"" was released.

It was a visceral story set in the 1970's about a mentally disturbed man called Arthur Fleck (played by Joaquin Phoenix). It was filmed with a budget of about $50m USD which is small change in Hollywood.

The movie was confronting, violent and disturbing at times. I loved it. I think you could say actually I was a super fan of Joker.

I wasn't the only one. Joker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 4. The film was a box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, becoming the first R-rated film to do so, and it was the highest-grossing R-rated film until being surpassed by Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024.

It was also the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019. The film received numerous accolades, including two Academy Award wins at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score out of 11 nominations including Best Picture, becoming the first DC film to do so.

I have been waiting 5 long years to see the sequel. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" aka ""Joker 2"", was released on October 4, 2024.

Joker 2 again features Joaquin Phoenix as Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn - Joker's love interest.

The reviews have been appalling and after watching it tonight I know why.

Joker could have been a multi-billion dollar franchise with 6 or 7 movies. But not anymore.

For reasons I cannot explain, Warner Brothers decided to make it a musical. In 135 minutes there is about 30 minutes of musical action, almost none of which adds any value or enjoyment to the movie. It would be a far better movie if you just erased all the musical scenes.

There was potential to make this second movie great, it would have been easy. But instead they've literally blown up the whole franchise.

I have walked out of the cinema bewildered. It's like they were dealt a royal flush in poker, and folded without even waiting to see what the other players called....

What a massive disappointment.

Erase the musical sections and change the ending, and you could easily have another billion dollar hit on your hands..."
10.0,4 October 2024,"Compare of what was the first film this is a complete disappointment. I was such in hype for this film but obviously is wrong doing expectations, however I didn't expected this to be bad. Basically no conversation between Joker and Harley, she was always singing every time there was an interaction. We basically know nothing about Harley, apart from some information of her family and stuff like that. Also how they get together felt so unrealistic. I liked the part where Joker have his shows in his imagination, basically representing his feelings, but apart from that everything was really bad. Disappointed."
3.0,4 October 2024,"Joker 2 intro is pure Warner Bros and will come as a surprise to many . Establishes the fact that half the movie is in Jokers head . His Fantasy's are a Romantic musical. His reality is brutal . Arkham jail is Alcatraz at its worst . The Musical numbers are unorthodox but are classy numbers . Joaquin Phoenix digs even deeper this time and his performance is Masterful. Dark Humor and moments of hilarity. Lady Gaga gives us Harley Quinn we haven't Seen before . Sad, manipulative and Sexy . The score is haunting again . A couple appearances from characters from the first Joker film . Giving there side Arthur Fleck . Joker 2 is a Tragedy of a tale. What can u expect from Arkham Asylum ."
3.0,14 October 2024,The story was so terrible. It didn't focus on what happened after Arthur aka joker caused so much damage to Gotham City. It should have focused on Arthur talking to Thomas Wayne thinking he's his own father which should have helped. But instead it showed joker in Arkham Asylum with Harley Quinn . This new Harley was not a good character. Lady Gaga did ok . But I felt like why make joker a musical . That is not a good script . I think this movie was not very well written. I wish Todd could've made it better by getting joker in the wrong crowd and goes into a factory and falls in acid and becomes joker . But in this movie it's a musical and court justice movie. I feel like this film will not win an Oscar next year . Absolutely no.

3.0,3 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux hardly tries to be cohesive in its Story, but then ironically interferes the story with long Musical sequences without giving them context or combining them into the plot.

Funny how The Joker has nothing to do with the films story, it is about the actions of the Joker that happened prior. Joker is a passive character and we learn nothing new about him, the development he has is that he realizes he doesn't want to be the Joker anymore, which does not a single bit represent the character we've seen in the last film. It rather represents a commentary about the critics and audiences that looked at Joker from a morally questionable standpoint. And of course, Joker can't do what Joker does anymore because that would hurt the Image of the Filmmaker. Or should I say the Studio?

The point is that this film plays it safe. Joker doesn't blow up things, he doesn't play games, he isn't on the verge of becoming Gothams biggest threat, he isn't the Joker. He's just Arthur. And I am watching this film to experience the embracement of The Joker that Arthur develops throughout the story, which unfortunately doesn't happen...

Joaquin Phoenix does his best but it isn't enough to make this Character fully fleshed out. Even Lady Gaga, which has no depth to her character, doesn't serve the story a single bit. There is nothing they discover about each other, there is no room for development in these two. They have no chemistry together because Harley being in Arthur's Life doesn't change anything about his character. The same goes for her.

The courtroom scenes have their moments, but all these moments do is referencing the first movie.

I can understand that these musical scenes should give us a glimpse of Joker's mind, but there is nothing f-d up about these sequences beside a few things. The mind of the Joker is way more disturbing than dancing and singing happily.

And yes, The Filmmaking and the score is great in every single scene, but it does not help when the picture releases no emotions inside of you.

Yes, it is logical for Arthur to defend himself in court. Yes it's a more realistic take on the relationship of Harley and Joker. But depth is not existing. Realism without Depth and meaning means nothing.

That said, I would rather have an illogical story that is thematically strong, than an story that makes sense but is thematically shallow."
1.0,3 October 2024,"This movie to me was a deception. Where's the story? The entire movie run slowly, the relantionship between joker and harley queen happen fast and not created a relation with the who watch. The plot is very weak. A singer joker? Omg. I really don't like musical movies, but this is very boring. In the final chapter, when you look and think ""wow, now will be insane, like should be!"" and not, Again, nothing happen. Every I wanted was leave that movie theater and go home forget every minute that my eyes saw. The only positive point was Joaquin Phoenix's interpretation. You go to home with the feeling that a lot missing."
10.0,12 October 2024,"I meant to review this a few days ago and I've mamy things to say about it. First off its not as bad as people have been saying and a lot of their criticisms are quite stupid. The musical aspect was a brilliant idea in theory. The plot was brilliant in theory. Lady Gaga and joaquin pheonix were brilliant with what they had. The seeds for brilliance were without a doubt present but this movie just fell to poor execution.

A good idea isn't enough to make a movie good. The musical aspect of this film kind of represents the movie as a whole because it was half assed. It was to ashamed to be a musical that it didn't work well as one. The writing dropped dramatically in quality from the first one. The characters mainly brendan gleeson and lady Gaga were horribly underutilised which was a real shame. The idea for the ending, for the most part was a great idea and was a great direction fir the movie to go in but it was executed awfully. Joker dying was stupid. An awful idea. But his renouncing of joker wasn't completely. But it made no sense in context of the rest of the movie. The movie thinks its smarter than it is. Really its a just a good idea put poorly to paper. I admire what it tried to do but i dont appreciate what it did. 5/10."

-The story is slow and full of musicals that do not fit the style of the film.

-Lady Gaga is a great singer and dancer, let her stay that way and never again play movies that aren't about music.

-The 70s songs were ok , but i loved the OG soundtrack that gets you in character rather than try to make you sing-along.

-What was the point of Harvey Dent ? A random lawyer would of been the same with less hype and let down

-Smoking ALL THE TIME . As a cinematic resource i get it , it adds visuals and its helps character development . But it was heavily overused and it didnt let to anything .

-The way they broke joker ... Yes that could break anyone BUT joker ,cause joker its already broken .

+Joaquin Phoenix was Amazing as always , the only thing that keeps you from leaving early

+Visuals are great

+The cartoons at the begining were great. Maybe if it was an hour of cartoons with arthurs personalities fighting insead of musicals it would be more fitting.

+I liked the trial , a bit weird for this type of character and could of been a bigger deal but i liked it . Nice touch having people from the first film

Maybe they didn't want people to sympathize with villains."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over and kept checking the time. Why on earth would you make this a musical? It drags so so so much, nothing really happens except for the rinse and repeat nature and endless singing. You keep hook ga be thinking the old gritty nature of the first film will come out soon but just when you think it will, a song pops in and takes away the true essence of what and how we knew original Joker. I was really trying so hard to find out or understand what exactly is the story. And I did keep looking up the time. Several people in my local cinema left half way though and I kept wondering if I should have as well. The 2.5 hours I will never get back 😒"
3.0,4 October 2024,"In order to properly review the Joker sequel, I'm going to briefly describe everything the movie is NOT, rather than what it is, because there's much more to discuss there.

It's not funny. They don't try to make us laugh even once, not genuinely. The tone is unrelentingly grim.

It's not clever. The jukebox musical numbers are inserted carelessly and add absolutely nothing to the plot, which in itself is practically non-existent.

It's not well-staged. There isn't a single memorable set piece in the entire godawful production. It's actually quite gawdy and awkward.

It's not interesting. The ""plot,"" such as it is, rambles and stagnates and stutters from point to point without any sense of purpose or direction.

It's not well-acted. Lady GaGa is completely wasted, both as an actress and a singer. Joaquin Phoenix is wasted too, as he barely even spends any time as his Joker alter-ego, and his time as Arthur Fleck is dreadfully dull.

It's frankly painful to sit through.

Whether or not that was the point of making it, I truly don't care. It has zero redeeming qualities.

It should be played over and over again to violent criminals in institutions as a method of torture."
10.0,8 October 2024,"It was expected that the sequel to ""Joker"" would struggle to reach the same depth and impact as the first film. The 2019 original, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, made waves with its dark, psychological tone, offering a unique take on the villain's origin story. However, in ""Joker: Folie à Deux,"" Phillips seems to have lost his way, delivering a sequel that, while it has some interesting elements, feels disconnected and, at times, soulless.

The first thing that stands out is the change in tone. While ""Joker"" explored an oppressive and decaying Gotham through a raw, almost realistic lens, ""Folie à Deux"" mixes elements of musical, courtroom drama, and a touch of fantasy, creating a film that seems undecided about what it wants to be. The inclusion of musical numbers-a bold and, in theory, promising idea-ends up being one of the film's biggest missteps. Instead of organically blending into the narrative, the songs feel like jarring interruptions, flashy distractions that don't really advance the plot or deepen the characters.

The relationship between Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) and Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga)-the future Harley Quinn-is one of the central aspects of the story. However, this dynamic, which could have been fascinating and layered, ends up being shallow and predictable. Gaga, who's already proven her talent in films like ""A Star Is Born,"" seems limited by a script that doesn't give her much room to shine. Gaga's Harley is less vibrant and eccentric than the version popularized by Margot Robbie, which could have been an interesting approach if the film knew what to do with this more restrained take. Unfortunately, her character ends up as a shadow of the anti-heroine we know, defined more by her obsession with Arthur than by her own motivations.

As for Joaquin Phoenix, always intense and committed to his roles, he tries to bring depth to a character who, in this sequel, feels lost. Arthur is more beaten down, more disillusioned, and the film tries to convey this visually with a gray, oppressive cinematography. The problem is that, no matter how much Phoenix tries, the script doesn't give him much to work with. The lack of clarity about Arthur's intentions and emotional journey makes it hard for the audience to connect with him in a meaningful way. In ""Joker,"" Arthur's arc was clear: a broken man, marginalized by society, slowly descending into madness. Here, that trajectory is muddled, without direction.

The biggest problem with ""Folie à Deux,"" however, is the sense that everything is happening out of obligation. The film feels like it was made more out of pressure to continue a successful franchise than out of a genuine creative need. There's a noticeable frustration in how the ideas are executed-it's as if Phillips is trying to make a subversive film but doesn't fully believe in his own choices. The visual and narrative references, which in the first film evoked Scorsese and 70s cinema, here turn into hollow pastiches, lacking the same impact or purpose.

And it doesn't help that the film's pacing is sluggish. The long trial of Arthur, which should have been the emotional and narrative core of the plot, ends up being tedious and repetitive. There are moments where it feels like we're stuck in an endless loop of courtroom scenes that go nowhere, while the potential to explore Arthur's mental state-and how it influences his perception of reality-is only superficially touched upon.

In the end, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is more of a missed opportunity than a true continuation. The film tries to be many things at once-musical, psychological drama, social commentary-but doesn't succeed in any of them. The lingering feeling is of a director unsure of what he wants to say or where he wants to take his characters, delivering a film that, despite strong performances and competent production design, ends up being frustrating and disappointing. If the first ""Joker"" was like a love letter to dark, disturbing cinema, ""Folie à Deux"" is like the creative hangover, trying to find its way but tripping over its own ambitions. Which is a shame."

5.0,6 October 2024,"I have no words as to how disappointed I am. They should of left Joker as a stand alone movie, this do called sequel was terrible. No story, too many songs, I love Lady Gaga but good god, this wasn't A star is Born.

The first movie was cinematic genius, this was a mish mash of a nothing story, and a musical car crash.

If you expect more of the same as the first movie, don't! It's nothing like it. It's worlds apart. I hope that's the end, because this should never of been made.

I will treat this like the final season of Game of thrones and just completely forget it ever existed.

I'm so angry, it's crazy."
4.0,4 October 2024,
4.0,6 October 2024,"I pretty much enjoyed everything about the first film but unfortunately I found few if any reedming qualities in Joker Folie a Deux.

We pick up two years after the end of the previous movie with Arthur Fleck in the Arkham Asylum in the lead up to his trial for the events in the first film. It is here where he meets Lee Quinzel played by Lady Gaga.

This films tried to be a courtroom drama, romance and a musical amongst other things but unfortunately fails to land any of them particularly well.

Whilst I understand the overall message of the film, the forward and development narrative is so thin that it just feels bland. Nothing really happens, there is no tension and the audience doesn't really have a reason to feel one way or the other about the message the film is giving.

The court room scenes aren't interesting and the musical numbers don't seem to advance the narrative which makes them frustrating when considering the whole package.

This is a very unfortunately sequel that did nothing to enhance or preserve the legacy of the excellent first film."
1.0,7 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed ""Joker"" (2019), directed by Todd Phillips. This film continues the story of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history, delving deeper into the psyche of its central character while exploring new themes and narratives.

One of the standout features of ""Folie à Deux"" is its ambitious approach to storytelling. However, in my opinion, the plot feels underdeveloped; it remains in the background and fails to be either solid or particularly engaging. While the film expands on the psychological complexity, the end result does not fully capture attention as one might expect.

Visually, the film maintains the striking aesthetic that characterized its predecessor. The work of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, combined with Phillips' direction, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional weight of the narrative. However, another aspect that negatively impacted my experience is the presence of musical elements. The stylistic shift from the first ""Joker"" is too evident, and these musical moments feel too abrupt and, at times, irritating.

The performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are consistently top-notch and undoubtedly represent a strong point of the film. Phoenix, reprising his iconic role, delivers a complex mix of vulnerability and intensity, while Gaga adds a new dimension to the story. Despite this, I feel the film is a missed opportunity; the performances of the two actors, while excellent, cannot support a plot that, in my view, fails to shine as it should.

In summary, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" positions itself as a thought-provoking exploration of its characters and the societal constructs surrounding them, but not without flaws. With its strong thematic elements and captivating performances, the film is poised to engage both fans of the original and newcomers, though I personally found it less compelling. While maintaining the profound psychological intensity of its predecessor, this sequel promises to take the story in new and unexpected directions, but it may not meet everyone's expectations."

4.0,4 October 2024,"Let me be clear: I'd give the first Joker movie a 8/10 rating. It was edgy, daring, shocking, memorable.

I absolutely LOVE Gaga and musicals in general, so I was super excited for the sequel ever since it was announced.

We travelled out of town to go to the biggest, loudest screen we could find to watch this.

What a crushing disappointment. Basically NOTHING happens for 2 hours and 20 minutes.

Don't get me wrong, the acting is good from both Phoenix and Gaga - they get 1 star each, hence my 2/10 score. The problem is the most boring script, I don't know what they were thinking. I kept waiting for anything to happen to even remotely match the intensity of the first movie. I'm still waiting.

Sadly this didn't work for me at all!"
1.0,7 October 2024,"Gaga and Phoenix are the only saving grace for this otherwise snoozefest. The story goes nowhere, ever. The music is okay but there's too much of it. Gaga and Phoenix are brilliant actors regardless though. The vibes are creepy and there are a couple of good plot twists. The first hour and a half is a waste of time with the same 10 minutes of storyline dragged out over and over. The story is not an extension at all of the first and the 2nd itself could be wrapped up in a total of 10 minutes. Sometimes the songs worked for the creepy vibes, but mostly they did not. Don't waste your time watching this."
9.0,7 October 2024,"I am an extreme fan and vastly forgiving when it comes to films because I appreciate the industry and its recent struggles. However this film is so lacking that it feels intentional. There are a few satisfactory moments that will likely resonate with Joker fans but for the most part the villain that is quite frankly larger than life and appreciated globally is severely underwhelmed and completely neglected. The only thing that had me on the edge of my seat was the unrewarded anticipation of the actual Joker's arrival. The character that is capable of unfathomable cruelty and maniacal ingenious is not present in this film.. Sad outing for one of the greatest. The biggest let down is that feature films for these type of characters are rarely produced, so to have wasted the opportunity is nothing but heartbreaking. Now that all the Joker character disappointment is assessed I will say the music, cinematography, and acting are top notch which can be expected from such a talented team."
5.0,9 October 2024,"A lot of people are harping on this movie because it's a musical. I loved the fact they used the music to tell the story of love and mental health. It will be a cult classic for sure. My husband and I will back this 100% very well done bravo!!!

Lady Gaga was perfect for this roll. It kept me in suspense and the music was amazing. I will see it again and again and own the DVD when it comes out.

Someone said that it's promoting Lady Gaga's new album . I don't think that's true and even if it was I don't care. To me it had a very deep meaning that because it has the musical parts people are not paying attention to the deeper aspects of it."
3.0,7 October 2024,"I recently had the misfortune of subjecting myself to what can only be described as an absolute abomination of a film. The plot was nonsensical, the acting was laughable at best, and the overall production values seemed to have been scraped together from spare change found between couch cushions. It is truly baffling how such drivel managed to make it past any sort of quality control. The so-called ""director"" should be ashamed of themselves for unleashing this monstrosity onto unsuspecting audiences. I would rather spend two hours staring at a blank wall than ever endure such cinematic torture again. Save yourself the agony and steer clear of this steaming pile of garbage masquerading as a film."

4.0,8 October 2024,"Arthur Fleck, is now confined to a cold, isolated cell in Arkham asylum after his infamous crimes. His isolation feels endless until Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist with her own dark past, enters his life. Arthur, now fully embracing the Joker persona, speaks to her unresolved memory of watching her father stabbing her mother to death. He reveals that only by surrendering to chaos has he found peace and a sense of true freedom.

As Harley listens, her curiosity turns into a dangerous fascination. She's drawn to his unfiltered honesty, the way he speaks about rebellion with a passion that lights up her own repressed darkness. The boundaries she once held firm blur; she becomes promiscuous, losing herself in strangers' arms. Her husband watches helplessly as she spirals-she cuts their children's hair in a grotesque display, tattoos her face, and paints their home in a manic frenzy. When he finally throws her out, she feels nothing but liberation. She is no longer Harleen Quinzel; she is Harley Quinn, Arthur's loyal priestess and the orchestrator of his revolution.

Harley organizes protests and rallies, channeling her newfound madness into a growing movement. What begins as a grassroots rebellion against society's cruelty evolves into a full-fledged gang. She becomes the engineer behind the Joker's uprising, transforming the city with her fiery passion.

Meanwhile, Arthur's trial looms. The lawyers want to plead insanity, but Arthur refuses-he insists Arthur Fleck is dead. Firing his legal team, he represents himself, bringing the people who failed him to the stand. One by one, he exposes the social worker who abandoned him as a child, the shrink who didn't care, and the show secretary who set up the cruel TV ambush with Murray. The climactic moment arrives when Harley herself takes the stand, declaring their twisted love with a devotion so raw and impassioned that it stuns the courtroom.

The jury, moved or manipulated by the Joker's performance, delivers a shocking verdict: not guilty. Arthur walks free, and his victory feels like a triumph for every lost soul in Gotham.

Years later, the Joker has become a cultural phenomenon. He runs a controversial podcast, captivating millions with his unapologetic and incendiary rhetoric. He even announces a run for office, his growing base of loyal followers sees him as a messiah. When his political ambitions are mocked and ridiculed, he retreats to the shadows, unleashing his criminal organization in full force. Harley, his ever-loyal queen, stands beside him as they take down corrupt politicians and mobsters, creating a dark legacy that shakes Gotham to its core waiting for his nemesis to come out of the shadows."
1.0,2 October 2024,"I went into the new Joker film with high hopes, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver. For the first time in my life, I actually fell asleep in the cinema - twice! The movie was painfully slow, with almost no real story to grab onto. The pacing was so off that I found myself just waiting for it to end, hoping that my own boredom would end with it.

They really messed up what should've been a masterful scene, making it feel lackluster instead of gripping. Lady Gaga's voice was the only saving grace, adding a touch of quality to an otherwise underwhelming film. While it's clear the cinematography was well-executed, the film's visuals couldn't make up for the lack of substance.

Overall, it felt like a beautifully shot, but ultimately hollow, movie. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll so I could escape my misery."

Genuinely it's crap in fact Crap doesn't describe how poor this movie is what were they thinking, Lady Gaga is shocking she should never make another movie again for the love of god WHY WHY WHY.

When a you read daring on a movie poster you know it's gonna be terrible but this takes terrible to an all new level of terribleness.

Wait until this movie is released or shown on TV and when it is throw the TV out of the window and don't watch it! It's the worst sequel EVER my goodness this is a bad movie."

If you like the first Joker, don't waste your time seeing this! People were leaving the cinema the minute Lady Gaga burst into her 11th song of the movie! Don't get me wrong, Joaquin Phoenix's acting was top form, but there just doesn't appear to be a story line! I really had high hopes for this film and we all waited a very long time for its release, devastated it wasn't what we were all expecting! 5 stars purely for Joaquin! I really don't understand how you can go from something so sensational to something so mediocre, I am devastated for Joaquin as this is his only sequel!"
4.0,13 October 2024,"Here's a revised version with a few tweaks for grammar and flow:

I initially didn't want to see the movie after reading all the bad reviews, but I thought I'd give it a go, thinking maybe it was misunderstood. I hoped that, by putting aside the superhero expectations, it might have a deeper meaning and still be good. Unfortunately, I was wrong - it really is as bad as they say. I kept waiting for something to happen, and just when you thought it might, it turned out to be anticlimactic and disappointing. It's such a shame because the first film was so good, and the second one could have been just as good, but it just felt unnecessary."
8.0,14 October 2024,"It's hard to imagine a more disappointing sequel than the new Joker movie. The first film, with its raw, gritty take on the iconic character, was both an homage and a reinterpretation of two cinematic masterpieces (Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy). While many appreciated Todd Phillips' ability to weave these influences into a gripping narrative, this sequel abandons that careful storytelling approach and falls into a mess of misplaced ideas and a jarring tonal shift.

One of the biggest missteps of this movie is its decision to incorporate a musical element. The musical numbers feel completely out of place, adding nothing to the film's tone or atmosphere. Rather than using the music to enrich the emotional depth or tension of the scenes, they come off as unnecessary distractions. They detract from the intensity and gritty realism that made the first Joker so powerful. For a character as complex and psychologically tortured as Arthur Fleck, suddenly bursting into song feels absurd, undercutting the darkness that the first movie established so well.

On top of that, the plot takes an unfortunate detour into what seems like a drawn-out courtroom drama. It drags the pacing down to a crawl, making the film feel more like a procedural than the chaotic descent into madness that fans expect. Courtroom scenes dominate the movie, yet they add little to the overall story, serving more as filler than a vehicle for real character development. By relying so heavily on this setting, the film ends up feeling stagnant, lacking the drive or energy that would have kept viewers engaged.

One of the biggest frustrations is that the film doesn't even seem to care about telling a cohesive story. Unlike the first movie, which followed Arthur Fleck's transformation into Joker with a clear arc, this sequel loses focus midway through. It begins to meander, introducing characters and plot points that never really go anywhere. There's no sense of narrative cohesion, and it feels as though the film is giving up on its own premise halfway through.

The relationship dynamics also feel rushed and hollow. Instead of building up characters and exploring their inner lives, the movie throws them together without any meaningful development. The relationships are shallow, and because we haven't spent enough time understanding the characters' motivations or their emotional states, it's impossible to care about what happens between them. Without this foundational character work, the film's attempts to explore personal connections fall flat, lacking the emotional weight necessary to make them compelling.

In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a total misfire. Where the first film was grounded in psychological exploration and a masterful blend of inspirations, this sequel is a bloated, directionless mess. Between the poorly executed musical elements, the dull courtroom drama, and the lack of character development, it's hard to find anything redeeming here. For fans of the original Joker, this sequel will likely be a huge disappointment and something they'd rather forget. Unfortunately, it's not just a waste of time-it also undermines everything that made the first film so special."

5.0,13 October 2024,"I had a couple of G&Ts before going to see this. I hate musicals and the reviews are so bad, I thought I might get anxiety during the movie but I had promised my friend I would go!

I read a review on here calling it a hate crime, which is a great review and very entertaining, but it left me really bracing myself for total disaster. Funnily enough however, I didn't hate it. I did leave the auditorium during the musical bits because I couldn't justify them breaking into song.... this aspect was bizarre and a total fail IMO but the rest of the movie was pretty good. Gaga is great in her role as is Joaquin, It just didn't need to be a musical."
2.0,6 October 2024,"Despite the anticipation surrounding Joker: Folie à Deux, the sequel falls flat on nearly every level. Where the original film captivated audiences with its gritty realism and compelling character study, this installment feels like a hollow attempt to recapture that magic.

The decision to incorporate musical elements was baffling. Instead of adding depth to Arthur Fleck's fractured psyche, the sudden shifts into musical sequences feel jarring and out of place, detracting from the tension and atmosphere that defined the first film. Rather than serving as an artistic expression of his descent into madness, the choreography and singing come off as a disjointed spectacle that undermines the dark tone.

Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a disappointing follow-up that tries to push boundaries but ends up lost in its own ambition. It's a film that confuses spectacle for substance and risks diluting the impact of the original by stretching a character study into something it was never meant to be: a spectacle of chaotic musical numbers and shallow melodrama."
5.0,5 October 2024,"First, I'm a superfan of the comic book genre. First Joker movie = genius, we know that. This movie...we were bamboozled. Don't waste your money. Leave the image of the first movie in your mind and ignore they made a second folie.

Phoenix's acting was strong and convincing, similar to the first movie. That's all I can say positive.

This movie had potential, but the poor plot, annoying musical reliance, weak connection to source material, lack of violence, and lack of a sex icon in the HQ character, led to a flop.

At one point, I thought they were salvaging the movie, then they pulled a u-turn and returned to the boring misery leaving everyone confused again.

One more ray of light...the last 5 minutes was cool, so maybe speak into the ending before seeing another movie (Deadpool?). Sorry."
5.0,4 October 2024,"This is the DC pattern where their first movie is an art but then subsequent movies are sooo heavily interfered by studios that the follow up a pile of c*ap.

This is what happens when a sub par one tone acting talent like lady gaga takes over the script and production and the story takes a back seat to her singing. She had nearly 2 lines in the whole movie without singing them and 0 character development or story. Mr. Phoenix killed it as expected but gaga was complete s*it. Was sooo excited and by the end we wanted to act like Artur and kill everyone. Watch this movie on a flight or something when you are not able to sleep. It will out you out or make you throw up."
8.0,8 October 2024,"It has been some time since I was looking forward to a film this much.

Then I started to hear ""well , it's going to be kind of a musical"" and my soul started to die just knowing this was going to be a problem.

Still though , I figured he did it right last time for what he was going for so chin up it will be good right?

We have seen the main players in this film in many past roles and awards have been won by all so it can't be the talent.

Many of the songs are timeless classics so probably not that either.

Weather her music is for you or not Gaga has some serious sales numbers and a catalog that one can find something to enjoy in , so they asked her to ""sound bad when she sings""????

Is it a court drama? Law & Order is better on most weeks and , thankfully , also shorter.

Is it a musical? Not really enough music to fit that bill and frankly the plot to Tommy made more sense.

Is it a comic book movie? Maybe an unfinished mini series by Silver Wolf that just faded out from lack of interest I guess.

Is it good? Lord no.

No matter what it is you will come into this film expecting it will let you down in every way.

Even if you come in hoping to just see the train wreck Todd created as a clear and blatant cash grab even in that it just falls flatter than a fart no one else ever hears.

And that is it isn't it? This was all just a cash grab by the production.

Todd Phillips should have learned he was not very good with sequels the last time around.

Gaga is no Margot Robbie in the role of Harley. Phoenix looks like he realized what he was into after he was already contractually obligated.

Go re-watch the first. Go watch one of the Harley flicks or the as good as gold season 1 of the cartoon she had. Go clip your nails. Just go do anything but waste the time you have in an already short life wasting it on this.

I already did , spare yourself."

First of all it has a lot of unecessary songs that dont really help the plot while they add up time that makes the movie exosting . Really poor character developement for Harley Queen as she never becomes the actual Harley Queen . Also the repeatabily of the scenes in jail is just boring and it adds-up to the already exosting songs . To add up this movie is not about the Joker . Arthur becomes Joker only for a couple of scenes and the switch between Arthur's two characters is too steep . To be honest though the ""secret"" meanings of the movie are good and delivered superbly . For me the only people that should see this movie are the ones that havent seen the first one although I would suggest watching the first one instead . In conclusion the movie is too long and it comes poor compared to the original movie with the only thing that makes it worth watching being the incredible acting of Joaquin Phoenix and the remarkable filming ."
5.0,4 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a frustratingly disappointing sequel that fails to capture the intensity and psychological depth of the original. What should have been a gripping exploration of Arthur Fleck's further descent into madness instead becomes a muddled, aimless story bogged down by an ill-fitting musical element. The chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga feels forced, and the film's attempts at surrealism come off as pretentious rather than meaningful. Visually striking but emotionally hollow, it leans too heavily on style without substance. A major letdown for fans of the original."

Trying to pull it off twice was a tall order but I didn't quite expect it to go this way.

The film is set two years after the first one with Arthur Fleck locked up and awaiting his trial and, while in there, meets Lee Quinn in a musical therapy group.

The first flaw, for me, was that this really isn't much of a storyline to sustain a film well over two hours, it's just too long! It really does drag in parts.

Secondly Todd Phillips can dress it up all he likes but this is definitely a musical. Now admittedly it isn't as bad as I thought. It's not like they're singing every two minutes and at first some of the musical scenes actually work but after a while they started to grate on me.

The performances from everyone are superb except for Steve Coogan who makes a completely unnecessary appearance as Alan Partridge with an American accent.

There's another brilliant film in here somewhere but it just gets too bogged down in its own self indulgence. The wacky opening scene was annoying and just added, like lots of other uneeded bits, to an already too long run time.

I get where they were going with this at times, and it was almost clever, but it didn't quite come together for me but nice try anyway.

I did get a kick out of characters, from the original, turning up in court to discuss how Arthur's behaviour affected them and I liked the use of a couple of locations from the first film.

Sadly it just fails to build on the first film. There's no stand out moments, like Joker dancing down the steps outside his apartment or the wonderful dialogue on The Murray Franklin Show, you almost feel like it's going to happen and then it falls flat.

Despite all that in a year full of let down sequels this, at least, wasn't completely terrible. I will definitely give it another watch to see how it works without my expectations up. But for now I shall sit on the fence and say that despite the fact it wasn't brilliant it also wasn't quite as bad as feared by early negative reviews so it's middle diddle for Joker Folie a Deux with a 5/10."

2.0,4 October 2024,"Comparing this movie to the first one, is a humillation to the Joker of 2019. It have good things, yes. The colors and the design of each scene and its the best here, is beautiful in all scenes, until you see that the movie is slow, try to define another time the movie and do it too bored, that the music is forgottable. Joaquin Foenix act good the middle to final of the movie, but Lady Gaga act as a no Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie was 10 times better than this excuse of movie that its own director I think that do it bored and abominable because was obligate to do a secuel of Joker, Joker: Folie á Deux can rest in peace and only imagine that exist Joker of 2019 only."
1.0,9 October 2024,"""Joker:Folie a Deux"" is a sequel that they never really thought of making. Only after the vast popularity of ""Joker"" have they given it a thought of making a sequel. The thing is this movie doesn't really connect. Its biggest issue is that at its core it doesn't really know the story it wants to tell. Joaquin Phoenix returns as the titular character but there are moments here where he feels less grant than the original movie. Lady Gaga is criminally underused. Although they almost filmed it like a musical, Lady Gaga sings less than Phoenix. It also plays as romance,and sometimes as a court room drama. The truth is the movie is a little bit of all of those genres and that's not bad. What is bad though is how they never really understood how to navigate all these genres to make a coherent story. The movie ends and you feel numb but you really have to try a lot to see how everything that happened falls in place in the story. The themes do come together at the end, but it should have been a more coherent storytelling. ""Joker:Folie a Deux"" is a long underwhelming sequel. It goes to show that Phillips' Joker was only good for what he already showed us before."
8.0,7 October 2024,"Definitely a different piece of cinema from the usual tropes. It is thought provoking and incredibly surreal piece of work.

Go into it with the mindset of this is an unreliable narration from a clearly very disturbed individual.

Think about the musical aspects as a sound track to fantasy or a cartoon and then it makes more sense. Its a story where everything cant really be taken at face value. Lighting, color correction and storyboarding did a pretty impressive job. Some frames had a painterly quality so imagine Dede Eri Supria's clowns invaded a Edward Hopper's diner.

Left the cinema with some good talk points."
1.0,11 October 2024,"I saw this movie in the imax theater 3 days before it officially came out, because of this experience I had time to formulate my own opinion before people started spewing hate, including people who haven't watched it. Let's begin: First off I would like to say this is not a ""perfect"" movie, but it is a good one. It has a significant meaning and good themes, specifically about how people care more about a man's idea than the man himself.

This movie takes place two years after Arthur goes to jail, he's been able to see and figure out, from what little outside contact he has, just how big the symbol he created ""joker"", impacted the world and the people in it.

This movie is partly a musical, rather than Arthur dancing and imagining fake experiences like in the first one, Arther imagines himself in a broadway musical. This is a JUKEBOX musical, so the songs are covers, and Gaga and Phoenix sing them amazingly.

This movie is really good, and when you understand the meaning, including the meaning of the ending, this movie will likely leave a lasting impact on you.

I don't usually write reviews, but I strongly recommend this movie and it makes me sad to see all these hate reviews."
1.0,6 October 2024,
5.0,5 October 2024,"I never leave negative reviews. I try to find something positive about any film I see and spend money on. Joker was a complete waste of time. There was no plot, no point, completely dark and bleak! And to portray it as a fantasy musical was beyond bizarre! I found zero entertainment and redemption in it. I wonder why a film like this is made? Do producers, the director and actors actually believe in the product? If so, they're in a bubble and are delusional. If I could get my money back, I would. Surprised I sat through the whole thing, kept waiting for something to happen and it didn't. I wish I could recommend it but I can't. Seems that most reviews on the IMDB board agree. Joker has a well-deserved low score. Sorry."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I just don't know with this movie.

It's not bad, but I can't say with confidence that it's good.

It felt like one of those films that might get better on rewatches - not least when it comes to streaming & you can fast forward through some of the musical numbers, which just exist outside of one or two.

The ending makes no sense with a series of events playing out with no attempt at explanation or with the movie having earned them after what can only be described as a deus ex machina.

The positives are that the film looks amazing & more of Phoenix's Arthur Fleck is always welcome, but it's not enough to justify a movie that, given the obvious stand alone nature of its predecessor, struggled to justify its existence.

I want to like this movie & there's things about it I love, but I struggle to say it's a good or necessary movie for far too many reasons to let those things outweigh that."
2.0,9 October 2024,"If you are a die hard Joker fan and love a good musical tragedy, then this is the film for you. If you are expecting an action packed sequel that further explores the Joker character, then this isn't the movie for you. There was just too much of Arther and not enough of Joker. Furthermore, there was a clear limit to Joker's potential by trying to not resemble Kieth Ledger's version. If there was more freedom to explore the dramatic nature of Joker's personality, then the film would have been more of a success. Throughout the film, there were a lot of mysteries that kept me entertained, but didn't turn out as satisfying as they did in the first movie. Finally, the film evokes numerous emotions and may effect the audience in an angy matter."
9.0,5 October 2024,"As in the original strong acting and interesting characters, but just 5 stars for this one. The first movie I gave only 7. Really good, but I wasn't all hyped up about it.

What bothered me a lot in this sequel was the singing. As with any musical I just see no reason for it. It did not add anything to the story and in here it fitted like a square peg in a round hole. Could have saved 40 minutes of my time and the movie already would have been better. The only movie where I can remember this being done right is ""Dancer In The Dark""

And although well brought I think there could have been more inside Lee's character than just a love interest."
1.0,4 October 2024,
2.0,6 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux is a mixed bag. The film includes far too many musical numbers that feel unnecessary and often disrupt the dark, gritty tone you'd expect from a Joker movie. While the concept of blending musical elements with the story is ambitious, the execution leaves much to be desired. The screenplay drags heavily in the first half, making it hard to stay engaged, and only really picks up in the last 40 minutes. By then, it feels like too little, too late.

Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers a solid performance, bringing the intensity you'd expect. However, Lady Gaga's character doesn't allow her to fully explore her range, which feels like a missed opportunity given her talent. The chemistry between them is underwhelming, and Gaga's character arc is not as compelling as it could have been. Overall, it's not a must-see in theaters and could be better suited for watching at home, where the drawn-out pacing and musical interludes feel less disruptive."""
5.0,11 October 2024,"Let me start off by saying I liked ths first Joker 2019 film didn't love it but I liked it. Todd Phillips the director was clearly never interested in telling an actual story about Joker he wanted to make a drama about a mentally ill man using some of the themes of the Joker character to sell it to the masses. Now with that said you can only really do that once. It's incredibly hard to make a sequel with a Joker who isn't a criminal mastermind who's just a mentally ill man with no plans or anything thats why the first Joker was best kept as a one off. So let's get into Joker 2.

Story This movie retcons elements of the first Joker like him embracing his Joker identity at the end so it can once again focus on Arthur the man and not the Joker. Arthur isnon trial for the murders he did in the first if he's declared sane he gets death if he's declared insane he gets life. From the start this makes little sense as this character is clearly crazy no court on earth would find this dude sane lol. Next we have Harley Quin played by Lady Gaga she plays an inmate that Arthur falls in love with but she doesn't get much to do throughout the movie. The trailers make you think she's going to be the 2nd main character and the film will be about there love story and them falling in love through shared insanity but that isn't what director Todd Phillips goes for. Instead he tries to divert expectations most of the time and what we get instead just isn't that interesting and mostly retreads stuff from Joker 2019 and repeats his arc from Joker 2019.

Acting Phoenix does good here but he isn't great like part one really no one is great in this but no one was bad either. I think the problem with Phoenix performance here is he was more subdued and even when he becomes more Joker like it never feels like the Joker he played in part 1. Some of the story beats we get with his Joker in this don't even make sense in context of the first film. Lady Gaga also does good here she's a great actor but her role diminishes the longer the movie goes on and even though they deleted some of her scenes from the trailers I don't think her part in this ever would have been great with this script. The rest of the acting is good again no one was great in this but it's not the actors fault there parts are all underwritten.

Directing The directing is competent film has good visuals and some good shots.

Overall This film is to long and lacks focus it had some interesting ideas but never followed through with them properly instead trying to do to much and not executing them successfully especially by the end which wasn't earned at all. Overall this is easily the worst Live action interpretation of the Joker on screen and Todd Phillips has for better or worse made the movie he wanted to make and all future and past versions of Joker are going to look better by comparasion. I forgot to mention the film is also a musical but it isn't at the same time. I say this because the movie for long periods will have no musical sequences then start them back and the musical sequences we get are grounded and mostly low key so the fun and excitement you normally get with musicals isn't even here. This would be a 0 out of 10 for me if IMDB would let me give it that but it really is the worst comic inspired film I have ever seen. It isn't the worst made Madame Webb was worse made but it was entertainingly bad while this was just dull and bland and overly serious."
5.0,6 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a cinematic misfire that should never have been made. The film is excessively long, self-serious, and narratively incoherent, failing to engage audiences despite the star power of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. Its attempt at a musical format feels forced and monotonous, with songs that blur together into a tedious wall of sound. The plot is stagnant, offering little more than repetitive scenes in a courtroom and prison, leaving viewers questioning its purpose. Ultimately, it's a regrettable sequel that squanders its potential and serves as a cash grab rather than a meaningful continuation of the story."
1.0,4 October 2024,"Let's agree Joaquin performance is a world class actor and he made the Joker character more interesting.. I was looking forward to seeing part 2 and witness another masterpiece from him... Guess what !! I can't believe he lowered his standards and accepted the movie as is .... it is a complete failure attempt to turn such a legacy into musical... I couldn't believe they employed a great performer such as Lady Gaga to act in such big movie that requires certain standards of acting skills... she didn't make any impact and yet I have no clue why she was there...

i was at the cinema and watched most of the movie hoping to get something good, but unfortunately I had to leave before it ends, because it was so boring and ridiculous..

SHAME X 3."
9.0,5 October 2024,"I WANT MY MONEY BACK! Complete garbage so bad it dismantled the masterpiece that was the first movie. I'm guessing lady Gaga had more than something to do with this! She probably wrote or something to do with the musical/ embarrassment of the, well we can't call it a franchise cause they ruined both with this one. A first in cinema history! A sequel so bad it actually dismantled and scrubbed the first with shame and disgrace! Atleast I only paid .50c for parking and I'm actually angry I paid and waisted my time at all! If I had know this was a musical, I never would've ever went. That's disrespect/ a primate can through excrement through a fence and hit you in the face! I could've stayed home and never spent money or time and felt the disrespect and shame if I had known they made it a musical and let it burn and I avoided the disgraceful cesspool! ABSOLUTELY TRASH! Embarrassment to all the movies ever made."
2.0,5 October 2024,
1.0,6 October 2024,"After the first movie, is this really what you came up with?

Joker 2 is a mess, straight up. Turning the first movie's gritty vibe into some kinda musical was a bad move. The songs don't fit at all, they just mess with the flow and kill the tension. What made Joker good was the raw, real feel of it, and now it's like they're tryna make it quirky or something.

Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn doesn't even save it. Her scenes feel awkward, and the whole musical vibe just makes the movie drag. If you wanted a deep dive into Arthur's mind, this ain't it. They lost what made the first one dope.

You ruined it, congrats."
5.0,6 October 2024,"I'd rather drink poison than watch this movie again. It's insulting to the senses. Bored out of my mind. I love cinema. But this isn't cinema. It's obsessed with itself from an artistic perspective. Like ""look at me and how artsy I am"". So much ""pick me"" energy. I've lost faith in Hollywood.

The only redeeming quality was some humor in the beginning that made me chuckle. But I fell asleep 4 or 5 times and woke up angry that it wasn't over. I would have walked out but I was with a friend. It took every ounce of my patience to stay in my seat.

This movie reminded me of how I feel when I see a ""modern art"" display somewhere and it's not even close to what art should be. This movie was purposefully designed to be contradictory to the first to make viewers upset. I'm never watching any of Todd Phillips' movies ever again if that's how he wants to play it."
1.0,10 October 2024,"Given the slew of negative reviews, my expectations for *Joker 2* were rather low. However, in its defence I found it wasn't quite as dreadful as anticipated.

First, let's talk positives: the cinematography effectively captured the grimness of Arkham Asylum. I found the slow-burning storyline intriguing. Although not much happens, the visual storytelling kept me engaged-at least until we hit the courtroom scenes.

Now for the downsides. The film is peppered with random musical numbers that feel entirely out of place. It seems this turned into a vanity project for Lady Gaga, with Joaquin Phoenix's involvement coming off as delusional and egotistical. Some scenes were outright cringeworthy, with Phoenix looking visibly embarrassed while dancing in the dreary asylum. A few dream sequence musical numbers might have been tolerable, but this was overkill.

The film's portrayal of the Joker's infatuation with Lee is another misstep. He comes across as old, tired, beaten, and weird. Lee doesn't appear crazy enough to be obsessed with him. Additionally, the courtroom scenes drag on unnecessarily. The oscillation between Joker's ego, Arthur Fleck's beaten demeanor, and the genius-crazy Joker is hard to believe.

In summary, *Joker 2* is a disappointing sequel that attempts to be clever and unique but ends up being ridiculous and muddled."
5.0,5 October 2024,
8.0,4 October 2024,"I have to come up with 600 characters even though the title really sums it up. Todd Phillips wants to be Scorsese so bad but he's always going to be the guy who directed Old School and The Hangover and then whined about not being able to do comedy anymore for...reasons?

The first Joker was pretty decent but I was never as enamored with it as a lot of people were. Trying to make a character like Arthur Fleck sympathetic to the point of being an anti-hero is questionable story telling at best. He's ill and was let down by poor healthcare but that's more about how terrible the U. S. is about that sort of thing, not indicative to how a society(tm) let him down. Not having accountability means you're not a good person.

Anyway, I don't want to really give anything away but I found this to be very boring and overstuffed with nonsense. This was clearly a self fellating project for Phoenix and Phillips. Giving too much creative control leads to garbage like this."
2.0,10 October 2024,"Anyone currently panning 'Joker: Folie à Deux' will be on the wrong side of (film) history...and possibly history in general. It happened with 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' and looks like JFAD is the victim of a similar fan backlash for not being the film people wanted. I won't do a breakdown of why I found this a challenging, rewarding and moving film as I hate spoilers but I was as surprised by this Joker film as I was by the first though for different reasons. If you think you bought a ticket for a super anti-hero film, you may be disappointed and confused. If you are prepared to watch a film that follows a line of truth where the undercurrents of a relationship and distortions of media and fame interphase with mental illness you will have a very different experience. It is, at worst, a very very good film. For me, it was a great film, but sadly in the current era when people don't get what they want the toys come out of the pram. To rate it as many seem to have done - against their expectations and hopes - is human but to then dismiss it as a bad film on that basis...well I guess that's human too and we've all done it. Sadly, in the social media age negative feedback gets amplified and JFAD has suffered from the pile on. Again, a great film that I suspect will stand the test of time."
5.0,6 October 2024,"This movie has no soul. It's an empty story that uses great actors/actresses to sell it. For those who are familiar with Joker's last movies, this one is definitely incoherent when it comes to quality.

Full of violence without a proper narrative. Music is not good, although they positioned the movie as almost a musical, given lady gaga acting.

Dissapointed with Phoenix, a great a conscious guy, accepting such empty role. Although his acting is always pretty good.

They've made this movie only for the money. Unfurtanately this ""bid brands"" abuse of their own continuation in order to make profits, in disregard of the sort of content they are generating.

Do not recommend."
5.0,12 October 2024,"Basically, the whole movie is about the trial that Arthur Fleck (Joker) is going through a trial that doesn't have any point at all. He is accused of six murders he committed (one of them on live TV). What would you expect the outcome to be? That he's found 'not guilty'? It doesn't make any sense at all. All I want to say is that the main plot lacks excitement for the viewer because the outcome is obvious.

Another, even more stupid part of the movie is the musical scenes , they don't fit at all in any aspect of the film. Scenes where Joker and Harley Quinn are in their 'fantasy world' (some unconscious part of them) dancing and singing make no sense, especially not in a drama or tragedy movie like this.

It's a movie that was never intended to have a sequel, so it lacks purpose. It's a movie without a real story , made just to make money and nothing more.

And they succeeded in that part, so don't be surprised if they announce a third part of Joker movies ... We don't know if Joker really died at the end if they want more money, they can do whatever they want."
5.0,6 October 2024,"I wanted to root for something but something was missing from the entire film. Thus nothing to root for. An analogy befitting of the movie's reluctance to embrace the character of Joker. 'We can no longer believe in Joker because the Joker doesn't believe in himself' I hope the director knows that that's what killed the film? I'm not one to glorify mental illness or such topics however I wanted to watch a brilliant actor do brilliant, calculated and menacing things on screen. Perhaps cause some trouble or riots in Gotham. Riding the tidal wave from the first film. Show me a VILLAIN. Instead the whole film was confused, frustrating, boring and weak. The film itself didn't want to delve further in the subject matter that Phillips delved in the first film."
1.0,6 October 2024,"Maybe it was designed that way on purpose? It is hard to find another explanation. Yes, i liked the atmosphere, the acting of the main actors. This director, these actors and characters had great potential to be a special continuation of the story, but unfortunately it did not happen. It's a pity. I was a fan of the first part of Joker, and while watching the second part, I still couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching someone's poor hallucination of an unfinished thought. Like a bad dream with fragments of images and songs - no story. Joker had much more potential. It's a pity. As I said in the beginning - maybe it was design that way. To dissapoint us just to come back for the thirt part with something really really big."
10.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is the long-awaited sequel to Joker, arriving five years after the original film's release. Todd Phillips returns to direct, backed by much of the talented crew that helped elevate the first film beyond what could've easily been a messy, indulgent experience. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher once again gives the film its distinctive, haunting visual style, Mark Friedberg's production design remains immersive, and Hildur Guðnadóttir's score is as evocative as ever. On a technical level If anything it's a alot worse off,especially in terms of costuming, storyline and direction of film which noticeably takes a dip in every levels."
2.0,4 October 2024,
1.0,8 October 2024,"This is an absolutely horrible film. There is no edginess, there is no drama, the courtroom scenes are flaccid, the love interest isn't interesting at all. Other than some minor rehashing of the past, there is no crime, no conspiracies, no nothing.

I had expected some carry-over or continuation from the Riddler and Joker repartee at the end of the last movie (The Batman), but, for some strange reason, even that was neglected here.

The studio mistakenly thought that this would be another money-maker slam dunk for them but they failed to put in the same effort as was done in the original.

A tremendous waste of acting."
1.0,8 October 2024,"How did this happen? I can only assume that somebody wanted to get the biggest gap (in ratings) between a movie and its sequel. Highlander 2 did this, and actually produced a better movie at the end of it all. And Highlander 2 is renowned for its awfulness.

If you brutally edited this travesty, you could perhaps get a one hour vaguely-OK prologue to ""Joker"" that nobody wants or needs. Otherwise, this is just a sad waste of life that Phoenix and Gaga should both quickly disown like they'd been blackmailed into shooting. All this movie does is fool you, within the first 15 minutes, into thinking it MIGHT be ok. Then it goes to extraordinary lengths to disappoint you."
3.0,15 October 2024,"I don't understand the hatred towards this movie. It certainly isn't a masterpiece and is flawed, but to hate it? Y'all sound like a bunch of whiney fan boys having a hissy fit. Lmao the storyline was kinda dull until the second half, but the musical moments are what made the movie likeable in my opinion. If it wasn't for them I'd probably have fallen asleep. Gaga was excellent. The storyline was just a little dull and the sequel overall seemed unnecessary, but I enjoyed it. Considering who the joker is and what's going on in his mind, it makes sense that this movie is a musical, because most of it is performed in his delusional mind. Lighten up and chill out. It was an enjoyable work of art."
5.0,14 October 2024,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Get ready for nothing. It is an example of how annoying Hollywood is. I have no respect for Joaquin Phoenix. You realize after this movie that all he does is play dress up and read lines. Anyone can do that. What makes a movie good is the storyline, not actors. Acting is the most overrated profession. You will think about that after you see this movie. Whoever thinks that this movie is a piece of art must also think that the homeless guy on meth who plays guitar at the end of your street is Eric Clapton. This is trash. You will see. Go waste 30 bucks."
10.0,10 October 2024,"So, before watching this movie, I rewatched Joker (2019) and I loved it. It is one of my favuote DC movies ever. Possibly my 3rd fav. But it felt like a standalone to me. So I didn't seem to care too much about potential sequals. But when I first saw the trailer scene of Joker dancing with Lady Gaga, I thought it looked awesome. Even though it was confirmed to be a muwsical, I was pretty open minded. The first 40 mins of this film is actually pretty good, and I was confuseed as to why people hated the film. Some musical scenes were decent. But as we got into the 2nd and 3rd act, I started to understand the HATE. It is so slow, messy and boring. The biggest joe of the film (no oun intended) is that it is so boring. HOW DO YOU MAKE A BORING FILM WITH TWO OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN ALL OF DC? The middle act went on and on and I was BORED. The final act did capture my attention, but it all felt meaningless. While I do understand what Todd Phillips was trying to do with the ending, it falls flat on it's face when the movie seems so unfocused. I didn't care for the ending as I didn't even enjoy the majority of the movie. Very underwhelming and a bit dissapointing. I don't recommend wasting your time watching this. But if you are curious, then please, go check it out. Overall, I will rate it 5/10. It is a ""MEH"" Movie."
1.0,6 October 2024,"The reference to Bandwagon (the classic film they watch) is not by chance. Neither is the throwaway cartoon at the beginning. This is a film about what 'Joker' does for and to Arthur, and society - and it's not pretty.

I think it was a mistake not to make it clearer in marketing that it's a musical, which is one of the reasons many people hate it. The other reason is that this is partly a critique of why people loved and felt represented by Joker' the persona, and a lot of that goes for people who loved Joker the film, too.

I'd like to rewatch this. There's a lot of detail and themes in it that would probably benefit from a second viewing."
1.0,3 October 2024,"There are times when you get your peak high ,it's best to let it be and enjoy the high then attempt to go anywhere near it. Producers,actor and director all kinda fell prey to the success both financially and otherwise as well and They came up with something that has nothing to do with the jokers legacy or the jokers phychotic ways but they just chose to be realist ...and also go musical it all was a superbly bad bad idea.it is hard to sit 150 mins for this ...dampest squib of all time.. phoenix is exceptional from scene 1 ...giving his all showing his feeble body . The pain the frustration all shows up. Gaga didn't do any justice to a half baked charchter."
3.0,3 October 2024,"A morbid prison musical tailored to Lady Gaga in which Phoenix is brilliant in the same way he was in the first Joker. In any case, the music is great as are the others in supporting roles. Nothing was left of Gotham or the story of Batman, and in comparison to the first film about the Joker, everything that held the story together was missing. The film is worth watching for the excellent costumes, mask, camera and close-ups of the two main actors that keep you awake until this hour too long film is over. Certainly, the money for the pre-premiere screening could have been better spent, so I doubt that I will ever watch another Hollywood film at an expensive time slot."
1.0,6 October 2024,
5.0,3 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a film that finds itself in the middle and balances between being good or bad, in other words it is ""decent"" or ""so-so"". By adding the musical genre, the script is strange to the concept presented in the first film, and does not have that avant-garde element that director Todd Phillips hoped to capture. The script touches on interesting elements about a social idol, who creates a cult and who, by presenting himself as he really is, divides opinions among his fans, apart from this, the script fails to go further. The cinematography is good being the strong point of the film. The musical numbers manage to be of mixed quality, there are good ones and bad ones. The production level is high, making it the most notable positive point of this sequel. Joaquin Phoenix's performance declines compared to the first film and Lady Gaga achieves a good role that loses intensity in the plot. Todd Phillips' work as director is very average on this occasion. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a film with ups and downs that works in some scenes."
10.0,6 October 2024,"Disappointing after a long anticipated wait - could cut half the songs out, this is not a musical! The amount of unnecessary songs and singing just made this movie drag and I caught myself clock watching, which is a first for me!!! Gaga totally ruined it for me.

A real lack of attention went into continuity of the previous movie in relation to characters and relationships, felt disjointed.

Joaquim undeniably was incredible and deserved all 4 stars I have rated this.

A LONG movie with too much sing song, SO much potential but they really missed the mark with this one.

1.0,4 October 2024,"How do you follow a masterpiece like the Joker?

Answer, in this case you fail and fail spectacularly. The whole film felt like it was put together from deleted scenes. The pacing is slower than a snail race. Non of the characters get any development or decent dialogue. One of the best thing of The Joker was you was never quite sure what was really happening or what was part of his delusion, in this it's very clear what's real what isn't. And that is one of the main issues of what is wrong with this.

The other main issue is the complete absence of chemistry between the two leads. In all the versions of the Joker/Harlequin the have a love\hate relationship but here you never believe that's the case.

This film dose a rare thing, makes you think the first film wasn't as good as your first impression

As for the ending........... I'll leave it there."

1.0,5 October 2024,"I purposely avoided anything talking about joker 2 before going to see it as someone who thoroughly enjoyed the first movie even with the fact that it's basically just a really well-made copy of taxi driver.

Like many I was surprised a big budget modern movie could actually make me feel something and it's no surprise joker 1 made 1 billion at the box offfice and we widely regarded amongst everyday movie goers as great and scored well with fans myself included.

It felt like a real movie in a see of marvel schlock.

Todd Phillips doesn't like that we sympathized with Arthur's plite and thinks we all got the wrong idea and wants to make this film just to show you his pure distane at you personally for not seeing Arthur the way HE wants you to because we're all so dumb and he's infinitely smarter than all of us.

So what do we get with this film? It's a deconstruction of the first film, with meta elements similar to the matrix 4, if you loved that movie then this is for you and you alone, for everyone else you will hate this film, it's trying so hard to stick a middle finger up at you as revenge for you not enjoying joker 1 the way todd wanted you to and for daring to have your own opinions and to think for yourself and see Arthur Fleck like Todd wanted you to, a sad and pathetic loser who was worth nothing and committed horrible atrocities (in his view) who deserved no sympathy, after the fact (once the movie released and was a massive success)

The movie is a beautiful train wreck, it looks visually stunning and is well shot and the technical aspects are pretty much 10/10 but is made purely as an F U to all those who loved the first. It a musical with terrible original songs that are spectical only and don't make you feel anything, south park did it better 23 years ago. The story is paper thin and gave away the ending with the trailer, typical Hollywood.

People say the ending is controversial but it's not really once you know how Todd felt after the success of the first. Todd makes sure it's painfully obvious he's giving you the complete opposite of what a fan would want from this movie and the ending is just the nails in the coffin.

At many points the ending included you think you're going to finally get some satisfaction and get what you came to see but no, the film is just subverting expections the movie. The ending is absolutely horrendous and literally ra**es the predecessor, I would of honestly preferred Arthur hit his head and woke up from a dream to then have the credits roll.

If you're a fan of the first avoid like the plague this is honestly one of the worst sequels ever made.

I hope it bombs and Todd Phillips's reputation never recovers.

He did a hangover 3 again, I hope he never makes another movie."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I felt completely mocked after watching this movie. It was a total waste of time, more like a Disney cartoon than a serious film. Instead of delivering the depth expected from a Joker movie, it felt more like a musical. It was a major letdown for Joker fans. They utterly dismantled the Joker character. The story was directionless and felt meaningless. Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem the terrible plot, but nothing ever did. It left me deeply disappointed.

The REAL JOKER character holds so much potential for deeper exploration. There are countless incredible films that could be made based on his complex life. Unfortunately, this film seemed more focused on profit, which led to its downfall. They reduced Joker to a filthy, pathetic man whose only hope lies in seeking sex and attention, and they dared to call that love. Seriously?!

That said, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding, particularly in certain scenes, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. At times, the music gave me goosebumps, just like in the first Joker movie, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience.

As for Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn, her costume didn't really capture the essence of the character. Her acting was decent, but nothing memorable or particularly special."
1.0,10 October 2024,"A movie that ignores DC-Comics fans, using the name of the Joker, the main character of the DC universe, to create something very different from what the director wanted it to be.

It is simply an insult to the franchise itself and to millions of DC-Comics fans. Apart from that, and although the actors are good, the movie does not have an attractive, involving story, bored, without development features good enough for viewers to want to see a sequel...

Movies are made to please as many audiences as possible and make money from them. But this movie has not pleased the majority, due to basic errors and will suffer the consequences in terms of money..."

2.0,15 October 2024,"And that's why those lazy writers (especially that Terrible Todd Philips and his God-Awful a-bit-too-much nudity for the Hangover films) should have left the first Joker 🃏 film alone, because they did Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) too dirty in this God-Awful sequel. I don't hate it because it's a musical. I understand why it's a musical, because Arthur and Lee Quintel were singing and dancing in their heads. Joaquin has an amazing singing voice. The voice time I heard him sing was when he played the legendary country singer Johnny Cash (Walk The Line). But still it's NOT why I hate it.

These are the reason why I hate that film so much:

1.) It's because of the scripts and story 2.) The writers did Arthur Fleck dirty by letting him get hurt and raped by the security guards 3.) Make Lee Quintel (Lady Gaga) broke up with Arthur just because he said ""There was NO Joker"", and that he was a lonely man who wanted to be nice & kind to others 4.) Make Arthur regret being the Joker 5.) Let an unnamed prisoner who was secretly watching Arthur and then psychopathally kill Arthur by stabbing him a million times through the stomach and let him bleed to death while carving his own smile in the background before Arthur was going to meet a visitor that we never saw who it was. It could've been either Lee Quintel

They definitely should have leave the first film alone. I prefer the first film way better than that God-Awful & Disturbed sequel. Hope it doesn't get nominated at the Golden Globes, SAG Awards, Critics Choice Awards nor Oscars (even though Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix Bob did a fantastic job. It wasn't even their fault.)

Joker (2019) Joaquin Phoenix will always be the best Joker film of all times, after Jared Leto and the late Heath Ledger (The Dark Knight)

I'd rather cast Joaquin and Gaga as different verison of Joker and Harley Quinn in Matt Reeves' Batman with Robert Pattison's Batman, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman, Paul Dano's The Ridder, Andy Serkis's Alfred Pennyworth, and Colin Ferrell's Penguin.

I really hope that this Godforsaken sequel has an assload of dislikes 👎🏽 because that ending was God-Awful.

I remember watching this with my co-worker thinking that it might be a good film, but Lord, was I wrong. I'm kind of glad those people behind us ruined the movie for me by leaving the lights for about 3 mins and talking on a phone silence for a minute, because I lost interested watching that God-Awful & disturbing sequel again. They shouldn't have made it in the first. There, I admit it. Should've leave the first film alone. The first film had a perfect ending, and they just had to do a sequel of it.

I'd rather cast Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as different versions of Joker and Harley Quinn in Matt Reeves' Batman with Robert Pattinson's Batman, Zoe Kravitz's Catwoman, Paul Dano's The Ridder, Andy Serkis's Alfred Pennyworth, and Colin Ferrell's Penguin.

I also really hope Margot Robbie comes back as Harley Quinn in the James Gunn's DCU in the future soon, and at least let Jared Leto play a different version of Joker 🃏 too. That's what I'd rather watch!

Also, I'm really glad that Bradley Cooper didn't come back to produce the God-Awful & disturbed 😳 sequel, because that s**t was awful, sad, depressed, nasty, and disturbed like the ending. The first one was wild enough."

10.0,5 October 2024,"This movie is such a dissapointment I had to sign up to write a review. I love the actors but what producers have done to the franchise is horrible ... This is disrespectful to the 1st with Joaquin, to Jared but mainly to Heath ... such a shame.

Cinema only 20% full and more than 10 people left half way through this disaster ... I don't get it, my kid doesn't get and I'm pissed I brought my son to see this disaster as he probably lost any interest in Joker as a character ... I know I have.

Whoever wrote this script, whoever decided to produce it: you should be ashamed of yourselves! To everyone else: don't loose time or money to see this nonsense."

2.0,5 October 2024,"Todd Phillips delivers once again with a captivating and intense motion picture. The film surpasses expectations, especially for a project that dives into the musical genre. Arthur Fleck's true essence is brought to life vividly. He's a complex character, timid yet insightful, as he understands the perspectives of both sides of the societal divide.

Lee Quinzel is an outstanding addition to the narrative. She begins as a seemingly typical female inmate but transforms as her obsession with ""The Joker"" deepens. Her pursuit of his affection is a key element of the story, injecting a playful yet unsettling energy into their grim world. The chemistry between them feels genuine and organic on screen until the tension mounts, leading to an unexpected climax.

Pros: Exceptional camera work and use of hand-held shots Meticulous lighting and color grading Stellar performances, particularly in how they elevate the narrative The immersive tone and atmosphere that capture the harsh realities the characters face A remarkable score and use of music, heightening the emotional weight of the film.

I find it disheartening to see this film receive such polarizing responses. Many critics group together in dismissal, inviting bandwagon negativity. To those who criticize this film, I hope you consider the immense effort required to craft a movie of this caliber. It's not always about the conventional ""plot."" That word has become overused. If a film can convey meaning and offer lessons, then it has succeeded as a piece of art.

Rating: 10/10 🃏"
3.0,6 October 2024,BORING. That's the only word I can use to describe this film. It was just a musical and was hugely disappointing from the big lead up from the first Joker. The film had no direction and objective just back and forth between two scenes of the prison and court house and we didn't see the crazy killing joker that we all craved all we got was a man that said he's not up for the job of being called the joker. It focused way too much on Harley I don't know if the directors were horny because it was Lady Gava or whatever her name is but her role was totally unnecessary and just because in real life she's a signer doesn't mean we need 30% of the movie to be signing! There's only one thing they could have done to make this film better and that's not release it at all.
4.0,4 October 2024,"I had high hopes for Joker: Folie à Deux, especially after the intense character development in the first film. However, this sequel is a massive letdown. Joker: Folie à Deux completely misses the mark. The film feels like it's going nowhere, lacking any meaningful development for Arthur Fleck. Instead of continuing his journey from the first film, the story seems to mock him with music, Lady Gaga. Then abandon him, offering no real growth or progression. The direction feels unclear, and the decision to effectively ""kill"" the protagonist's arc leaves the movie feeling hollow and unsatisfying. The decision to effectively ""kill"" the protagonist's arc feels like a lazy attempt at shock value rather than a well-thought-out narrative choice. Overall, it's a disappointing sequel that fails to build on the original's potential. Overall, it's a disappointing sequel that leaves the movie feeling hollow and unsatisfying."
10.0,13 October 2024,"Arthur Fleck is charged with four counts of first degree murder. At a music therapy session, Fleck meets Lee who he bonds with over their past. Fleck is soon found mentally competent to stand trial and he faces several familiar faces who come as witnesses. Meanwhile, Lee takes an interest in Fleck's Joker persona.

Let's start out with the positives. Joker: Folie à Deux features some lush cinematography and lively colors. I like how the colors go against the utter bleak tone this movie goes for. It also has some very creative shot composition that tells a lot about the characters. I love how one shot with Lee and Arthur together with Lee in the light and Arthur next to the fire. It truly is a dynamic shot showing how the two characters see each other. I also love the one take near the end of the film that is quite an impressive one to pull off. The costume design and makeup are both stellar too.

Some of the themes are very strong with the best one being about hurting the ones you care about. Arthur Fleck only targeted people who wronged him, but two people who were nice to him, Sophie and Gary, had their lives ruined despite being spared. I like how the movie goes into how the actions of a perpetrator affects the lives of others that they may care about in the worse way possible either traumatizing them or having the media blame them for one's issues. It also helps that Leigh Gill gives a heartwrenching performance in one of the most emotional scenes in the movie.

Joaquin Phoenix is sensational as both Arthur Fleck and Joker. Every single expression on his face tells everything we need to know about Arthur Fleck and how sad he is and how the Joker persona hides that. His line delivery is spot on too, especially during his speech with Gary. Phoenix shares great chemistry with Lady Gaga as Lee as they play off each other perfectly. Arthur Fleck as a character is an interesting case of how he became so broken and that no one really cared about his mental health in the slightest. Regardless of all the problems I have with this movie, Phoenix as Fleck is the highlight of the movie.

Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn or Lee is no slouch either. I was really excited for her portrayal as one of my favorite DC characters and although it is very different from what I am used to, I like how Lee symbolizes the audience who likes Fleck for his Joker persona and could care less about Fleck as himself. While some of Lady Gaga's line delivery can be a little stiff, she revels in her role as Lee and she has some fantastic expressions making her character a lot more complex than I thought she was. I have seen a lot of people say Lee was underutilized and while I wish she had more screen time, she does make a big impact on the story and Arthur's character. All that said...

Let me say this. I do not think it is a bad idea to make a movie that subverts audience expectations or even downright stomps on them. I think it is pretty cool that Todd Philips wanted to do something very unconventional for this movie. Joker: Folie à Deux is undeniably a very risky and daring big budget comic book movie unlike any other both in storytelling and with its genre. Unfortunately, it feels more like an over-stretched epilogue of a standalone movie than a solid sequel. It feels like Todd Philips did not have a lot of material aside from the court scenes so he used a lot of musical numbers to fill in the time. The pacing is far too slow, especially the third act which drags on way too long removing a lot of tension the movie could have. There are a lot of great ideas to explore here such as the trial becoming little more than a spectacle and conditional love, but they are either not done well, or underdeveloped.

Instead, the movie focuses on these flashy musical numbers which for the most part only happen in the heads of the characters. I did like the cover of Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley's ""The Joker"" that takes place in Arthur's head where he snaps in the court and attacks Harvey and the judge because of the lighting, choreography and the violent nature of it, but the rest of the covers are very underwhelming. There is not really any edge to them or flare. They look nice, but they do nothing for me aside from making me want to look up the original songs. Also, despite having Lady Gaga as one of the singers, the singing is not great. It's a shame too because I love the idea of bleak and depressing musical, but I just did not care for most of the songs here.

Although Phoenix and Gaga are great as Joker and Harley Quinn, the rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Catherine Keener does a great job as Arthur's empathetic lawyer, Bill Smitrovich is solid as the stern Judge Herman Rothway and Zazie Beetz and Leigh Gill give the most powerful moments in the film as Sophie and Gary respectively, but some of characters or performances are not great. Brendan Gleeson plays as quite possibly the biggest scumbag of a prison guard I have ever seen and he is downright unpleasant to watch. Gleason's performance is also overly cartoonish for this character and this is the kind of person I just want to see off my screen forever rather than hoping to see their comeuppance. I also was not crazy about Harry Lawtey as Harvey Dent. Lawtey did a fine job for what he is given, but Harvey feels like a generic prosecutor rather than the Harvey Dent I am familiar with.

Although there are some aspects and scenes I like about it, Joker: Folie à Deux is by far the most disappointing movie of the year. I really wanted to like this movie even after seeing the negative reception. Making a movie that goes against the first film is a very interesting idea that could have worked and the best scenes in the movie represent that. However, this movie feels like an epilogue that got stretched out as much as possible and I really feel that although Todd Philips is undeniably passionate and inspired with the direction of this movie, I feel that he ran out of ideas at some point. I appreciate the creativity and boldness here, but the movie as a whole just does not work.

That Looney Tunes inspired cartoon at the beginning was awesome though."
2.0,5 October 2024,"What can i say apart from such annoying singing the singing just kept on and on turning this film into a disaster!

It for sure is a musical and not a very good one as it was so irritating. Even though the character of joker was yet again played amazingly it just wasn't great at all This film literally could of been amazing an escape leading joker the the take over of gotham more gritty murders that's what i was waiting for but no just more singing i dnt get why this film let such a massive opportunity of success slip through there fingers there was no story line what so ever the film is based on JOKER yet we only seen a glimpse of him 😡😡"
5.0,15 October 2024,"To be frank, I'm shocked at the broader reactions to this movie, specifically the immovability and entrenchment of people's genre expectations. It's as if Phillips and Phoenix's first go wasn't grand evidence enough of their commitment to such an aggressively idiosyncratic creative interpretation of the Joker character. So fresh, so threatening, so deeply invested in 'post-pop' cultural expression, I loved that first film. But Folie a Deux is something else, a simply terrific work of cinematic art in every facet - performance, obviously (Gaga is also magnificent, as are the supporting cast), visual design, score and sound design (the blending of pop and jazz standard arrangements with Hildur Guodnadottir's powerful themes is thrilling), outstanding editing, and a narrative with themes that dare account for personality dysfunction/mental illness (via perfectly playing around with the 'musical' genre), in stark opposition to current societal dysfunction and celebrity culture pathology. Folie a Deux is a masterpiece, and I couldn't be more confident that the passing of time will credit it as such."
1.0,11 October 2024,"When the cartoon show opened the sequel showing Arthur The Joker impersonated by his shadow to take the stage and getting brutally thrashed by Police filling the screen with blood to show the title of the sequel, I got goosebumps. But, soon after the story revealed and it was actually looking freezed for adding literally nothing new to Joker, I got pissed. Lady Gaga is just a showpiece in this. No background story of her. What she tells to Arthur is also admitted as a lie by herself. Obviously, this movie that shows The Joker put in trial after the court should have a good argument from Prosecution & Defence. Sadly, this one fails too. Watch this only for Phoenix who has acted well, but provided with a story way below The Joker legacy. This sequel is like a coffin for that Masterpiece Original JOKER. I wish I had never seen this one as it took away the admiration I'd for JOKER to a great extent. If you want to try this, please leave any expectations based on the original. It is good for nothing."
4.0,5 October 2024,Entire movie was either in jail or in court. No action no suspense no thrill just lots of singing. Disappointing for sure. Expected to see more of the story developing into something else but no. There was lots and lots of conversation followed by a lil singing and then some more conversation then some more singing. I can understand why some might call this a musical. My girlfriend called it a musical at the end and said she didn't like it. If you like broadway and into the whole musical thing this might be the movie for you. Dont expect to get any action or even some thrilling suspense and definitely do not expect a good ending.
10.0,4 October 2024,"I went in to see this film with low expectations ... and it still managed to disappoint. The movie was far more yawn-inducing and boring than I could have imagined.

Joaquin Phoenix turns in an Oscar-worthy performance but still made me think of Heath Ledger's version. Sadly this whole movie was a massive folly. Single worst waste of my time in months. There is some good cinematography and lighting but there truly is nothing compelling in this to get more than 2/10 rating from me. The movie seemed to drag on and on in so many places I lost count. Even worse than dragging on this review to meet IMDB's contrived required minimum length for a review."
4.0,5 October 2024,"Joker Folie à Deux had great potential to live upto the standard of the first film. The first 20 minutes are great until he bursts into song for no reason.

Lady Gaga is great but it does turn into a bit of a Gaga concert at times and the film could have been made without her having to sing constantly.

The acting is brilliant from all main characters and it's nice to see characters from the first reappear.

I was, looking forward to seeing how the film ended I was disappointed by probably one of the most depressing endings that I've seen in cinema with no real outcome to the story.

5/10..........."
3.0,6 October 2024,"I'll start off harshly, just as the movie started harshly with us. It was a total disappointment, two hours of pure torment-two hours in which I kept asking myself if I was the one to blame for not understanding the mess on the screen, or if the writers and actors simply relied on the power of the name and figured it would work by itself.

A sick and utterly shameful movie. Nothing made sense in this film, from the sequence of events to the characters. At one point, the judge says he won't tolerate any circus in his courtroom, yet the entire movie was a circus.

They made this mess just for the final scene, where Joker is killed by the ""real"" Joker, hoping to pave the way for a third part. In my opinion, the third movie will likely be a romantic comedy, just to surprise us again.

I really hope that one day the director and actors will visit this site and read the reactions of the people in the cinema who are writing here, telling the absolute truth-how they truly feel.

In conclusion, this is a one-star movie because I can't give it any less!"

1.0,7 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring sequel that takes the chaotic brilliance of its predecessor and amplifies it with a musical twist. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film once again stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the tormented soul behind the Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel, better known as Harley Quinn12.

Set primarily in Arkham State Hospital, the film explores the deepening madness and twisted romance between Arthur and Harleen. The narrative is both haunting and mesmerizing, with Phoenix delivering a performance that is as intense and unsettling as ever. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is a revelation, bringing a raw and electrifying energy to the screen.

The musical elements are a bold choice, adding a surreal layer to the already complex psychological landscape. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, with Hildur Guðnadóttir's score perfectly complementing the dark and twisted narrative. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures the grim atmosphere of Arkham, making the hospital feel like a character in its own right.

While the film's pacing can be uneven at times, the performances and the audacious blend of genres make it a compelling watch. It's a film that challenges the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a deep dive into the psyche of its characters.

Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and unsettling sequel that will leave audiences both disturbed and enthralled. It's a must-watch for fans of the original and anyone interested in a unique cinematic experience."

I didn't read any reviews, I entered the movie theater with a completely open mind.. Worst part is I admire both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga and now I'm wondering why they agreed to this.. Don't you have any respect for your fans or what?? Who thought this was a good idea?? If you wanna capitalize on the success of your predecessor, at least try to make it somewhat interesting..Halfway through the movie I didn't really care anymore and I brought up my phone and started texting my girlfriend.. Yes, it was that boring..

Not impressed. Not for a second."
2.0,7 October 2024,"And here we......go. Over the past year, I have slowly been getting better at analyzing movies, digging deeper into their aspects. I've never been prouder of myself for JOKER: FOLIE Á DEUX, the sequel of 2019's JOKER (I still can't believe it's already been five years). The sheer amount of carefully placed details, man. Taking place two years after the events of the original - Spoiler warning for those who haven't seen the original! To those who haven't, why not? You gotta get on that. Anyway - Arthur Fleck A. K. A Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) has been locked up in Gotham City's Arkham Asylum. As he's waiting to face the consequences of his actions, he joins a singing program, where he meets Harley ""Lee"" Quinzel (Lady Gaga). His crazy matches her crazy. This is a character study at its finest. I've heard many people say there's no story here and it's hard to follow. The story is a character's path, and I had no problem following him. As the original had inspirations from TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY, this one is also full of throwbacks and homages to old-school movies and songs. Yes, if you haven't heard yet, this is a musical, just not in the traditional way. I'd call it a jukebox musical, with songs that fit in so perfectly I thought they were actually made up. I love how they mix reality with fantasy here, and focus on Arthur and Lee's relationship, as well as Joker and Harley's. This is not the ""clown prince of crime"" story that some people might be expecting. Don't expect Batman to pop up, it's 1983. The performances are expectedly amazing. Brendan Gleeson is always good, here as a prison guard. I knew this movie would be divisive. I had no idea how one-sided it would be. You could say it tests the audience, but director Todd Phillips wanted to tell a different story that explored a different side of a character we love to hate, taking a very bold swing. I highly recommend watching JOKER and JOKER: FOLIE Á DEUX on the same day; it actually feels like two halves of the same coin. I feel like the crazy one defending this, but JOKER: FOLIE Á DEUX is subversively phenomenal, at least to me. Anybody else?"

2.0,7 October 2024,"After the first great movie I had a really good feeling about this one. Joker and Harley got their own film finally, after the suicide squad small storyline I was really excited about it. Then after one hour in the cinema I started to feel like I'm on a different film, and this is some mistake, and I'm on a Disney-horror movie.

The biggest problem with this film is that it has had a lot of potential and never even try to catch one. I feel really sorry for Phoenix cause I know how much he wanted this movie. But sorry man, this is extremely cringe and just delete this one.

One good thing is that the music was great, I love Nick Cave!"
3.0,6 October 2024,"Horrible story, it destroyed completely what the joker is, the stronger villian from Batman universe.

Compared with the first part, this is a musical that not empower the Joker, does not shows how the Joker gain fame and power.

Instead to embrace his evil side and starts with his famous Joker band along with Harley Quinn, they show a weak Joker that is not smart and just improvises.

The end of the movie, is probably the worst, there was not connection between Harley and Joker and they tried to give a different end with another potential Joker, it didn't follow what the real story is. The musical was way too long and non sense."

4.0,6 October 2024,"As I read many of the reviews written for this film, I realise almost no one got the true message of the film. This is a film about Arthur Fleck mental illness and how society and media as a whole likes to present the spectacle of illnesses. This is presented straight away with the opening (SPOILERS animated sequence as the joker literally battles with himself for the spotlight.)

Arthur Fleck wanting to present his mental illness to the public and give what people like him have to go through lead to many of the high profile figures in the film to call his illness as fake, clearly conveying how society just wants to move away anything that causes a little problem instead of dealing with these issues in a just way. Society treats people like Arthur Fleck as second rate citizens who don't belong in society.

With this perception I urge you to watch this film and if you have, then give Joker: Folie à Deux another watch."

I mean, Lady GooGoo is kinda good at singing, but at acting? Noooooo, her acting is pretty mediocre! What if they had chosen another actress to play Harley Quinn who was not a singer?!? And make it into a second part like the first one: dark, gritty, dramatic and shocking??? But they choose to make this...a musical??? Having sooo little scenes that deserves your attention!

Poor Joachim Phoenix!! Again losing weight for this role..he is decent, but the storyline and all are just..from the first Joker movie..all are a huge letdown!! It's hilarious they didn't listen to people's first reactions long ago when news said it: ""Joker 2 it will be a musical"" and people's reactions were negative!! No one wanted this! No one ask for a musica!!! Nothing against musicals, but this time wasn't necesserly! Okay, few scenes of dancing and singing.. because yeah, we have two characters with some issues, but.. singing and singing and making this look like a.. opera show??? Naaaaahhh! Todd Phillips, what was in your mind?? How could you take this decision??? Well...i hope the movie will flop so you: studious, directors listening to the people and stop making awful decisions!!! WE REALLY DIDN'T WANT IT THIS TO BE A MUSICAL! WE didn't want a sequel at the first time but if you choose to make a sequel, at least keep the first movie track: dark, gritty, dramatic, shocking and original!!!"

3.0,3 October 2024,"This movie would be ok if it was just about a man with mental illness. There is no connection to joker or Harley Quinn. It's just a random mess with toooooo much singing. The first movie wasnt my favourite but it had more ""joker"" feeling. This was just so ...so... far fetched. I actually felt like walking out because the singing doesn't serve any purpose in story telling or setting the mood- it was boring and tedious.

And yes I get the whole psychological aspect but you can't just pick such an iconic character and whack it onto him. Acting of Joaquin is the only thing that made me sit through the whole movie.

And did I mention the singing was tedious..."
4.0,10 October 2024,"This is my top film of the year! It was fantastic, beautiful and so clever. The acting was phenomenonal, music was spot on. So many layers to this & anyone who felt unsatisfied by the film, this was the point. You're left feeling exactly how Arthur felt his whole life. Unsatisfied, unfulfilled and searching for something he'd never have! I felt a rollercoaster of emotions, I was laughing, crying, singing. This movie holds a mirror up to how society doesn't care about the broken, they just want the pain and suffering, and the Joke is on the audience which I think is genuis. I would have given it more stars if I could!"
8.0,4 October 2024,I went to watch a movie instead I had to watch a sequence of music videos which weren't even fun watching or pleasant to hear. I fell asleep thrice... The writer certainly missed to understand why the previous one was a super hit. Gaga was a disastrous choice for the character. She appeared nowhere close to Quinn. The film in general was a disapointment. There was no content at all. Very amature writing I'd say but commendable performance by Phoenix... Not against musicals but just that it wasn't meant for our protagonist.. sitting there in the theatre I imagined Heath Ledger performing those acts and my peace of mind was plundered.... They need to come up with a part 3 soon so that the horrors of this one is erased from my mind... Hopefully with a better writing..... Cheers.
4.0,4 October 2024,"This film is a bold and artistic portrayal of how a seemingly ordinary person's mental disorder surfaces through music. We are granted exclusive access to his inner world, with the film offering us a glimpse of what is truly going on in his mind. As viewers, we are the only ones privileged enough to enter this space.

What makes the experience even more fascinating is that he finds someone who can express her thoughts in the same way, through music. Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix were entirely believable in their roles. Their personal worlds came alive through the dialogue and music. It was a brilliant, immersive experience.

The cinematography was equally outstanding. Every shot seemed intentional, adding layers of depth to the story. The choices were daring and felt like an essential part of the narrative.

This film is a treat for film lovers, music enthusiasts, and anyone who appreciates art. A truly captivating moment of cinema!"
4.0,7 October 2024,"I don't have any statistics, but it is my hunch that the kind of audience that likes to watch dark and bloody thrillers don't like musicals. Conversely, I would be surprised if people who go to movies like ""La La Land"", would be willing to sit through a tough movie about a killer in prison. The first Joker movie was produced as though it was a Martin Scorsese film, and it was a revelation (see my review). The filmmakers back then had no intention of producing a sequel. While watching the sequel, I analyzed the story structure. Fleck is now in jail and is preparing for trial. That is not enough story to fill a two hour movie. Even with the introduction and pairing up of Joker and Harlequin in this movie, momentum is stunted while Fleck remains in prison.

For a more engaging story, all the events that happen later in this film should all be packed into the first act. The story I think audiences wanted was for Joker to break out of prison, begin his crime spree, and witness his transformation into the Joker we all know and love from ""The Dark Knight"".

I wonder if the director and screenwriter asked himself ""What would Marty Scorsese do?"". (I suppose he could call him and actually ask him). Well, Mr. Scorsese actually made a musical very early in his career called ""New York, New York"", with Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli. It is not considered one of his stronger works and thus I have never bothered to watch it. But I doubt there is any similarity to Joker 2. I believe when the filmmakers were tasked to make a sequel, another angle was sought to make it worth their while.

Hence, for the sake of adding more to the thin story, and to utilise a vehicle for their creative efforts, it became a musical. I don't like musicals. But I was unsure what my reaction would be to this strange mix of a film, so I gave it a chance. I can't help but bring up the Coppola movie ""Megalopolis"", which was released a couple weeks before this film. I was tossed about whether to see what was summarily declared a flawed film. Ultimately I decided to wait until video.

My decision to see this film, despite the warnings about it being a musical, came down to curiosity. Knowing I was willing to see it at least once, I chose to screen it in Imax. Trying not to follow critic reactions to the film, I nevertheless had to admit the musical angle didn't work for me. I don't like musicals. I will chalk it up to a failed experiment. The most poignant aspects of the Joker character in the world of Scorsese were encapsulated in the excellent first Joker movie. Here in the sequel, the aspects of his life in prison are underwhelming, and the real source of energy lay outside the prison walls.

As for Harlequin, she also was perhaps a little too normal. No real spark to her. Her character should have been extremely bi-polar, with mood swings that inspire appropriate set pieces. What I mean by 'appropriate' is that filmmakers carefully avoid the pitfalls of getting too goofy and removing us from the gravitas of the story. Instead in Joker 2, their courtship is very dull. Even the musical numbers are restrained, albeit with a bit of bravado.

There are some unexpected twists in the third act, but it takes too long to get there. However, it could very well be that time will change the attitudes toward this movie. I think of another Coppola movie, ""One from the Heart"". A very ordinary tale of a failing relationship set to music (but not a musical). It bombed when it opened, but later recognised as great filmmaking. So who am I to say what is at first an affront to audiences expecting a gritty thriller? It may spark its own subgenre and be lauded as great filmmaking.

Final thoughts: This sequel is successful in accomplishing the idea of expressing Fleck's fantasies as standard musical numbers, but it fails to put audiences under it's spell. I give a 4 out of 10."
4.0,6 October 2024,"What did I just watch ???

This is what happens when writers/director take public as a Fool, I guess, to accommodate Lady Gaga this is made Musical. Nothing happens in the movie, just panning camera on Joaquin Phoenix trying to win his second Oscar.

No story, Nothing ..... Just actors making fools out of themselves !!! Do not watch it, save your precious time....

Utter disappointment in the name of Cinema. Whoever gave that 4 stars on the Posters should be held accountable for wasting people's time & energy.

This film should be kept into that Secret Vault where people never could hear in their entire life. That will be good to Humanity."
3.0,4 October 2024,"While ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" undoubtedly boasts stunning visuals and powerful performances, the film falls flat in its execution. The decision to incorporate musical elements into the narrative feels forced and ultimately detracts from the story. The singing sequences, while visually impressive, serve little and fail to contribute anything meaningfull to the plot or character development.

Furthermore, the film seems almost intent on undermining the success of its predecessor. The exploration of how mental health is viewed by society in the first film which was so real-to-life that it caused many to fear that ""Joker"" would spark actual violence, was abandoned. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to distance themselves from the first film's realism and critical acclaim.

The real letdown, even to the point of frustration, is that the film could have been a powerful exploration of mental health and our society's morbid fascination with serial killers. It had the potential to build upon the themes introduced in the first film, creating a truly impactful sequel. Unfortunately, it fell short, opting for a predictable twist that many fans had already guessed in fan theories, before there was any plans for a sequel (which there weren't). It's a missed opportunity to delve deeper into such important topics.

The film's decision to stray from the gritty realism of the original ""Joker"" is a missed opportunity and leaves one wondering if the filmmakers were more interested in creating a spectacle than telling a meaningful story."

3.0,9 October 2024,"Because we were all under the same collective delusion that we were going to see the next evolution of The Joker film series - not a musical!

It was not advertised as, nor did I and 5 friends, go to see a musical. We all hated it. If I could ask for my money back I would. It is so far away from the real origins of the original Joker and associated films...shocking!

I can't remember the last time a film ended and the general vibe, from the audience, was so underwhelming. What were the scriptwriters and Directors thinking? They totally mishandled the stewardship of the franchise.

The lead actors are good - but there was so much depth that could have been unlocked by those actors with the right script. So, it was a wasted opportunity and an experiment, gone wrong.

If there is a 3rd film to the series - and I hope there is, then please make sure it returns to it's origins - instead of making another pantomime."
5.0,6 October 2024,"Really? This has to be some kind of joke? As a fan of the first movie, I am blown away at how this movie script was approved. To anyone with a half functioning brain with two synapses can see this was a horrible Idea for a sequel. I repeat A HORRIBLE IDEA . Its like they made the first movie, watched as the money poured in and thought. ""I'm going to make the sequel a complete antithesis to every theme of the first movie."" And we all know why it was done. Because the first movie was enjoyed by people the mainstream media deemed it to be ""dangerous"". This movie was made to please everyone that didn't approve of the first movie. Its made out of spite. Not a good movie."
5.0,4 October 2024,"You only see glimps of what we all loved from the first movie while constantly being interrupted by the musical scenes. Gaga's role could have been great too but yeah, no time for that will all the singing.

I liked the story that was told, how they paid homage to HL's Joker in the back of the police car scene and how it ended but all of the musical bits ruined the flow and immersion of the movie for me.

I just don't like musicals and if I would have known it was one, I wouldn't have gone to see it at the movies. I would have waiter to watch it at home.

This is my first actual written review on this site, hopefully I'll save some people from the experience I had."
4.0,4 October 2024,"*""Joker: Folie à Deux""* may claim to explore the dynamic between Arthur Fleck and Lee, but in reality, it's more of a one-man show. Lee's character, who could have provided a compelling counterbalance, is completely sidelined in the second half as the film descends into an oddly misplaced courtroom drama. Any potential for a rich exploration of their relationship evaporates as the focus shifts back to Arthur's repetitive internal conflict. The film flirts with the idea of duality-whether Arthur's Joker persona is distinct from him-but exhausts the question long before the credits roll.

The musical numbers are jarring and contribute little, with many sounding so similar that they only serve to drag the already sluggish narrative. They halt any momentum, leaving viewers unsure whether the film is a romance, a musical, a courtroom drama, or a critique of the justice system. In trying to be all of these things, it ends up being none, lacking any true sense of direction or purpose.

Lee's character could have added a fresh dynamic, but the script doesn't give her the space to develop. Instead, she fades into the background, almost as an afterthought. By the end of its bloated runtime, the film leaves viewers questioning why it exists at all. Was it born from the massive success of the 2019 *Joker*? Possibly. But if that's the case, this film takes every opportunity to squander that goodwill.

A cast of incredibly talented actors, visually stunning set designs, and an atmospheric score are wasted in a story that has little to say. Todd Phillips seems determined to dismantle everything that made the original Joker compelling, leaving audiences wondering if this sequel's purpose was merely to prove that lightning doesn't strike the same place twice."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Yaar bilkul mazaa nahi aaya (didnt enjoy at all)

They could have done sooo much more soo much more with the character and could have used the Arkham Asylum break arc from the comics/anime/suicide Squad

Lady Gaga was massively under-utilised... her singing numbers had to hit a better punch

Joaquin - bhai was awesome i have to say I sat through it just to see him play the character so meticulously

Script is NON EXISTENT!

They made the character really confused... randomly things happen without any built up

Personally was looking forward to this movie for the last 5 yrs! Kitna kuch kar sakte the hum yahan."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a 2024 psychological drama sequel starring Joaquin Phoenix returning to the role as Arthur Fleck who is trying to prove himself as a good person while put in court, along the way he meets his true love Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) in the asylum he's currently put in. As their love for eachother bloom, the chaos around him builds and builds to the point of pure calamity in this heartbreaking tale of mental illness, love and divisiveness.

I'm just gonna say this, THE FILM IS NOT A MUSICAL and while it has a lot of singing in it, it uses the musical numbers to bring a dramatic impact to the story and a escapism for Arthur in general. Of course the music is not perfect, but it doesn't need to be as the somber tone really blends well with the music and honestly, it's just so beautiful! The acting, oh my god Joaquin Phoenix has never shined so brightly in a role really convincing and more than accurate portrayal of a man in pain throughout the runtime (which is so heartbreaking and hard to watch). Lady Gaga also shares this connection and bond with Phoenix that I can't describe without crossing spoiler territory but it's honestly so deep and tragic what these broken people will do for eachother.

As the story goes, it's nothing what I was expecting and most of the audience for that matter, some scenes just appear and they're so unexpected and somber and just flat out insane to witness on screen. The acting duo play their presence onscreen like a game of tennis, whacking back and forth the ball with eachother and that's something truly impressive to convey well in a great story. I've seen films that deliver a long lasting affect after the credits roll, but this one just punched me in the gut and the message of mental health being put on at the same time it just really took my breath away.

Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux does wonders and deliver impact to screen in a way that I haven't seen in a long time, part court thriller, part romance and part drama tied with a bitter sweet ending done in a poetic manner that does not tug the heartstrings, it rips them off!

Combined that with kind of this Bonnie and Clyde formula of love and sweet taste of fantasies really cheered me up and I know film crew don't really read reviews but whoever was involved in this project, give yourself a pat on the back because you really made me smile like Joker does!

Grade: A+"
4.0,4 October 2024,"I am incredibly disappointed with Joker: Folie à Deux, especially with the decision to turn it into a musical. What were they thinking? The first Joker movie was a masterpiece, praised for its dark, gritty tone and Joaquin Phoenix's brilliant performance. But now, five years later, they return with this... and it's a musical? I struggle to understand the logic behind it.

After also seeing Joaquin Phoenix in Napoleon, where Ridley Scott's direction fell short, I'm left wondering why two great films with such a phenomenal actor can fail so miserably. Phoenix remains a class act, but the films themselves are hugely underwhelming. We've been waiting for this Joker sequel for five years, only to be met with a baffling, disappointing result.

A massive letdown!"
4.0,6 October 2024,"Like many others I was looking forward to seeing Folie a Deux, the promo images and other teasers over the past year have intrigued me and yeah I was excited to learn Lady Gaga would portray Harley Quinn, it was a casting decision that seemed to make sense.

Amazing performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, they really did give it their all. Visually striking scenes and imagery that felt iconic in parts but there was next to no storyline, I was bored. I can see what the filmmakers were trying to achieve but the idea of storytelling through musical numbers is just too far removed from the original film's style to keep those who loved Joker on board. Shame."
4.0,9 October 2024,
9.0,3 October 2024,"I went to see this in the cinema today with some friends. I hadn't looked into it at all but saw the first one and am a fan of both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady GaGa so I expected to really like it.

I figured, based on the previous movie, that it wasn't going to have a lot of explosions or action, but I expected a good plot line and psychological drama.

However, it was a sub-standard musical where the plot all but disappeared into obscurity.

Joaquin Phoenix is not a strong singer and I strongly suspect that they asked Lady Gaga to tone down her abilities to not overshadow his performance.

The entire movie droned on and on and on. It was so slow that there were times I almost dozed off."
5.0,6 October 2024,"Dc could have done something amazing with ol joker but insted they went with a dreary deep portrayal into the depths of his insanity. In this second snore fest they have taken a musical turn thanks to ms gaga playing harley quin just to add to the cop out of any action or sfx that dc and village roadshow decided was best for the joker character.

The joker could have been a thrilling ride alongside a psycho as he created the joker empire that's repeatedly depicted with the joker in other appearances. The joker could have been a action packed massacre with jaw dropping monologues that delve into the psychiatry whilst the over blown action portrays an unhinged menace that rose the batman. That unhinged psychotic character was how I felt about the Heath ledger batman that I wished there was more of in these joker movies.

I did not enjoy these joker movies. I hate it when action studios decide to create portrayals of psychiatry, in my mind instead of spending millions on overblown action they have copped out with long scenes of context that get dreary."
4.0,3 October 2024,
3.0,4 October 2024,"Watched the second ""Joker"" film, which for the most part I actually connected with more than the empty and overrated first, but there's a similar lack of story and it ends even more pointlessly. It doesn't GO anywhere: in this film, even more than the first, the Joker starts and ends a passive, weak, action-less nonentity, devoid of any talent or inspiration, carried along entirely in the wake of others, and hence has no connection to the Batman villain character in any way.

Folie à Deux could have redeemed itself if it had advanced the story from the first and unambiguously showed him transformed (by love?) into a supervillain of some kind by the end, surrounded by Harley Quinn and a gang of his imitators, but the very opposite occurs, so it's a waste of both characters and the chance to tell any kind of a story whatsoever.

The musical numbers add almost nothing and stop the flow of the film each time they appear. Plus, the whole thing's so needlessly drawn-out, the full experience feels like drowning in molasses.

All Hollywood does these days is insult and assassinate our heroes and villains of the past, and this is ultimately just another annoying and depressing degradation of a great icon and a squandering of the talents and attention of everyone involved."
4.0,14 October 2024,"I was a big fan of the original joker because of its unique script and acting by Joaquin Phoenix.

However, this joker 2 as a musical is a phenomenal attempt but a huge flop trying to incorporate a musical into this schizophrenic personality

unfortunately it just diverts into so many boring segments that it's no longer even entertaining and feels more like a bunch of musical skits that represent his fantasy world/ mind yet it has no cohesive connection or storyline that pulls in the audience and becomes repetitive and tedious to the point of exhaustion like the editor and director were incapable of cutting out so much unnecessary content.

It easily could have been 30 -45 mins shorter and there was way too many unnecessary musical scenes that by the time the 3rd act Arthur stops Harlequin from singing and you almost are laughing because even Arthur is tired of the charade - and by then most of the audience has left the theatre also.

If the director aim is to create a bizarre dull movie then it is a huge success that few might enjoy so go in with super low expectations

The acting is fine by both leads but the story is so uneven and dull it feels like a bad trip that the director thought would be entertaining but it's a flop.

Most of the audience walked out of the theatre by the time the lame ending came to fruition - and it was not worth the ride.

The only positive is that there will not be a sequel

3 stars for the set pieces and DP and costume work but only a 1 for directing/ writing."
4.0,2 October 2024,"After the masterpiece that the first Joker film was, I waited for the sequel to be even more amazing-especially with the intriguing subtitle, Folie à Deux, hinting at a deep dive into the shared madness between two characters. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a film that left me feeling profoundly underwhelmed.

Yes, the acting is undeniably strong. Joaquin Phoenix continues to deliver his methodical, unsettling portrayal of Arthur Fleck, and Lady Gaga shows real potential as Harley Quinn. Both actors gave it their all, but the material they were working with left much to be desired. The script gave them little room to explore the complexity of their characters. In contrast to the first Joker-a dark psychological thriller that masterfully peeled back the layers of Fleck's mind-the sequel felt hollow, relying more on style than substance.

The decision to make Joker: Folie à Deux a musical was certainly not the best choice. In theory, I can understand wanting to inject something new into the sequel to avoid being a carbon copy of the original, but the genre shift felt really out of place considering how Joker was lauded for its haunting, psychological approach to topics like mental illness and societal breakdown.

Lady Gaga, was clearly cast to showcase her acting chops, not just her vocal skills. So why lean so heavily into the singing? It felt as though the filmmakers were more interested in creating an extravagant showcase for her musical abilities than allowing her to fully inhabit the darker, twisted persona of Harley Quinn. Her acting moments showed promise, but the movie never gave her the space to explore her character in a way that felt authentic or emotionally resonant.

In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a missed opportunity. It lacks the raw, nerve-wracking intensity of its predecessor and tries to compensate with flashy musical numbers and surreal set-pieces. But beneath that glittery surface, there's not much to hold on to. The psychological depth that made the original Joker such a profound and unsettling experience is largely absent here, replaced by spectacle."
8.0,2 October 2024,"Joker 1 was Oscar-worthy, that film truly deserved the Oscar.

This one was a cheap musical where Lady Gaga stood out with her voice.

Joker was a sedated prisoner with a dual personality that wasn't very evident, it was mostly uncertain.

Everything takes place in Arkham and the courtroom, very static.

It also contains some psychological scenes, but if you're not into psychology, they seem like ordinary and boring sequences.

The ending is sad and psychological, leaving you with a few questions.

Overall, I don't think it will surpass the first film in any way; it only overshadows it.

Overall, I'd rate this film a 5."
4.0,3 October 2024,"Unlike Joker's 1st part the sequel doesn't add much to the storyline. Joaquin phoenix & Lady gaga performed their characters really well.

The musical element in the movie was fine but doesn't feel required. There was not much scope for the background score in the movie as it has very slow pace & filmed like a prison or courtroom drama.

Despite having shown very limited locations in the movie the cinematography is really good. This movie has similar dark tone as the previous one which looks good.

This sequel tries to show the aftermath of the incidents that took place in the first movie but the storyline doesn't do justice. It would be better if this story was shown in a webseries instead of a movie."
5.0,7 October 2024,"Anyone who says they didn't like the movie, they simply lacked the media literacy to understand it. ""The movie is a musical"" yes because we are watching a mentally ill person battle, with song and dance as his defense mechanism. Anyone who paid attention to the first Joker knows that already. The movies aren't made just for you to have fun watching them. They are made to make you think. In Ancient Greece a theatre play was called ""didaskalia"" meaning ""teaching"". Every director that makes a movie as meaningful as (this) Joker wants to teach you something. Stop searching only for gunshots and blood in film and open your eyes to truly watch. Do better."
2.0,3 October 2024,"Joker Folie a Deux had the potential to be an astonishing film, but the writing just wasn't there.

Watching the movie felt like a roller coaster of building up suspense and a sort of hope, to then delve into either an unfitting song or a boring sequence of events. At times it looked like the story could go in the direction of exploring Joker/Arthurs psyche, to then suddenly turn the focus onto Gaga's character or another unfitting song. Other times the story would look like it was going towards Joker and Harley having the comic book relationship many would've liked to see (done better than suicide squad) on the big screen, to again ripping it out from under the audience. From the outside it seemed like the writers just wanted to write a surreal, whimsical musical, and forgot to have an actual fulfilling story.

All in all, the movie had loads of beautiful cinematogrophy done by Lawrence Sher, the usual impressive acting by phoenix, and a surprisingly good performance by Lady Gaga. But the story lacked a direction and a theme. Overall disappointing movie after how good the first one was."
5.0,5 October 2024,
5.0,7 October 2024,"I really wanted this movie to be as good as the first film but my expectations for this film failed. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga do give out Oscar worthy performances for their roles. But unfortunately the film falls flat with the main story,pacing,writing, the musical numbers, the courtroom sequence and the ending of the film.

I think the film started off on a really good note but fell flat an hour into the film.

This did not feel like a DC film but instead just slapped some Batman character names into the film and called it a DC film.

I'm giving this a 4/10 The film did not need to be made at all and probably had the most controversial ending of the year. Joker (2019) should've been a one and done movie. Joker Folie À Deux did not do the first film justice."
9.0,3 October 2024,"Remember the great first movie? Yea scratch that we're making a bad crime based lalaland that's way worse in every way. And how you ask? We take the development of the main character made during the first movie and trash it, reverse it until nothing is left and finished with a unglamorous ending as insignificant as the character's impact in this movie. Honestly if I want to watch a musical I'll watch lalaland or Barbie or go to theatre. But this is just such a huge step backwards from the first movie that it's really not even worth paying for the cinema to see it. It's not an understatement to say biggest cinema disappointment of the year."
4.0,4 October 2024,"A Love Letter to the Fans: A Masterful Conclusion

Todd Phillips' latest film feels like a heartfelt love letter to all the true fans of the Joker. It masterfully answers long-standing questions, takes you on an emotional rollercoaster that will make you both laugh and cry, and ultimately delivers what the audience has been craving: a worthy sequel.

From the beginning, it felt unfair that Batman got so many stories while the Joker only had one chance to shine. This film corrects that imbalance, offering a final, twisted bow from the Clown Prince of Crime-a fitting end for those who truly understand the depth of his character.

Phillips weaves together a journey that is as thrilling as it is thought-provoking, offering a twist that ties everything together beautifully. It's not just a sequel; it's a tribute to one of the most iconic villains in cinema, and it will leave a lasting impression on those who get it. What a journey!"
5.0,4 October 2024,"Some viewers were upset that Joker (2019) borrowed too heavily from Taxi Driver (1976). This was very similar to fan complaints of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) being too much like Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). So, for the second installment in that series, Rian Johnson made some bold and divisive choices. The difference between the choices made by Johnson then, and Todd Phillips now, is that the choices Johnson made had legs. Whether you liked The Last Jedi (2017) or not you can admit that the movie had bold ideas, but these ideas were also interesting. The same can not be said for Joker Folie a Deux.

Making a super villain movie a musical is indeed a bold move, however, nothing was done to make it an interesting move/movie. For it to be a strong idea, the musical elements of the film have to land or at least be memorable. Cycling through the Best of the 50s and 60s isn't a bold musical choice. If you're going to go full musical, which this is, put some time into making original songs.

Remove all the music from Folie a Deux and what do you have? A two hour slog split between Arkham Asylum and the courtoom. The few moments where Joaquin Phoenix is allowed to cook (doing a Foghorn Leghorn voice in court) are some of the few bright spots in the film. Otherwise, this was an ambitious undertaking that isn't even interesting enough to be polarizing."
4.0,7 October 2024,"There was no story. There is literally no story in the movie.

It was a musical mess that deviated from the original first movie.

The performances from Gaga and Phoenix are the only highlight of the movie. With whatever little script, they manage to bring the best out of the roles.

The movie seems completely pointless other than a straight up money grab. The plot and the setting is average at best.

After the masterpiece of the first movie, the expectations were high but it all falls flat. Whoever decided to proceed with the half-baked musical plot that makes no sense whatsoever should be held accountable.

Sadly, this is the reality of most DC movies today."

And it's one of the very few movies in total I didn't watch until the end. Why? Every scene has musical part which brings exectly nothing to the movie. How is this nonsense singing connected to Arthur's characters anyway? Looks like someone demanded the sequel and this is what we get - just another money-grab movie we didn't want or need. I could not even enjoy the spectacular performance of Joaquin, which is the only thing why I didn't give this a 1 star. How can the first Joker and this abomination be the product of same authors?"

The essence of the Joker as a fearless, unpredictable, and chaotic villain was completely missing. Instead, the character portrayed seemed weak and hesitant, which doesn't align with what makes the Joker such a compelling figure. It felt like the director either misunderstood the character or simply wasn't interested in bringing the true Joker to life. If that was the case, it makes me wonder, why did the director choose to take on the project in the first place? If he wasn't willing or able to capture the true essence of the character, what was the point? The whole experience felt like a missed opportunity, and as a fan of the Joker, it was honestly disappointing."
4.0,7 October 2024,"I don't usually write reviews, but with this I had no choice. Let me start by saying the acting was top notch. What were the writers thinking to go so far away from a winning formula in part one. Why would you do that after it worked so well the first time. I must admit I felt short changed after watching it tonight. Why would you make it into a musical?

The writers need changing if they can't come up with anything better than that. Loved the first film. , even the Gary Giltter song with Arthur is coming down the stairs worked brilliantly. All in all very disappointing apart from the acting which is such a shame when you start by having a massive franchise to work with."
1.0,4 October 2024,"I'll come right out and say it. I wasn't a fan of the first movie, I thought it got a lot of hype that it didn't deserve. But I could understand why people enjoyed it (not counting all the incels who base their entire personality on the movie).

But this movie..it's hard to like. Even with Lady Gaga putting in a pretty admirable performance. Joker goes from a character who is down on his luck and society has painted him in the corner, to just completely unredeemable in every way. Worst of all, the movie is boring. You take a character like Joker and you put him one of the most boring settings, a courtroom, and that's where most of the major scenes take place! Where's the unpredictability? Where is Fleck interacting with the world that he created? Sowing the seeds of chaos that he planted in the first movie? DC continues to prove that they have no clue what to do with this character. And it's disappointing to say the least. You're better off watching Batman the Animated Series reruns and the Dark Knight at least that Joker is menacing and a credible threat. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Really disappointing, a sort of musical rather than film; few jokes, too many songs and useless scenes thrown away as filler. The characters are flat, empty even if the quality of the actors is obscured by a monotonous and insipid plot. I expected something much better, well I was disappointed (already the first film ABSOLUTELY did not respect the original story, but at least it had a bit of suspense, this time not even that...) If you have two hours of free time and love Broadway, give it a try but I warn you: halfway through the movie I gave up hope (I only finished it because I had paid for the movie ticket).

Sometimes the reputation of a title is worth more than its quality."

3.0,6 October 2024,"I understand that many people didn't expect that from the film, but I don't think it was a bargain. I waited 5 years for it, I can understand if someone idealised it, but I don't think it deserves that much hate. The cinematography is beautiful, and really really magical, the music is very good, Hildur Guðnadóttir is up to the mark again, and Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant again. And Lady Gaga is enough for the movie, luckily she doesn't have too much screentime (she was quite good but not the best Harley I think). I think it's a good film, I don't feel particularly lacking, it was worth the wait."
4.0,6 October 2024,"A showcase of Joaquin's talent no doubt. His performance mixes subtlety and overblown grandeur to great effect. The film continues the originals commentary on mental illness and how badly supported sufferers are. It is of course a fictional tale, but there are plenty of reasons to ponder how close the fiction matches the facts of inadequate social care and mental health funding in real life. The movie is dark, no bundle of laughs that's for sure. The biggest bugbear has to be that I remain unconvinced that musical standards present the best opportunity to tell that particular story! 5/10 for the movie. 10/10 for JP!"
4.0,5 October 2024,"I feel conflicted about Joker: Folie à Deux. As someone who loved the first Joker, I went into the sequel with some concerns, especially after hearing mixed reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm still processing how I feel.

I'll start with the musical aspect. I'm not a fan of musicals, and while this movie didn't change my opinion, it didn't bother me as much as I expected. The musical numbers felt integrated into the story, but they didn't elevate the experience for me either. And there weren't as many musical moments as I feared.

Visually, Folie à Deux is just as stunning as the first movie. Todd Phillips once again proves he knows how to create beautiful, immersive sets and craft visually memorable scenes. The film's aesthetic is one of its strongest elements.

Joaquin Phoenix remains fantastic as Arthur Fleck. His performance continues to be a highlight, and even though I didn't love certain aspects of the story, he fully embodies the character once again. However, one thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Arthur's character arc didn't feel like it moved forward. Instead, the film seemed more focused on giving us a retrospective look at Arthur, almost trying to reverse or undermine the progress of his journey from the first movie. Maybe trying to hard to antagonize certain aspects of the audience who really liked the first one.

Then there's Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. While she's undoubtedly talented and adds to the plot, her character felt underutilized and a bit forgettable. She has the voice for the musical moments, but Harley herself isn't fully fleshed out, which left me wanting more from her portrayal.

The film's ending also left me a bit infuriated. I personally think the movie would have been better if it had ended about 10 minutes earlier. The ending we got really made the first two hours seem rather pointless.

Overall, Folie à Deux isn't as bad as some people say, but the first movie is miles ahead of this one. It is thought-provoking, and either way, whether you thought it was good or bad, you will be passionate about your feelings about it. But the sequel didn't capture the same magic, and by the end, I think it would have been better if Joker hadn't gotten a second movie at all."
4.0,4 October 2024,"The newest Joker movie falls flat compared to its predecessor. What was once a gripping, character-driven narrative has now turned into a mindless cash grab, losing the psychological depth that made the original special. The musical numbers feel out of place, as if they're only there to distract from the fact that this sequel lacks direction and purpose. The singing doesn't add to the plot or the character's complexity-it merely pads out an empty script. Instead of expanding on the story, it diminishes the impact of the original, turning a thought-provoking film into an uninspired spectacle. Enjoy at your own risk."
1.0,6 October 2024,"There is actually a good movie in there somewhere but Why did they have to cut away 15 times to stupid ensembles that contributed nothing to the movie, it was nothing but an unwelcome distraction. Was there not enough time to write the script so they had to fill it with songs?

Parts of the movie were enjoyable with some sort of resemblance to what made the first movie so popular. However everytime I began to enjoy it another song popped up and by the end of the movie it actually began to feel like torture. It gets a 5 out of 10 for the small bits of the movie we did get to see. Hopefully a version gets released without the cutaway to annoying singing scenes, even if it will only be about 45mins long."
8.0,4 October 2024,"Lawrence Sher deserves huge credits for his amazing camera work. I hope he gets more offers for a more grateful script than this garbage of a movie. I felt bad for him to work here. Hopefully he got his bag cause he's not the one to blame for this mess.

Todd Phillips you created a masterpiece in 2019 and sabotaged it on purpose. You got your pay check and could've at least tried to make a good sequel like a Joker & Harley Bonnie & Clyde movie or something. Joker 2 has no story, no development and gives me nothing for my money. It's one thing to punish Warner, but a horrible thing to do that to the people that actually pays for that. Warner still gets money for that so it makes no sense to f up this movie. I trusted you because of Old School, War Dogs & Joker, but this sequel puts DC's most popular character in the absolute worst spotlight ever and I'll never forgave you for that. Unlike others I don't think the musical aspect was an issue although it haltered the movie and overstretched it to find its pace.

Joaquin Phoenix

Hit and miss actor. Fabulous work in the first movie and the only thing I can here blame him for is saying yes to this terrible movie.

Lady Gaga She's not a good actress for me, but she really tried and was pushing to get something out of this movie. Her character was written off bad as it started.

Shame on all of the people who thought it's a great pitch and idea to record in the first place. You all feed the cliche of Hollywood destroying classics.

The 3/10 goes out to the camerawork and for all the actors."
2.0,5 October 2024,"The second Joker film is not the dumpster fire that everyone is trying to paint it to be. I was a film critic for years; I could regale you with an articulate critique, highlighting the films best qualities and glossing its few issues. Praising the vision of the director and the dynamic performances of the enigmatic leading actors. Present how the idea of the unreliable narrator continues to work in all the best ways possible. However, I will save the rhetoric, because the most important opinion is your own: So go form one. If you enjoyed Joker, I have no doubt you will see the merits of Joker: Folie a Deux. Now go have some fun at the movies."
3.0,6 October 2024,"Not even close to the first Joker. The acting is cheesy. The songs are all lovey and cringy. We walked out of the theartre about halfway in. Alls they seem to do is stand around and smoke cigarettes. I had high hopes despite it being a musical. Very disappointed. Joker one is still my favorite comic book based movie, and as far as I'm concerned it's a stand alone movie. Absolutely butchered what could have been another amazing movie.

Another potentially amazing movie destroyed by wokism. Why in the hell would they make it a musical?? The cartoon at the beginning was a dead giveaway that it was going to be terrible. Would have got my money back 8f we could have."
2.0,7 October 2024,"Joker Folie À Deux is a bold and ambitious sequel and I really respect just how creative this film is. Just like the first movie Todd Phillips killed it in the directors chair and the cinematography is the most beautiful I've seen all year. Joaquin Phoenix returns to play Joker and he does a great job. I also really like Joker's character arc in this film of coming to terms with who he is compared to who he wants to be. Lady Gaga brought her phenomenal acting chops to her portrayal of Harley Quinn and she did a great job with what she was given. However she wasn't really given all that much. This version of Harley Quinn was inconsistently written and underdeveloped. Her motivation makes less sense as the movie goes on and the character really is Harley Quinn in name only. She doesn't really act anything like the Harley Quinn we have grown to know and love over the years. This brings me to my problems with the script in general. This is a movie that hits you over the head with what it's trying to say. This is a film all about Arthur Fleck growing as a person and trying to be more than the Joker persona that he used to start a movement. There is definitely some interesting social commentary but all the slow burn subtlety from the first film is thrown out and exchanged for loud and obnoxious messaging that feels like a script trying to check boxes and not a natural story. This is frustratingly obvious with the ending of the movie where one of Joker's followers feels betrayed and stabs him to death. I also don't understand why Harley Quinn didn't just kill Joker instead of that random guy. It would've felt more natural and personal while still representing what that message was supposed to be. The movie's pacing also feels off. I think a lot of that has to do with the musical numbers which just feel kind of pointless and unnecessary. Since the musical numbers don't add much of anything to the story they just make the movie drag. The music isn't very memorable or interesting which doesn't help either. However the musical set pieces look great. The production design is great all around, and same goes for the makeup. The costumes are hit or miss for me personally. The costumes during the musical sequences are pretty cool but most of Joker and Harley's outfits are kind of bland, especially the more modern take on Harley's red and black outfit. Overall this is a well made movie from most aspects of film making. While I don't think it deserves the immense hatred that it's getting it definitely has problems. The movie is focused on a messy script and the clunky pacing just highlights how messy it is. The fact that the first movie is so much better also hurts this movie a bit too."

5.0,6 October 2024,"The movie isn't just about the infamous villain-it's a deep psychological study of the fragility of the human mind when pushed to its limits. Even though I'm not a fan of musical films, this one hit me differently. The way it illustrated the perception of reality through a mentally unstable lens was phenomenal. Kudos to the filmmakers for their thoughtful, nuanced approach, pulling viewers into the distorted psyche of the Joker. The film explores mental health in a hauntingly relatable way, leaving a lasting impact.

The creators deserve significant praise for how meticulously they depicted the Joker's unraveling mind. Each scene felt carefully crafted to pull us deeper into his world, making us question what was real. The musical elements, which I typically wouldn't enjoy, added emotional depth without feeling out of place. It balanced the surrealism of Joker's internal chaos with the grim reality he faced.

The performances, especially by the lead actor, were incredible. His portrayal captured the fine line between vulnerability and volatility. Supporting characters enhanced the story, creating a world that felt both familiar and unsettling. The musical sequences added dreamlike moments that contrasted with the heavy themes, helping to elevate the emotional intensity.

Ultimately, this film challenges traditional storytelling and genre boundaries. It's a must-watch for those interested in films that provoke deep thought and leave an emotional mark."
2.0,4 October 2024,Away from the original 50% of the time the movie invests in becoming a musical to express how the mind of Arthur Fleck works troughtout the film. Not worth paying to see unless you really want to torture yourself into seeing beauty in artistic depressive and not truthful to the first movie messed writting with Lady Gaga and Phoenix giving their best to not make this a total mess. The movie crew and the actors really did an amazing job and its out of respect for them I would not rate this lower but would feel dishonest to give a higher rating. Some people left the theater still in the middle and nobody stayed waiting for a post credit scene if there is any...its so unamused that havent even looked for it.
1.0,5 October 2024,"I was in the minority of people who were really excited for a musical. I enjoy camp movies and I think there could be a lot of artistic merit and show of talent within non traditional cinema storytelling. E.g. Lighthouse, Poor Things.

So a Joker and Harley musical sounded like a lot of fun. Especially since they can incorporate a lot of compatible elements like their quirkiness, physical and wit based comedy, their showmanship, their violence, and the overall over the top Gotham aesthetic that can be found in a lot of DC media/comics. And Harley will also be played by a great singer who does a lot of over the top performances. It must at least be somewhat good.

Instead it was so boring, and miserable. It was self indulgent bleakness that was pointless in every possible way. It should be impossible to make a Joker and Harley musical this excruciatingly dull. And yet they achieved it. And I watch a lot of miserable movies (I liked A Serbian Film), at least those movies remember that there should still be an element of fun. It's like they wanted the movie to be unwatchable.

I do have a lot of other issues with the movie but i expected or at least can deal with those issues. The making of a movie that should be by definition at least an ounce of fun instead be the equivalent of watching paint dry is what killed me."
2.0,3 October 2024,"*Please stop singing* - Joker whispers pleadingly at one point, summarising the audience thoughts. (one of the few times where I actually heard a reaction from my fully packed auditorium)

When Joker (2019) was released, it shocked audiences and critics alike, becoming a box office phenomenon, grossing over a billion dollars and earning widespread acclaim. A bold gritty, raw, and subversive experience that heavily borrowed from cinematic masterpieces like Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, while weaving in elements from Fight Club. These influences were evident, but ultimately, no one cared that the film wasn't entirely original because it was still brilliant in execution. Todd Phillips crafted a grim character study of Arthur Fleck, anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's transformative performance. It became a near-instant classic, defining what a modern psychological thriller could be within a comic book framework.

Now, five years later, Joker: Folie à Deux tries to recapture that magic - and fails. Spectacularly.

Phillips, this time, ventures further into his own vision, no longer leaning on the established classics that shaped the first film. The result? A disjointed, unfocused sequel that tries to be many things but masters none. The film attempts to blend multiple genres, from courtroom drama to psychological thriller to musical, yet never fully commits to any of them. Each element feels like a half-measure, teasing an interesting direction before abandoning it entirely. The end product is a film that has no clear narrative thread or identity.

The most baffling creative choice was to mak Folie à Deux a musical. It's not inherently a bad idea - musicals can offer powerful commentary and depth when done well. However, here the songs feel awkwardly shoehorned into scenes, interrupting the already meandering plot. The musical numbers don't blend seamlessly with the story or add emotional weight; instead, they become unnecessary distractions rather than a hoped deeper exploration of the Joker's psyche. There's no clear reason why the Film needed to be a quasi-musical other than to stretch the thin story. Without these showpieces the film would be significantly shorter and its hollowness more obvious.

Joaquin Phoenix's return as the Joker, while highly anticipated, is underwhelming. In the first film, his portrayal of Arthur Fleck was raw, disturbing, and compelling - a character study of a man unraveling. In the sequel, however, his character lacks the same depth and nuance. The film rehashes many of the same emotional beats and traumas from the first movie, offering little in terms of new insight. There are even flashbacks and redundant references to the events of the previous film, as if Phillips wasn't sure what direction to take and decided to lean heavily on past glories. Phoenix's delivers a strong performance but it's not as compelling as the first time. It felt kind of dispassionate at times, as though he either grew tired of the role or was given too much freedom in his portrayal. As a result, the Joker, once a tragic figure you couldn't take your eyes off, becomes less tangible and more abstract. The menace and unpredictability that made him such a fascinating character are absent here.

Lady Gaga, meanwhile, brings a raw energy to her role as Harley Quinn, but she is underutilized throughout the film. Her character has none of the layers we saw in Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn. Gaga's Quinn feels like a shell of a character, a missed opportunity to add a new dynamic to the Joker's story. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga is there but never quite takes off, leaving Gaga's talents largely wasted.

The pacing of Folie à Deux is its biggest downfall. The first half of the film moves so slowly that it feels as if it's deliberately wasting time, only for the second half to be nothing more than a repetition of the first Joker. Rather than progressing the narrative, the film constantly looks back, rehashing events from the first film through unnecessary exposition and flashbacks. There is no forward momentum, no fresh take on the story, and no meaningful development in the Joker's psychological journey. This backward-looking structure also dilutes any potential the film had in exploring new aspects of Arthur Fleck's mind. The psychological depth that was so integral to the success of the first film feels watered down here, leaving nothing of substance to grasp onto. The final act completely derails whatever semblance of narrative cohesion the film was trying to maintain.

The final scenes leave the viewer not with a sense of closure or deeper understanding, but with frustration and confusion. It's a messy, misguided conclusion that fails to tie together the film's already loose threads. Call it provocation without substance. The viewer is left asking, What was the point of all this?

Of course visually, the film is striking. Todd Phillips and his team have an eye for powerful imagery. The lighting, cinematography, and overall production design are aesthetically pleasing, with some hauntingly beautiful moments - particularly those involving the Joker, cigarette in hand, smoke swirling in the dim light. But there are only so many times you can watch the Joker, dramatically bathed in backlight, exhale cigarette smoke before even that feels tiresome. While Phillips deserves credit for crafting a beautiful film on the surface, it lacks the emotional and psychological depth required to make those images stick.

The first film was a visceral exploration of societal alienation, child abuse and the therefore created mental illness, the sequel is aimless, shallow, and scattered. Instead of offering a deeper look into the mind of the Joker, it feels like Phillips wanted to make a statement - one that rebels against critics, fans, and even comic book lovers. But in doing so, he forgot to make a coherent film. What we're left with is a movie that's all style and no substance, a failed experiment that never finds its footing.

Final Verdict: Todd Phillips swung for the fences with Joker: Folie à Deux, but missed. With weak character development, disjointed pacing, and a musical aspect that adds nothing, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the first Joker so memorable. The finale, which could have offered some redemption or clarity, instead devolves into a nonsensical, extravagant mess that leaves the audience bewildered and frustrated. Even the striking visuals can't mask the hollow core beneath, leaving the sequel as a perplexing and underwhelming addition to the Joker's story.

Safe to say the biggest disappointment of the year. 3,5/10."
4.0,4 October 2024,"Sometimes we forget the hidden luck in the tragedy that was Heath Ledger's death, the luck of not seeing his brilliant Joker squeezed to generate more money.

Joaquim Pheonix, in this case, had the misfortune of being alive to see this happen to his character. The first Joker is a solid and complete film, so much so that it doesn't need a sequel. However, unfortunately for him, it made too much money to prevent it to happen.

Today, few things have the privilege of just being completed. There is this relevant discussion that art is just being transformed into content. This movie is nothing more than content, despite the fact that is trying really hard to be more artistic than that.

A more appropriate name would just be a boring Joker 2. However, Folie a Deux was the name chosen, definitely more artistically purposeful for what this film pretends to be, but way less appropriate and honest for what this film ended up being."
9.0,6 October 2024,"I don't think the reviews on IMDB do justice to what a God Awful job the creators of this film achieved. Okay it's a musical, but the least they could have done is make the musical numbers relevant to the story-line. I may as well have been watching Puddles Pity Party Feat Lady Gaga (which ironically I probably would enjoy).. The film is basically a court room drama, with a romance sideline story. There is absolutely nothing DC about this film apart from Location and Character names. You could Joker to Janitor, Change Gotham to Chicago, and have Lady Gaga play a character of a different name, and the film would be pretty much identical.

And to anyone interested YES it IS a musical. I estimate that about 50% of the film are musical numbers that don't move the story along.

I think what vexes me the most is the cast. It's great!, and the actual ACTING is fantastic. But this film did not work because some ""Blue-sky-thinker"" at Warner Bros, said in a board meeting ""Hey, here's a crazy idea... Why don't we make it a musical???"". To whomever that person is, I hope your personal hell is watching this film on repeat for the rest of eternity.... Actually no.. I have sat through this film, and the once I sat through it felt like an eternity. I wouldn't want to wish that on anyone.

One of the first things someone is going to do when this hits the internet is go through and re-edit this film to cut out all the musical numbers.

I would like to go further, but fear that my account would be deactivated if I actually said what I want to."

1.0,2 October 2024,"I had been looking forward to the sequel to the first Joker movie for so long. But what a disappointment. The first Joker film was a masterpiece and one of my favorite films ever. But unfortunately, the scenes were ruined by musical performances, which just felt strange for this type of movie. I missed more acting, more dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix, as always, was absolutely fantastic in the role of Joker, and his acting was what lifted the movie. Lady Gaga actually did really well too, but it felt like the director had decided that because she was in it, everything had to be about singing. Lady Gaga doesn't need song and music; she is a really fine actress. So, all in all, I'm just super disappointed with this movie and had expected something entirely different."
2.0,4 October 2024,"Arthur Fleck is admitted to Arkham state hospital where he meets Harleen Lee Quinzel during musical therapy session for Ward B. His lawyer Maryanne is trying to prove Arthur has dissociative identity disorder and Joker is his split personality in order to prove his mental illness. Harleen confesses her admiration of Joker to Arthur and how she relates to him the most. This leads to him falling in love with her while his trial begins. Maryanne wants to prove Arthur Fleck as innocent whereas Harleen wants Arthur to embrace Joker completely. What happens when Arthur tries to stop his shadow aka Joker, forms rest of the story.

Todd Phillips and team have come up with a thin storyline to be stretched into sequel and turning this into a musical helps in increasing the runtime. However, the world of Arthur's fantasy and his reality, though filmed well, doesn't really clash together in the way intended. Lady Gaga was born to play Harleen Lee Quinzel but sadly her role is poorly written. Credit goes to Lady Gaga for elevating her character. Joaquin Phoenix continues his act from Joker and though he looked a bit less convincing in the songs, he made it up in the key scenes. It was the messed up final act and that ""climax"", that derailed the film entirely. With a threadbare storyline, it was always going to be an uphill task to match the far superior prequel."
5.0,4 October 2024,"After watching the 5 years ago, i went to the cinema like a kid going for icecream.

Film looks pretty good, actors do a good enough job, and that's it.

If this was not a sequel, i would give it maybe a 5-6.

But, as it stands, this was one of the most disappointing films i've ever seen, and it also ruined the first one. I wish in knew into what i was walking.

I kept thinking on the way home why would they do this. I am pretty sure that its because the director/writer/whatever thinks he's better or smarter than the audience, which is absolutely laughable.

There will come a time when the movie industry will implode and i will be as happy then as these people are for deconstructing and subverting everything one can like in any IP.

The story was going nowhere. The action pacing was was so slow it was almost going backwards. Thie portrayals of both characters were completely ""off"" from the comics and what most people preserve as the Joker and Harley Quin.

Generally, just a boring waste of time.

Why the hell it needed to be made into a musical is beyond me, I cringed multiple times throughout the movie when they started signing again.

A total miss for me and I'm determined to do the public a favour and turn people away from it.

I'm not sure who this was made for but I can now understand why the cinema was almost empty when we went to see it."
5.0,8 October 2024,"I still regret every second I waited for the second part, long events, half singing and half kissing, a tragic ending that revealed that the Joker's girlfriend was just a prostitute, she loved him only because he is the Joker and not because she is Arthur Fleck and the moment of the Joker's death was tragic, it showed that he lived a miserable life and died miserable too, if they stopped in the first part it would have been better for them and made the ending open, I hate this type of movies that give you a dark ending and remind the person of his miserable life, life is enough, it does not need more evidence of its blackness and to be fair the only thing I liked in the ending is that it showed that society only loved Arthur because he played the role of the avenger of society and when poor Arthur returned no one cared about him anymore, Todd Phillips why didn't you stop from the first part and make the ending open."
4.0,4 October 2024,"I got excited after seeing the sequel of the joker, and that I would enjoy that much more than the first one, but all I got in the movie is singing... And that's irritating to hear singing them in every 10 minutes. It's really disappointing how they make The Joker from best to worst. Wish I could get some more of that old Harley Quinn and Joker that I have been seeing from years, but that was nowhere near to that exotic and thriller duo we saw even into the cartoons, and also can't compare this movie to the first one. Joaquin phoenix was the main character of Joker, but In this it's all about Singing contest for Lady Gaga.."
8.0,6 October 2024,"This take on the Joker could have only gone one of two ways: build up the Joker on his next steps towards the ultimate super-villain, or fold him up and place him neatly back into his plastic box with the rest of the toys. This is the most basic way of illustrating why this film shouldn't have been made in the first place. Since, it has been made plain by Todd Phillips that he didn't want to make this a franchise, or go beyond this sequel, then the latter boring option of resolving the events of the first film was the only course, and of course, what's the point of that.

Even some of the oft praised, somewhat original, parts of the film, the opening animation sequence for example, foreshadow that you're in for a completely contrived (and completely absent from the first film) bit of screenwriting armchair psychology. Was the Joker a distinct personality of Arthur Fleck or just one dark side of him? Was the Joker just the abused loner all along? There is no deeper sigh to be had.

In scene after scene, you keep waiting for the unfolding events to click into some kind of rhythm, but you get the sense that every time the writers weren't sure what to do next, they would distract you with a musical number from Lady Gaga. There was no natural flow, it all felt flimsily strung together, and that's all thrown on top of, and largely because of, a set of circumstances in which telling a compelling story was probably nearly impossible in the first place."

5.0,4 October 2024,"Oh dear. Like so many other cinema goers, I was so looking forward to this film, but left the cinema at the end feeling utterly deflated. The first instalment of Joker was a breath of fresh air, particularly considering films portraying the DC comics world have often received mixed reactions, usually predominantly negative. Joker was dark, edgy and humorous. Joker Folie a Deux has none of these qualities. The concept of the film being part musical sounded a weird idea when I first heard about it, but with Lady Gaga on board I thought it could work. Making the basis of the film a courtroom 'drama' was a massive own goal though. The rhythm of the film fell as flat as a pancake. I feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix who clearly suffered for his art judging by his gaunt appearance. This is another classic example of Hollywood trying to be too clever for its own good. The writers need to understand that 'if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it' Give the fans what they want and they will return time and again. A massive wasted opportunity."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) was a major letdown compared to the first film. The addition of musical elements felt awkward and out of place, disrupting the gritty tone that made Joker stand out. While Joaquin Phoenix's performance was solid, the weak script and disjointed plot left little room for emotional depth or character development. The pacing was inconsistent, dragging in parts and rushing others. Instead of being a bold sequel, it felt like a confused attempt that fell flat in delivering the raw intensity of the original. I can not understand the Director what was thinking especially in musical scenes."
2.0,4 October 2024,"There was no real story the only good thing ist some nice cinematic scenes, the cartoon and great performances from Lady Gaga and especially Joaquin Phoenix. You could cut out the music parts and this movie would be 1.5h of 6/10 rating. And the resources for those scenes could have made such an interesting court drama, but we got this, well how do I say it without it being against the guidelines, special art of a movie, a musical that does not fit in well into this world they build in the first movie. Some parts are really interesting but don't really get more attention. I don't say music or singing is bad especially for the joker, but a musical that's too much with everything else that's going on

All in all don't watch it just a waist of time:("
4.0,4 October 2024,"The film could have been a great movie bit unfortunately it was completely ruined by Gaga turning it into a musical. It just wasn't necessary. The only reason I can see it became a musical was to elevate lady Gaga, without music her roll would have been minimal.

I thought then story was good, I quite enjoyed it but it was completely broken up by a song that really wasn't needed. It felt like the music was added to prolong the running time of the movie.

I thought had we had a real actress play harlequin we would have had a box office winner in this sequel sadly Lady Gaga didn't do this movie any favours and I'll be reluctant to watch any movies in future that she's in."

The cinematography was awesome, but the movie it's self was speaking to an entirely different audience than those who fell in love with the first Joker. The best part of the movie in my opinion was the trailer...the trailer gave me chills and made me excited. It honestly felt like false advertising. The trailer did not depict the movie I anticipated, nor the movie I watched in theatre. The first joker I loved so much I seen it twice in theatre and it had me talking for days; this one however I have been trying to forget to not taint my fond memories of the first Joker. It wasn't for me personally, but hopefully the mark wasn't missed for everyone......."
5.0,4 October 2024,"I was excited to finally see this movie. But what a disappointment it was. Storyline... dunno, was there a story? There was a theme: 'forbidden love' maybe, or who can you trust when you have noone left? But damn... it felt like a musical... which at first I thought (the first songs) was quite special. But it went on and on... half-sung/spoken by both of them.

There were a few nice moments, some nice shots and Joaquin is a brilliant actor, but there was no tension, no build-up, no suspence or even excitement. Plots-twists? None. Drama? Mêh!

No, I did not read any review in any newspaper, but that's what I'm going to do now... let's see!"

4.0,5 October 2024,"-- Narcissistic personality disorder: It is characterized by a general pattern of grandiosity. The person who suffers from it is preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, intelligence or ideal love. He or she reacts to criticism with feelings of rage, shame or humiliation.

Since last Thursday I began to find a large number of posts on social media that disqualified this film in an aggressive way.

After watching it yesterday afternoon, I can understand why it has disappointed many people.

The sequel to the Joker is a story of failure. More than the story of Batman's famous arch enemy, it is a plot that focuses on Arthur Fleck, the mentally ill man who created the Joker in his mind as a defense mechanism against a life of pain and dissatisfaction.

The director intelligently chooses to use music as an escape balm for Arthur and his tormented mind. All of Arthur/Joker's musical sequences are escapist fantasies in which he is loved, admired, and displayed with ease and wit... everything he cannot achieve in real life.

The sequel also issues an unreserved criticism of the media that tends to praise and put disturbed people on a pedestal of popularity.

The disappointment of several viewers who do not find the disruptive character of the first installment here is understandable.

In exchange, we have an honest account of a man dealing with mental illness and the labyrinths that lie in his mind.

Lady Gaga gives us a Harley Quinn that serves to confront Arthur with the alter ego he has created. Is the Joker an extension of Arthur or is Joker a fantasy to deal with the pain of a life full of frustrations?

When Arthur finds the answers within himself, he disappoints many but finds some peace.

I perceive here a brave and risky approach that separates itself from the tone that gave so much prestige to the first installment. Over time, I believe that it will be given the value it deserves for not romanticizing a deranged antihero and instead, approaching with compassion and empathy the story of a guy with a mental disorder."
5.0,3 October 2024,"Why was there so much singing in the movie, it was boring and there was no real story in it. I can't say that this was a sequel but more a side story/musical. It's Arthur in jail or in court, whenever lady Gaga appears it will involve singing and dancing. I really don't know why they made this movie, yes we're expecting a sequel that means the story continues. But this movie did not made anyone's expectations (that's what I'm thinking).

Acting was great I have got to say that but it's the storyline that made no sense at all. And why oh why the singing and dancing, they didn't do any addition to the storyline, if they skipped that the movie was way shorter in length.

Very very disappointing!!!"

5.0,4 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is one of this year's most anticipated films, or maybe just my most anticipated film, yet it's this year's biggest letdown film. The first Joker is very special for me and my page, as this was the first movie I reviewed, and I also enjoyed it. I'm a very sentimental person, and when they announced that there would be a sequel, I was excited. Then they confirmed Lady Gaga would play as Harley; I was even more excited. The biggest lesson I learned from this movie, I guess, is to lessen your expectations. From the direction and writing, the whole film felt like it was written by a mediocre kid at school who thinks everything they did is superior---It's that bad, really!

The writing and direction felt uninspired and lazy. The film follows Arthur Fleck's life, waiting for his trial for the crimes of Joker. While struggling with his dual identity as Arthur Fleck and Joker, Arthur stumbles upon true love and finds the music that's always inside him. The synopsis may have the potential to be a poignant exploration of mental health, but the film struggles to find its footing. The pacing is almost unbearable, as it gets dragged and dragged with nowhere to go. The film doesn't know what it is trying to convey; the dialogue is flat, and the musical element does not match the narrative.

One of the most disjointed elements is the musical component, which seems awkwardly inserted rather than seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The music fails to enhance the story or characters, instead feeling like an afterthought. Although the musical element serves as Joker and Harley's fantasies, it just doesn't work well with the narrative they are trying to deliver. Adding the musical aspect to their dialogues made the film almost feel comical and pretentious. Lee said, ""I'm pregnant."" ""What?!"" Arthur replied, then Lee, out of nowhere, belted out, ""Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?"" It was hilarious.

For a $200 million budget, it's a massive letdown. It is weird to have this much budget, yet no extra or grand was happening. The film's settings were only at the jail and courtroom, so where did the $200 million budget go? Compared to Denis Villeneuve's ""Dune: Part Two,"" which was this year's biggest film, it only has a $190 million budget, but the CGI effects and the quality of the film are far from ""Joker: Folie à Deux."" Even the first installment has a budget of $65 million, yet it made an astounding $1.07 billion at the global box office.

When it comes to the performances, both Joaquin Phoenix and Stefani Germanotta (famously known as Lady Gaga) were electrifying. I appreciate that they are singing live, which added authenticity to their character, and the contrast in their voices sounded so good. However, due to the film's lack of characterization, the addition of Harley ""Lee"" Quinn to this saga is rather unnecessary and underutilized. The addition of Harley Quinn could have been a great character to explore, but as the movie progresses, she fades into the background although her character plays a vital role in Joker's life; it's not that she has less screen time but because there was nothing written for her character aside from being Joker's love interest. Although Joaquin Phoenix was great in this movie, it's apparent that they are capitalizing on his success in the first installment after winning the Oscar for Best Actor and the movie gaining $1 Billion at the box office. Still, sadly, it turned out to be a disorganized and uninspiring film.

Everything in this film felt like a mistake. It's a cash-grab movie with nothing promising to offer. The musical aspect could be more cohesive to the whole film. Even the final scene felt like Todd Philips just wanted to end the Joker saga to avoid any further sequels. From start to finish, the film stumbles to find its ground. The entire experience of watching this film felt like witnessing a series of missteps. It comes across as a project primarily motivated by the desire to generate revenue without offering anything genuinely innovative or exciting for the audience. As a sequel, there is an expectation to build upon the strengths of its predecessor, but this movie struggles to find its own identity and purpose. This film is particularly disappointing for fans of the first installment, like myself. The original set a high bar with its depth and complexity, and as someone who appreciated its nuances, I hoped for a sequel that would expand on those strengths. Instead, I left the theater feeling let down by a film that failed to capture the essence of what made the original so impactful.

In conclusion, this sequel misses the mark on multiple fronts, failing to capture the depth and innovation that made its predecessor so compelling. Its lack of cohesion and purpose feels like a disservice to fans who anticipated a continuation worthy of the original's legacy. The disjointed musical elements rushed ending, and overall inconsistency contribute to a viewing experience that feels more like a series of missed opportunities than a meaningful story. While the film may achieve commercial success or not, it ultimately falls short of delivering the artistic and narrative fulfillment that audiences were hoping for. As a fan, seeing such potential go unrealized is disheartening, leaving one to wonder what could have been with more thoughtful execution. ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a testament that not all sequels are necessary."
5.0,6 October 2024,"A movie which supposed to be the ascension of Joker turned into the destruction of Arthur. 😭 I wanted to see justice for him and punishment for the ones that did him wrong all his life. He really was a real Joker, a symbol for us all who suffered at the hand of bullies and people with power. But as it may seem...good people are weak people, therefore easy to break.

More about the movie, why the on earth was it transformed into a MUSICAL??? There was no need for that, the music in the first one was more than perfect, why did they have to mess it up? Just because Gaga had to show up the singing talent? No thank you, Joker was more than that.

I do appreciate though that they didn't transform this movie into a Lee movie and they still kept Arthur as the main character. This is the only thing i liked about this movie, I'm sorry, but it wasn't worth watching. 😔"
4.0,5 October 2024,
5.0,16 October 2024,"As someone who enjoyed the first movie for the liberties it took with 'The Joker' I was looking forward to seeing how they would expand on it in the sequel. While I can see the goal they were going for, I was a little put off by the path they took doing it.

First off, from a psychological view of the movie, it is masterfully done by giving you a very intricate look into various aspects of the mind and how they can become twisted to include interpretation and perception. I am a huge fan of when a movie can relay the various ways a mind can be broken, even if at first one doesn't notice it.

Second, I am not a fan of the musicals strewn throughout. While I understand they are more a twisted perception of what is going on, it also really destroys parts of the scene. I get that his mind is messed up and it is coming to terms with it in various ways, but I don't think the musical aspect of it did it proper justice.

Lastly, while I am a fan of the source of the Joker, I can't say I dislike the conclusion or the very brutal nature of scenes in this movie. To reiterate, I looked at this from a more psychological view point, understood the purpose of what they were trying to relay about the character while also realizing they were trying to keep it rooted in a more realistic setting rather than a drawn out comic arch villain setting. Those who are true to the source of the character will have qualms with the movie, for sure, and I can't blame them. However, if they can see beyond that and see it is more rooted in a reality sense then they might understand that this is just a set up for a very different kind of Joker.

Those who watched to the very end know what I mean by this, but I don't want to spoil it. I do wonder how many understood it though...."
4.0,20 October 2024,"I think the hate that this film is receiving came mostly from disappointed fans of the previous film, expecting more. While I do agree that this film doesn't live up to expectations, I do believe that it damages the film's reputation too much. I also think, that with a bit of adjustments, it has the potential to become so much more.

The way I see this film is a fishbowl filled with a mix of bronze balls and gold balls. When you pick one by one out of the bowl, you'll be getting some poor bronzes. But at times, you'll also be getting gold ones. So to me the film is a mix of these. There are some good scenes that are really nice and enjoyable, but there are also some awkward scenes that can just be thrown away.

Prime examples of this is with the excessive use of musical fantasy. I understand Todd Phillips vision, having this ""out-of-place"" musical scenes be a visual representation of Arthur's fantasy, thoughts, and emotions. But there's just too much of it, and most of them don't contribute much to the plot and are just there for styles. By removing those unnecessary musical features, and replacing them with real dialogues or a more impactful scene can truly bring this film up a few notches.

Now there are more flaws in this film than just the musical features. One I notice is the slow, rough pacing. It took half of the film duration to reach the court, and it took another half to finish that court. I thing that all of those sequences can be trimmed and squeezed together, cutting it down to an hour, leaving more space to expand on the ending, which brings me to my second point.

The ending is lazy and is only there for temporary emotion for when you leave the theatre and are on your way home. After that, the film is wiped out of your memory and you go on with your life. The ending also feels like it's like that just to end the Joker's story, and be like ""th- th- th- that's all folks!"".

But to me, some parts of this films deserves more attention. The court scene, while long, really lets us to explore and discover Arthur's identity, showing the impacts he had done and how he reflects on it. Some fantasy scenes, like when he beats up the court members are worthy of putting. The after-explosion scene where joker is fled by his fans, is a good scene. And I have to appreciate the superb performances by Joaquin Pheonix, and other cast members.

So despite all of the major or even minor flaws like awkward shot or teribble dialogue, there are still rooms for appreciation in this film. While it might not be what people expected, it is still quite enjoyable. There are a lot of areas that should be explored more, but that will be all I have to say about this film."
5.0,3 October 2024,"As unfortunately and as I expected the musical did ruin this movie.

I can't believe I've waited this long, because I was surrendered to the first movie as I never expected before , and I think a lot of people had so many expectations for this movie, not only because of the masterpiece but also the choice of Lady Gaga, I mean, there was no other women that would suit this part .

But all the movie was bad elaborated , where was the story (?)I left feeling I only saw 15 min of movie and the rest was music. Disappointed to say the least , this could have been magnificent !And all to end like this."
10.0,4 October 2024,"I rate this 5 only for the cinematography and for joaquin.phoenix performance.

Joker 1 was a masterpiece but this movie is a mess and in my opening this mess is intended by politicians to oppress and suppress rebellious personalities and to destroy the joker character that call for justice and freedom as a result of what happening now in the world and the protesters everywhere refusing what is happening in the world specially what is happening in the Middle East .

Also turning the joker movie to a musical movie is a very silly idea.

As I am a big fan of joker 1 movie( rated it 10) , I am so disappointed from this movie :("
5.0,18 October 2024,"I was a bit disappointed after watching the Joker: Folie à Deux(2024) movie.

If it weren't for Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's nice performances, the beautiful cinematography, and some wonderful scenes, I would have struggled to sit through the entire film. The plot felt boring and empty to me.

I do not say I love musical but I sometimes eagerly watch musicals, but the musical scenes in this film seemed somewhat out of place. They didn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie, even though Lady Gaga and even Phoenix performed and sang very well.

When I decided to watch the film, I had much higher expectations for it and for Todd Phillips as a director. But I left the theater disappointed."

4.0,7 October 2024,"The original Joker has been categorized as a ""psychological thriller"" and this movie has been categorized as a ""musical psychological thriller."" The theater listing categorizes the movie singularly as ""suspense."" Let's be clear. There is no mystery, suspense, or thriller here. And aside from brief acts of violence, there is no action. I agree with critics that call this a ""quasi-musical courtroom drama.""

Avoiding pre-release marketing, as I do, I had no idea I was in store for a musical. The movie ""boasts"" 15 musical numbers, oddly, only 4 less than West Side Story (1961). That said, the singing was intentionally fashioned to be ""unprofessional."" So there's that. Joaquin Phoenix's singing voice sounds like Randy Newman on a bad day.

To be fair, Phoenix delivers a tour-de-force performance as he did in the original. However, the feature length movie built out from it is a vapid house of cards with no true ""plot"" to speak of.

The courtroom footage was dry and befuddling at best. And to say that Zazie Beetz ""reprises"" her role from the original movie is disingenuous as it's no more than about 5 minutes of testimony.

Phoenix is imprisoned for the ENTIRETY of the movie, and, inexplicably, Lady Gaga is seemingly allowed to come and go as she pleases.

Most of the musical numbers are sung ""in fantasy"" and some seemingly (but not conclusively) ""out of fantasy.""

Frankly, then, the movie is not a satisfying musical or courtroom drama or thriller. It's more akin to a clumsy campy misguided version of La La Land."
2.0,8 October 2024,"At first i was liking it, the combination of blue and gray tones were great with the yellow lightning and window shadows, some of the shoots were good and interesting but it was fine until they started singing and im not talking like oh its a musical they suck, no. I have seen great musicals like ""Signing in the rain"" amazing films but this which was cataloge as a genre of a musical was dissapointing, they sang like they were talking which fine but there wasnt a show, the singing was flat and the dancing awful although i kinda see the point in they way the character dances and gives off his vibe but still sometimes the signing was unnecessary in some parts. If they wanted the storyline to be the court that movie could of have a lot of potencial but filmed in another point of view and a totally different angle. I do not recommend just watch the first one, this was like a spin-off badly made."
9.0,14 October 2024,"This film was absolute garbage in a high-end package. It wasn't even the musical part that the film had. It was annoying, but still bearable. It was the hollowing out of the story and the misuse of the term ""Folie A Deux"" - there was, in my opinion, no real significant emotional interaction between Phoenix and Gaga. It was just a completely superficial relationship. A true Folie A Deux involves a primarily ill, dominant person, usually schizophrenia, and the induced person. This is not initially delusional, but is mentally unstable. As a rule, she has an emotionally close, possibly dependent relationship with the dominant person. Often these are close relatives who are so influenced by the sick person that they ultimately uncritically share the delusion or even the delusional system. Often the delusional content expands even further and those affected reinforce each other's delusions. A possible motive is that the induced person initially hopes that the relationship will be stabilized by adopting the delusion."

3.0,4 October 2024,"Saw this in theaters the day it came out. Both my wife and me love the first movie, so we were excited to see this.

Unfortunately the movie doesn't come close to what made the first movie great. The story just isn't even remotely interesting. It largely rethreads what happened in the first movie, but not even by showing but telling. There's only so many times you can hear characters drone on about how the joker shot someone on live TV. The movie is cut with a frankly ridiculous number of songs woven in that for the most part serve 0 purpose to the story and primarily just break up the pace. It felt like a rather poor attempt st a musical. Both me and my wife were groaning by the 4th song due to boredom, unfortunately they just kept coming. In a mostly empty theater (afternoon showing) there were still 3 seperate groups of people that walked out 45-30 minutes before the end (as what felt like the 10th song started in).

Throughout the movie the ending is somewhat foreshadowed as we see Arthur coming to terms with what the joker has done. Phoenix does an amazing job of once again portraying a man struggling with mental issues. We were less impressed with gaga. While great in her own way she didn't feel like a good fit for Harley. The relationship between her an Arthur also felt like the wrong dynamic (which, considering the events of the ending, makes sense). We felt the entire movie should have been the first 45 minutes or so of the actual film (which might roughly be the runtime without all the useless songs) before the story really kicks off.

In summary the acting and cinematography were great as it was in the first movie. But a pretty picture cannot save the absolute train wreck of a story and the lack of any character progression or stakes."
2.0,4 October 2024,"After the intense psychological exploration in the first part of Joker, this sequel falls short in many ways. While the original film provided a deep and unsettling look into the psyche of Arthur Fleck and his transformation into the iconic villain, this installment seems to lack that same focus. Instead of building on the character's mental unraveling, the movie distracts itself with songs that don't seem to fit the narrative or enhance the story in any meaningful way. The plot feels disjointed and fails to capture the raw emotion and tension that made the first Joker film so compelling.

The majority of the scenes come across as incoherent, lacking a clear direction or purpose. For much of the runtime, it's difficult to understand what the movie is trying to achieve, and the pacing feels uneven. The only moment that truly stands out is the final second of the film, which delivers a payoff that might resonate with hardcore fans of the DC Universe. However, for those who are not well-versed in the intricacies of the DC lore, even this moment may leave viewers feeling confused or unsatisfied.

In summary, Joker 2024 doesn't capture the same depth or tension as its predecessor. Its reliance on unrelated musical choices and a plot that only makes sense to those deeply familiar with DC's background diminishes what could have been a powerful continuation of the Joker's story."
1.0,7 October 2024,Honestly one of the worst modern movies todate. The music was honestly the best part. The melodrama was the worst. Why crumble a character in such a boring way? At least make it memorable. And lady Gaga was excellent but her character wasn't. They did her wrong. Overall this movie didn't need to exist. It painfully dishonors the legacy of its predecessor which is actually a pretty good film. This felt like a major cash grab with zero substance and nothing valuable to add the story. This is why most sequels shouldn't exist. But in the age of streaming it's the primary economy for Hollywood unfortunately...
9.0,4 October 2024,"Honest review, no spoilers.

I would not see this if you don't want to sit through a Lady Gaga musical. Honestly the first one was vastly better. It felt like I was waiting for the story to really pick up the whole time. The ending is where everything finally made sense and clicked into place, but it was only the very very end when you get that satisfaction of the story, it seems to set up a possible 3rd installment.

Acting was fantastic though. Joaquin Phoenix Is always excellent. Lady Gaga was great, just didn't feel like all the singing was necessary... I did also love the hilarious little Joker cartoon they put in for the opening scene!"
5.0,5 October 2024,"A truly brilliant, moving, evocative, emotional, poignant, gripping, tragedy (in a good way)! An expertly crafted story with such an important message to share about mental illness, abuse, and how often our social system fails those who struggle with these conditions and upbringings and the resulting consequences of repeated failures. It's so sad, but it does happen and this movie, as well as the first, strives to bring the all to light and give it the weight and consideration it deserves.

All these bros spouting so much vitriol because it wasn't some superficial, glossy, 1 dimensional supervillain story that they somehow expected even though the first movie in no way promised or set this up. 🙄 Get over yourself!

Don't let the loud voices of hate sway you. Go see this masterpiece of a movie and decide for yourself.

And the ending! SO GENIUS!!!"
2.0,5 October 2024,"People don't try to see the movie from Joker eyes, they just want the director to do what they want but that's not how it works. We all want that crazy Joker from many comic stories and movies but there are many representations of him, this one don't fail to show it.

It's sad to see the reactions and even hear some comments because just shows how limited people are nowadays, they don't even try to understand what's in front of them and the director knew about this and that's why in a point close to the end where people should be feeling what the Joker say they just laugh and agree, because they don't put themselfs in his fantasy world. Manipulation to his best by the director.

Great performances as expected and it's a very believable story in the Joker world that's what matters, don't go away from what he his. Ofc this isn't any build up to a crazy Batman universe so you need to see this as a musical and with some understanding of who is the Joker, if you can't see the movie thinking you're in his feet's but you're just there to consume wathever is in front of you then it's not worth.

For the fans of the Joker I think it's a great movie, for people that don't have any idea of who he his or just want some crazy action like its usual in super heroes movies, don't waste time."
4.0,5 October 2024,"This sequel quite literally has no plot. There is no story structure whatsoever it is a pure musical. I wouldn't have hated this but it has zero connection to the edgy style of the first film. My girlfriend and I walked out 3/4 of the movie in as we couldn't take Arthur bursting into yet another musical number with the same style as all of the other musical numbers. Avoid this movie if you liked the first one.

Lady Gaga was fine at acting, but not amazing. I would almost say this could be a children or high school film if it wasn't for the hardcore sex scene between the 2 main characters. Skip this one."

4.0,10 October 2024,"Or ""the Clown with his pants falling down"".

This film had the potential to be memorable, but instead, it seems to be deliberately dull. As the movie itself states, ""All we had was the fantasy"" and they gave up on it. So now, ""we aren't going anywhere""!

I didn't particularly like the original (due to my own expectations and interest in the franchise). Who goes to the theater expecting a realistic, somber tale about one of Batman's most iconic villains detached of its more fantastical elements? But even I could see what the original delivered-Powerful imagery of someone becoming a symbol and an emissary of chaos and change. It had depth, it was a good study on the topics and even a message! But it was never about THE Joker. It was a good movie with a franchise label slapped on so it would sell better.. and it never had the intention to deliver on it's promise. It was clear to me then, and now it seems to be obvious to everyone else now! The negative reactions come as no surprise, as they chose not to follow through on the character and what audiences rightfully expected.

This sequel is well-shot, well-cast, and executed according to its own vision. The premise was solid, and the foundation could have been interesting.. but doesn't build upon that, the script and interactions are weak, and leaves the audience without gratification. Instead, it closes the book on the story of a man that just wanted normalcy! And personally, I think it was fine.

More than anything, I found Lee Quinzel to be one of the few aspects that echoed the promise of the original. She wanted him to keep the chaos alive. But in the end, there's no grand, satisfying plan. Fantasies may be integral to the character, and she understood what music meant to him (as means of manipulation), but ultimately, they don't help the film.. specially when they interrupt what it little it offers constantly.

The unnecessary final ""nod"" at Christopher Nolan's departure from WB is hollow, cheap and insulting. Watch it on streaming.. if at all."
9.0,7 October 2024,"Folie a Deux - a madness/delusion shared by 2: unfortunately, appears not to relate so much to the characters in the film as it does the film writers, Scott Silver and Todd Phillips. How they came to some of the 'creative' decisions they did, can only have been through some kind of shared madness.

This film failed on so many fronts. Joaquin Phoenix performed very well again and Gaga did OK too in that respect.

Making it a musical though was just a stupid idea. I mean, it ain't exactly the fare of your typical Mamamia fan is it? What's the plan here: to make it into a stage show? If so, I'll be there for sure, on opening night: with a truck of rotten tomatoes. And Broadway shall become La Tomatina!

At the start, you could kinda look past a couple of the songs as being momentary drifts into fantasy but before long, the pattern becomes apparent - that hackneyed lazy pattern - a tiny little plot development before... ah crap, I can feel another one coming - yep, repeated gratuitous pointless musical diversions that fail to progress the story or develop the characters but just serve to each add a few more minutes to the run-time.

Even if we ignore the decision though, to hitch a farcical ride on the coat tails of LaLaLand, there were crimes that completely invalidate the worth of this movie, worst of which: writers broke canon so badly (I'm no comic book nerd fussing over details but these were no details) that this character simply was no longer Joker and Gaga's character really wasn't Harley Quinn.

Joker, nemesis to Batman, is chaotic, frenetic, clever: crazy, yes but charismatic. But most of all, he is successful - an arch villain! The character in this movie lived and died without transcending 'sad loser' status. He certainly never came close to being an arch villain. He did a crime on TV, got famous and got caught - so what?

Similarly his girlfriend was really just a saddo hybristophiliac - there was nothing brilliant about her, nothing special or 'beautifully twisted' she wasn't even particularly mental - just a little messed up, and a bit stupid.

I'm not blaming the actors here, they played well but the characters were, all said and done, flimsy nobodies that bore no resemblance to their namesakes other than the most superficial of traits. Frankly, they were little more than stolen names.

Thing is though, there were moments of opportunity, when it could all have been pulled back - when our doubt, that there was ever anything truly significant about these characters, could have been smashed, exploded, vaporised with a little twist in the plot. But no, it never came and in the end they were just a couple of insignificants who got their 15 minutes of fame in New York (Oops erm we mean Gotham, your honour) and faded away again. Just as I trust this film will from my memory."
5.0,7 October 2024,"As some people say, you can't expect a second movie which has the exact same character as the first one BUT I think this movie doesn't deserve so many bad reviews! Sure there is a lot of singing but calling it a musical is taken far away... all the singing has its place to be and displays really good the inner of the protagonists thoughts.

This movie is definitely not what you expect after the first joker but with an important ending it leaves space for a continuing story the most people want to see.

I think people wanted to see the joker rise but in this case you only get to know more of the character Arthur Fleck. And with that said and with the final scene of the movie, you'll get to see the movie with a different perspective."
4.0,10 October 2024,"Are you kidding?? A Musical really?? What in the hell was Todd thinking, The Joker is an eternal DC villian and after 2 movies he is killed off, Wow how dissapointing, an unworthy and terrible secuel, Harley plays no relevance whatsoever, mediocre script, terrible story with no sense at all, seriously what the hell???, why is this not balanced at all, first movie was a Masterpiece, and this crap goes beyond Hell, what a waste, how could Studios back up this movie crappy movie?? Hope it gets the failure it deserves, a great actor like Joaquin Phoenix is not waste in movies like this, this is pure disaster."
5.0,4 October 2024,"The first one was great, how did they manage to make a mess of a movie as a sequel to Joker?!

Making it musical was the wrong approach. It simply does not work. Every time I got engaged, they'd start to brain-dead sing for 5 minutes and ruin the moment. Overdone and a movie killer.

They are many ways they could've went with to make a good movie, and this was their best idea?

Should've left the first one sequel-less. The ending was weird and lackluster. What the hell was that? I really wanted this to be at least decent, but nope. What a waste of time. 2+ hours of nothingness.

If you enjoyed Joker then sadly you won't enjoy Joker: Folie à Deux. Don't watch it unless you get paid to do so :)"
5.0,4 October 2024,"Had no idea this was a musical. Thought I would not check out the IMDb score until after the movie, hence did not see that musical was part of the description. I am not a fan of musicals in general, but to have, what I believed was going to be a similar themed movie to the first, be completely replaced by songs every five minutes was a shock. I actually wanted to leave 30 minutes in but had another movie to see afterwards, hence stuck around hoping things would change. Alas they never did and nothing actually happened in this movie. Lady Gaga showed off her acting and singing talents but besides that, bugger all else happens. Very disappointing."
3.0,13 October 2024,"Every scene of this movie...Lee Quinzel a.k.a Lady Gaga sings all the time..I've never felt she acts Harley Quinn. Lady Gaga acts Lady Gaga like singing and weird dresses..I couldn't focus on the movie. Bcuz she makes Joker sing as well...XD actually i heard people yawning and sighing...this has to be more violent and shown what Joker is about. I felt like I heard things Gaga's Voice in the movie, Star is born, in the sha-ha, sha-la-low, Sha-la-la-la lowww.... Kindly Joker told her what I like to ask for in my mind in the movie....""Stop singing....just Talk to me...."" I feel a bit better....however...I am disappointed."
9.0,13 October 2024,"Last I heard the Joker was a supervillian in the DC comic universe. How do we go from that to a bad Musical. The first Joker movie was ok but this can't be the new norm? All this movie did was rehash everything that happened in the first one. Joaquin needs to take this show to Vegas where it belongs. With lights and showgirls it might make a few bucks. I remember the days when the Joker was a crazed maniac that didn't care who he hurt or killed. Phoenix is a good actor but Heath Ledger will always be the best Joker. Gaga was so so but she's a singer, not an actor. I'm pretty sure somebody is going to lose a lot of money on this one and I doubt (and hope) if there will be a part 3."
5.0,13 October 2024,"Joker: Folie a deux directed by Todd Phillips who also Directed Joker (2019) continues the story of Arthur Fleck now in a Correctional Facility after killing of Murray Franklin in a studio in front of millions of viewers. Arthur Fleck played by extremely talented Joaquin Phoenix ( superb in movie Joker, Her, Two Lovers. C'mon C'mon among too many good roles) is now happy to be loved by Lee Qunizel ( Lady Gaga) who loves Arthur from the moment she see him. Arthur is elated and filled with courage. Physical brutality and mockery of Arthur by Officers is depicted very well. Shared psychosis of Arthur and Lee is exploited very well in the movie . Arthur/Joker is worshipped by many for his boldness and madness even though there is a lot of cruelty and bloodshed. One of my favorite conversations is between Arthur and Lee when Arthur asks Lee "" did you do it?"" and she says yes and he tells her ""you are crazy"" . It takes one to know one.

The movie is directed very well Catherine Keener as Arthur's lawyer Maryanne Stewart is excellent , showing compassion for his cruel actions and explaining her concept of 2 forms of Arthur in him, the cruel and the likeable. I enjoyed the ending of the movie which showed there is a limit to tolerance.

Having read the reviews and being categorized as a musical, i was hesitant in seeing the movie. I am extremely glad my expectations from Joaquin Phoenix as Joker are well met. Excellent actor. Lady Gaga is a good actress. I enjoyed all 2hrs18 min of movie. Excellent screenplay and Direction. Glad i saw the movie."
4.0,4 October 2024,"I wish I could erase this movie from my brain so that I can enjoy the first movie without knowing the disappointing way the story concludes.

The first joker film showed us Arthur's journey from a victim of society, downtrodden and unloved, to his own hero who finally passes his breaking point and learns to stand up for his own beliefs. He finally has confidence, love and self respect and all of his restraints have snapped.

Folie a Deux seems to undo all of that character development and turns him back into victim who will never be able to break free. A theme of the movie is whether the Joker is real or whether he is just a fantasy or figment and the moral of the story appears to be that Arthur will always be just Arthur and nothing more.

The songs add very little to the plot and some seem misplaced as if they've been forced in to the story despite holding almost no relevance.

The plot is incredibly basic and moves nothing forward. Arthur attends court hearings while dating Lee. It seems as though it purposefully makes no sense like it's a nod to Arthur's joke ""I hope my death makes more cents that my life."" At one point Gaga's character, Lee, tells Arthur to stop taking his meds as though there is something planned for him or his rescue but it's never mentioned again and is only relevant to show that Lee only really loves him when he's the Joker rather than himself.

They add strange social commentaries for example Gary from his work in the first movie testifying that Arthur has caused him the same fear that Arthur once felt, as if trying to blatantly point out that evil begets evil, but it just comes across as a bit bizarre and irrelevant.

They also add more information about his mother mocking him to others which seems out of character for how his mother was played in the first movie as though they only added it to make something, anything, happen within the plot.

Phoenix and Gaga do a fabulous job and are the high point of the movie but they're really not given much of a script to work with. The relationship between the characters isn't really explored and there is no Folie a Deux present. Gaga's character fangirls over Joker and they begin a romance. The relationship doesn't go any further, they don't become any kind of chaos causing team-up, they just date a bit while Arthur attends court like she's a groupie which is a disappointment. The relationship between them could have been fascinating if the appropriate time had been spent on it rather than their main on screen time together being during dance sequences.

All in all the movie falls flat. Worth a watch once but once is enough."
4.0,5 October 2024,"Joker 2 really misses the mark, killing the magic of the first film. Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance from the original movie is dragged down by a poor script and random musical numbers that don't fit at all. There are way too many pointless scenes that add nothing, and the whole thing lacks the emotional punch that made the first movie so powerful. Instead of the gritty and intense feel we loved, we get a sequel that feels lost and disappointing. It's a shame because it ruins what could have been a great follow-up, leaving fans frustrated, confused, and wishing it had never been made at all."
3.0,5 October 2024,"I'm not even sure what I was watching. However, Joaquin Phoenix held my attention. He has got to be one of the top 5 best actors ever. He is amazing. Period. At least in my book. It is a joy to watch this guy on screen as he becomes so totally immersed in the roles he plays and as the Joker, he did not fail. Lady Gaga also held her own and although I've always been a fan of hers for her unique voice as a singer, she has shown over the years that she is a force to be reckoned with on the big screen. Anyway, getting back to the movie as a whole, it was a strain to watch. I was lost, desperately longing for more, something I could walk away with to tell my friends to that they must watch this film. Unfortunately I can not say that, instead I called my younger brother, who is the biggest comic book geek to ask him what I had just witnessed. Break out the yellow caution tape on this one, a cinematic homocide has just been committed."
10.0,6 October 2024,
1.0,13 October 2024,"Everything that was expected for the film was ignored. The film really became a musical, and that was disappointing, in addition to several other scenes that do not match the traditional Joker. I believe that the expectation of those who went to the cinema to watch the film was to see the villain again, but they ended up receiving a repentant convict on his way to a death sentence. And that wasn't even the most disappointing part, every time there was a boring musical, when an important dialogue was expected, it was done with melody, and that was a bummer. Anyway, this is just my opinion, go watch it and make up your own mind."

1.0,5 October 2024,"I was excited for ""Joker,"" like anybody else. I didn't even check IMDb for reviews to find out it was a musical and a court drama, both which I don't like.

I could have guessed it with lady gags on board.

So my own fault - but who would have expected this after the first movie. I wished I had left the cinema before it ended, not sure why I did not, probably out of shock and hope.

The film started off confusing, filled with unnecessary song and dance numbers that detracted from the storyline. Instead of a deep exploration of Arthur Fleck's character, I found myself bored as the plot meandered aimlessly.

While Joaquin Phoenix delivered a strong performance, it couldn't save the film or make it less boring. What could have been powerful ended up feeling hollow and unfulfilling."
2.0,11 October 2024,"Did the DC Universe need another Joker? My inclination is to say no. The 2019 version was perfect. Watching Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck descend into madness was terrifying, yet somehow beautiful in its complete darkness. Joker: Folie a Deux simply pales in comparison. Walking in, I knew that it was filled with snippets of musical numbers. Ok, weirdly different. Joker definitely hears voices in his head, so why not throw in some retro pop tunes to go along with them? Why not let him inhabit an entirely different plane of existence, since the one in which he actually lives is, in fact, a prison. Give him a love interest with the same darkness insider her - in this case, Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn - with whom he can sing duets about their love, about how society has failed them, how they'll escape to some paradise in their own minds, if only they can get out of Arkham State Hospital.

But it just doesn't hang together. Yes, Phoenix is menace incarnate, just simply standing there, smoking a cigarette. You can feel it oozing out of his pores. However, I simply couldn't figure out Gaga's motivations for Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel, AKA Harley Quinn regarding her intentions towards Arthur. Yes, she's also psychotic with extreme pyromaniacal tendencies. Joker confessed to killing at least 5 people. She probably killed her own parents. Or did she? Was it all a front just to get close to Joker? That's where I'm confused.

There were a few scenes were I was certain all the action was taking place inside Joker's head, while he was in solitary. And then I was no longer sure. Again - very muddy are these disturbing waters.

The song choices were .... interesting. I don't think the audience for the film is the same audience who would appreciate the chosen tunes. Based on the reactions of the totally obnoxious audience I viewed the film with, I believe I'm very close to the mark on that criticism. Maybe the songs were cheap to purchase. Maybe the filmmakers wanted to utilize songs from that perceived era, a la Sonny and Cher. They just didn't work for me and I knew all the songs. It just felt clumsy and forced.

Folie a deux translates, roughly, to a 'shared madness'. In this case, it's really a folie a trois - Joker, Arthur and Harley. Joker confesses things to Harley he's never told anyone. We believe that his self-disclosures are real. When he sits with his attorney (Catherine Keener), you know he's lying for the court. Harley also shares some self-disclosures, but frankly, I believed absolutely nothing she told Arthur. He may have believed he was sharing his madness with her, but I never felt the same vibe from Quinn. She used him, but I can't guess why, or what she got from it.

Though it didn't appeal to me, Folie may appeal to those with a penchant for imbuing the universe with additional anarchy. I did enjoy the retro-campy cartoon slapped at the top of the film, used to key audiences in on what happened in the original Joker, but, unfortunately, that was the least murky portion of the film. This was a stew that simply never gelled."
10.0,14 October 2024,"Joker Folie a Deux was directed by Todd Phillips and starred Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.

Given how strong and thought-provoking the previous movie was, I had high expectations for Joker: Folie à Deux. Regretfully, this follow-up was a huge disappointment. This follow-up was a chaotic jumble that eclipsed the greatness of the original Joker, which was its unvarnished depiction of mental illness, society's faults, and the spiral into madness.

The tone change was the most startling feature. Folie à Deux adopted a completely different strategy from the first movie, which was realistic and gritty, by including pointless song sequences that didn't go with the Joker's signature dark, psychological tone. Instead of concentrating on a coherent story, it seemed as though the filmmakers were making an excessive effort to make an artistic statement. This abrupt change left me perplexed and disinterested because it didn't seem to fit with my expectations for a Joker movie at all.

In addition, the film's tempo was inconsistent. It was sluggish at a certain point, then abruptly switched to frantic scenes that seemed unrelated to the rest of the narrative. It was difficult to follow and exhausting to watch. There was no obvious direction to the film, so I was left wondering what the objective was. I kept expecting it to pick up or provide some kind of emotional reward, but it never did.

There was also a serious lack of character development. After being so meticulously created in the first movie, Arthur Fleck felt like a shell of the person he used to be. Rather than delving into his more complex psychological makeup, the movie seemed more focused on style and shock effect than content. The storyline provided no significant insight into his metamorphosis, and his objectives were ambiguous. By the end, I had lost any sense of connection to his experience.

Although there were some intriguing visuals, the excessive use of surrealism came across as arrogant and forced. The movie attempted to combine aspects of fantasy and realism, but it was never successful. It came out as unclear and too trying to stand out rather than being original or thought-provoking. Folie à Deux gave off the realistic and approachable feel that made the original Joker so captivating in favor of an exaggerated artistic approach that failed miserably.

Finally, even if the performances weren't bad, they weren't enough to redeem the movie. Despite being amazing in the first movie, Joaquin Phoenix felt underappreciated in this one. The depth and emotional impact that made Arthur so remarkable were absent from his rendition. Even Lady Gaga's performance, for which I had great expectations, was disappointing. Both actors gave performances that felt lifeless and uninspired as if the screenplay didn't offer them enough to work with.

And the ending where the ""twist happen"", yeah that's what killed this movie for me even more. It was confirmed that both Phoenix and Phillips didn't want to make this sequel and it shows.

In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux was a confusing, disjointed, and pretentious sequel that failed to capture the magic of the original. Instead of building on the strong foundation laid by the first film, it veered off into a direction that didn't make sense and wasn't satisfying. I left the theater feeling frustrated, disappointed, and wishing I hadn't wasted my time and money. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who loved the first Joker. It's a huge step-down, and I can't imagine it will resonate with many fans of the character or the original movie. Honestly, if I had the chance to stop this movie from happening I would. I'll just pretend that this film didn't exist and just Joker (2019) is the only film that exists. 5/10."

4.0,13 October 2024,"This movie was such a bold choice. It was not the sequel it's core audience expected.. or wanted. That being said, Phoenix and Gaga were outstanding! Phoenix deserves an Academy Award for all he went through to lose that much weight and embody such a complex character. He was truly amazing!

The musical sequences were not only entertaining but beautifully choreographed. As many reviewers have already pointed out, this movie provides more commentary on mental health, than it does an action-filled super villain movie. The love story and court trial are the main plot lines which weave together well. The movie is also set up for what should be an interesting continuation of the Joker storyline...

Give it a shot if you haven't already despite all the negative reviews. I was well aware of the negative reviews and honestly went to see it expecting not to like it and was pleasantly surprised."
3.0,10 October 2024,"I genuinely can't understand why people hate and are so upset about this movie. We knew it was going to be a sequel, a musical, co star Gaga etc. Etc. Having known all of this prior, I truly can't understand what people we're expecting? I set my bar for the movie extremely low. I'm not a comics or superhero movie fan, which is why the first Joker felt like a breath of fresh air. If I have to see another A list actor on steroids in tights I'm gonna gouge my eyes out. Go watch one of the billion superhero movies that follow cliche cookie cutter formulas, rehashing the same stories over and over ad nauseum if you don't like these interpretations? Like I said, I didn't have high expectations from the get go, I hate virtually all musicals I've ever seen. This seemed like an experiment. I respect director's taking risks, even if the final vision falls somewhat short. Keeps art alive. That being said, I think Joker: Folie à Deux slightly surpassed my (already very low) expectations as A MOVIE. The reality is that I will watch any movie JP is starring in, even if the movie seems bad. I watch Joaquin for what he brings to each performance, more than I generally care about the director or their movies. Joaquin brings a vulnerability, honesty, raw/realness to every performance and always impresses me with how he interprets roles. Was the movie amazing? Definitely not. Was it decently entertaining for a sequel that is a musical? Absolutely.

I will admit that I kind of zoned out during most of the singing parts.... but the acting in between was great and the story was decent imo."
5.0,4 October 2024,"The first film did not need a sequel, but when we heard of a sequel, we had excitement. I have never felt so disappointed watching a film in my life. Apart from some brilliant acting from Joaquin and the guards, and the stunning visuals, this film practically has no other positives. The most disappointing aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the ending. The ideology and symbolism of the ending is perfect, but the execution seems rushed and is awful.

The rest of the film feels dragged out and slow, with unneeded musical sequences every five minutes, but the most important thing of the film, was rushed.

The lengthy courtroom sequence was the only storyline in the film. There was no character development of Harvey Dent. This could have been Harley's origin story but her 'shared madness' is not shown at all in this film.

This film is nothing short of a cashgrab and it despises the first film by trying to completely undo what make Joker so great to begin with.

If you genuinely watched the first ten/twenty minutes of this film, left for an hour, and came back in, there'd be no difference, as the storyline was lacking.

To be honest, this is a must-see film for fans of the first Joker and DC, as it practically ends the potential world of Arthur Fleck.

This film is a love/hate film, and in my opinion I have to watch this again to get my head around what I just witnessed.

3.7 out of 10 for me."
3.0,5 October 2024,"After watching this film, I decided to create an account on imdb, just to write a review on it.

Well, where to start... I saw the first film of the sequel and it was one of the best films I've ever seen. 5 years later, I went to see the second film ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" and I'm giving it 4 stars because the film was 1 star, the other 3 stars were Joaquin Phoenix's performance. Lady Gaga was very average, she didn't complete or add anything to the film at all. The whole film was music, music and more music... I was actually enjoying the film until halfway through, but the feeling the film gave was ""this is going to get better"" and well, it didn't... The ending of the film was empty.

I honestly wish I had never seen this film and just watched the first one. What a disappointment."
10.0,4 October 2024,
5.0,4 October 2024,I absolutely loved this film. For starters the cinematography was amazing and the acting was really really really good as well. And I don't usually enjoy musicals like i can count on one hand the amount I enjoy but i loved this like all the music was used to great effect here and both the lead actors gave phenomenal performances in both the acting department and the music department likewise the score was amazing and the story was absolutely incredible and twisted but extremely well told and i highly recommend this for anyone who likes the first movie or even didn't. This was a worthy follow up and i definitely recommend seeing it as soon as you possibly can! Easy 10/10.
5.0,5 October 2024,
1.0,5 October 2024,"Joker 2 revolves around the viewer getting an expanded look, into Arthur's disturbed an broken mind, while being incarcerated in prison, convicted of the five murders, we saw in the previous film.

It's not often I go to the theatre to watch a film, but I found it fitting to go watch this, as the last time I went to the theatre was to watch the first one.

I had beforehand decided to not watch any trailers and read as few reviews as I possible could, so I could get the full experience and not come in with an expectation.

In hindsight I now wish I actually had, so I could have saved myself the $60 the two tickets cost.

The film has issues - many issues.

The first and probably the most obvious one, is the artistic detour the writers, producers and Todd Phillips in the direction chair took.

I'm baffled about the how and why they decided it was a good idea, to turn the now franchise into a musical. And at that point, not even a great one. While I can see it was an attempt to capture Arthur's broken mind, it could have been done in so many other ways, which could have worded a lot better.

What we were presented with, is a prolonged Lady Gaga Music Video.

The character development is lazy and quite frankly both Arthur and Lee come off as terribly boring. Lee barely has much to say in the film, and the lines she does have doesn't really offer much to the development of the characters over all.

When it comes to Arthur, there is very little of him left in him. While I can accept that as a starting point of the film, had it revolved in him going back to his prime time as the Joker, it just never happened. Through out the film, we are met by the same empty and boring character with none to very little development.

When Arthur finally has the chance to shine, it's like seeing a totally different person, besides Arthur or the Joker.

When it comes to the story and the setting, the movie lacks a lot of the gritty setting and suspension the first film had. In many ways what we were left with was boring and I sat through out the film waiting for something to happen, that just never came.

There was way too many artistic freedoms taken in this film and I don't really find many of them a work of a genius.

For now, I shall forget this movie exist and just enjoy, that we at least have the first one and it actually details Arthur's descending into The Joker."
4.0,10 October 2024,"There is no traditional narrative structure. The film has no beginning, middle, and end. It is made up of a series of unconnected and repetitive scenes. The characters do not evolve or change throughout the film, and there is no conflict to resolve. The absence of a climax or resolution is intended to frustrate the viewer's expectations, generating a frustrating and endless very disappointed with what they did with this movie. Director producer everything is wrong. Nobody thinks about the fansexperience. You're wasting your time. You're wasting your money. Unless you want to watch a meaningless musical."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Let me just start things off as simple as possible and if you want to read the rest of the review, that's fine. This is the worst sequel ever made.

If you are a fan of that first joker movie and if you're a comic book fan in general... this movie hates you, and everyone that supported the first joker. This is a middle finger to an entire fanbase in cinematic form. Everyone that agreed to do this movie, including Lady Gaga, Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips, and all of the returning cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves.

I'm not gonna spoil the movie, but I have to be honest with you... Don't see this. Hes not even the Joker throughout most of the film, unless it some of the musical numbers OH YEAH BY THE WAY, this is a musical now. Also, the ending doesn't make any sense and it basically ruins not only this entire movie but the first movie as well. They're basically is no story by the way. Without the musical numbers, this movie would be 45 minutes long and to be honest with you with the way the story goes. There's no reason for this movie to exist. Literally zero. Also, they completely change Harley Quinn's character, And even the same character anymore in fact, they don't even call her Harley. Might as well have not even use her in this movie and just called her a completely different person and it would've been exactly the same same. Arthur Fleck also doesn't act at all like how he did at the end of the first movie and it kind of retracts back to how he was at the beginning which doesn't make sense because the whole point of that first movie is that he evolved into the joker. There's a ton of holes in this movie and people show back up and things happen in this that don't match up at all with the first movie. And I understand that they keep using the excuse that he imagines and always hallucinates things, but that can only go so far. This movie literally seemed like Todd Phillips made a fake script and sent it to the studio because he didn't want to do a sequel but the studio couldn't figure that out and they made him make the movie anyway and now he's being forced to make a fake script for a movie that he didn't wanna make. That's honestly how it feels. It really does feel like at the end though that this movie was an intentional , stab in the back to all the people that were fans with that first movie. Because it's so cynical towards not just the people that follow the joker and who the joker is, but also that a fan of the comics in general and also other adaptations of those comics. There's one Instance, especially towards the end, that is not only extremely confusing, but it's also just really disrespectful and insulting in general that makes it seem like the person who made this movie was genuinely trying to piss people off.

So yeah... I think it goes without saying at this point I did not like this movie. But I have to be honest with you. I have never hated a film more in my entire life. This movie has wasted my time, and my money, and Many many many months of not only being excited for this movie but also for the first movie as well and which this movie destroys coinciding. If you like the first joker, please do not watch this. This is without a doubt, my least favorite movie of all time."
3.0,8 October 2024,"I just watched this movie for the first time today, and I am very disappointed, especially after the first sequel, which was fantastic.

In the previous episode we saw how Arthur Fleck became Joker, the character building was brilliant, and it went to the top.

I was already mad about the musical format, It was absolutely not necessary, and we don't have to find out who is Arthur after the first movie.

The movie is declining from the beginning, the whole story is upsetting and kills the Joker character in general, with a disappointing end.

I wish I could leave a positive review, I just feel upset on how this could happen to the brilliant Joker character that Joaquin Phoenix played in the one of the best Joker movies.

It's a shame."
5.0,4 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a cinematic experience that truly defies expectations. If you're looking for a typical comic book movie, this isn't it - and that's exactly why it works. Joaquin Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck in a mesmerizing, gut-wrenching performance, but it's the addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn that takes this film to new heights. Their dynamic is electric, unpredictable, and at times, hauntingly beautiful.

The decision to infuse the story with musical elements may raise some eyebrows, but it fits surprisingly well within the film's surreal, dreamlike narrative. The musical numbers aren't just spectacle; they feel like an extension of the characters' mental states, adding layers to their descent into madness.

Visually, the film is stunning, with every shot meticulously crafted to enhance the dark, unsettling atmosphere. The score, once again, is phenomenal, intensifying the emotional and psychological weight of each scene.

This movie isn't for everyone - it's challenging, unconventional, and sometimes disturbing - but for those willing to embrace its uniqueness, Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and unforgettable journey into the heart of chaos. 8.5/10."
3.0,4 October 2024,"Honestly I used to raking into speak about all features script, directing, playing... and so many other points in order to give a raking a nice review but 4/10 this is the best raking that I can to give cause they wasted the movie with the musical theme too bad !!!!!!

The script it's very bad I expected a better story like the one even I knew there will have a lot of music scenes ok but so much like that !!?!??

Let it go it doesn't matter to speak anymore about it they wasted the project with Ty his weak script and this very bad Art Direction, a joker 2 like the 1 will be masterpiece ....

The only point this is still the directing, acting play from Joaquin and the soundtrack!!! Only good points from movie and all of these was great but only that ...

It would have been better to make no sequel at all, completely a wasting of time and money !!!"
5.0,5 October 2024,"I am a HUGE Joker fan and I have been looking forward to this for years! The amount of disappointment I felt was crushing.

Joaquin took over Heath's legacy with absolute grace. To me, Joker was a nearly flawless movie. I expected the same from this and it didn't even come close.

Joaquin and Gaga were convincing in their madness. They had me convinced of their insanity within minutes of the movie. Joaquin's acting was superb, as usual, but the script was so terrible that it didn't matter. In all actuality, Joaquin's performance was the only good thing about the whole movie.

If the rest of the movie mirrored the last scenes, it would have blown my socks off. My personal advice is to fast forward it to the last 15 minutes."

8.0,5 October 2024,"This movies is both amazing and yet it is probably impossible for it to not disappoint everyone.

I can't figure out myself if it's pessimism is the actual point , a mistake or a rewrite to prevent an uprising.

This movies proves how great of an actress lady gaga is and yet will probably kill her career as this movie is the second to lean or her singing ability to justify her presences. (I do hope she will get more chances to act and perhaps even not sing)

The visuals style of the movie is incredible and no one can deny that , but how far can you go with this alone.

The previous movie shown us how to create a hero out of a desperate person. This one might be showing us how society can destroy such heroes.

Still I do not think I like its pessimistic approach to everything and its defeatism in the process."

1.0,8 October 2024,"To me, Folie à Deux struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance, it lacks the emotional depth that made the first film compelling.

Lady Gaga shines as Harley Quinn, bringing charisma and nuance to her role. However, the chemistry between her and Phoenix feels forced and underdeveloped, leading to a lack of genuine connection that undermines the narrative.

The film suffers from poor storytelling, with a disjointed plot that leaves viewers confused and disengaged. It feels as if numerous scenes were cut, resulting in a fragmented narrative that fails to explore its themes of mental illness and love.

Visually, while the film is striking, it relies too heavily on aesthetics without providing a compelling story to match. The repetitive imagery and soundtrack do little to elevate the viewing experience.

Overall, Folie à Deux is a missed opportunity, despite Gaga's commendable performance, the film ultimately feels hollow, lacking the cohesive storytelling and emotional resonance that made the original so impactful."
4.0,5 October 2024,
5.0,5 October 2024,"I didn't expect Joker will be musical. To summarised the movie, ciggy, singing and dancing. No actions, murder or so. I expect something better than this. Can't take it especially the musical part. Not a fan of this movie. Probably will go for Disney musical if I'd like musical. For Joker, we expect some psycho stuffs like killing, violent like Joker 1.

And the most disappointed part was the songs, not nice and boring. I nearly fell asleep at the cinema. People were complaining, the person sitting in front of me, back and next to me. Some even walked out when they started to sing yet again. Pure disappointment."
8.0,14 October 2024,
1.0,2 October 2024,"Wow. What a movie. I know it's going to be very polarising but I LOVED every second of it. Can't wait to see it again. Lady Gaga was born to play Harley Quinn, talk about the perfect casting. Joaquin as usual delivers a powerhouse performance. The musical aspect of the movie can turn off some of the viewers but it added more depth to the story and its characters. It was so exciting to see both Joaquin and Gaga show their emotions through the songs. Might I say the sequel is better than the first one and that's a rare feat to achieve. Adding the musical sequences was a very bold move and I think Todd Phillip did a fantastic job. Now can we get a solo Harley Quinn movie next?"
4.0,4 October 2024,"In the first movie we saw how society turned a man named Arthur into Joker. For the second part I had anticipated that the we'll see Joker in his full power, scheming and doing mind tricks on people.

But to my surprise we come to know that becoming Joker was kind of a one time thing. It just happened, according to the director. Arthur just happened to kill all those people in the first part and has no plans for the future.

It seems that the director wanted to portray Joker not as a villain but the victim of an unjust system. It was weird to try feel sorry for a villain.

Also the movie is more about the courtroom than anything else. I kept waiting for an awesome ending like the last one, but couldn't find it.

There are some funny dark jokes, though. I might have been the only one laughing in the theatre, but I was laughing.

At the end of the movie I felt like I had felt after watching Hitler die in Inglorious Basterds, ""Th.. Th.. That's not how its supposed to happen."""
5.0,2 October 2024,"When you decide to make a sequel to what is arguably the best ""become villain"" film ever made, you're probably very confident in what you're doing. How confident Todd Phillips and the team were-I'll try to break down in my fresh pre-premiere impressions with a bit more analysis. When the film was first announced as a musical, it instantly received a lot of backlash. You might have already noticed the hate has grown even more after the pre-release screenings. While some think it's because of the musical aspect, I wouldn't fully agree. My friend Tarik, who joined me in the packed IMAX theater, did protest by wincing at the start of each singing scene.

The musical here operates largely on an abstract level, and as such, it's visually very pleasing and aurally effective in the context of Joker and Harley's ""madness for two."" However, since most of the musical segments don't really affect the plot, they feel unnecessary. The few songs integrated into the real-time narrative didn't convince me of their purpose, leaving the overall musical component as passable but far from what a good film in that genre should be.

Before diving into the plot elements without spoiling anything, I must address the film's title, which is there purely as ""bait"" to get you into the theater and spend money on the film. ""Folie à Deux"" refers only to the abstract part of the film, so if you were expecting wild and murderous adventures of Harley and Joker, forget about it. As the trailers suggested, the plot takes place in a prison, two years after the chaotic events in Gotham when we watched Arthur Fleck's transformation into Joker. Now, Joker is facing trial for what he's done, making the majority of the film a courtroom drama. But we've all seen good courtroom dramas, and ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" functions quite well in that regard. The drama is tense, filled with great dialogue and, I must say, humor. The film carries a wonderfully subtle humor-at least that's how I interpreted many scenes, though I can't say for certain whether that was the director's intent.

Like the first part, this film boasts visually stunning shots, phenomenal acting from Joaquin Phoenix, decent performance from Lady Gaga, and top-tier set design. Harley Quinn, portrayed well by Gaga, has little impact on the plot, which didn't sit well with me. On the other hand, Joker's psychological development is notable, something I found impressive at first, but it eventually ruined the film for me. Despite its flaws, this was a good movie right up until the end. However, in the final third, the writers take a narrative turn that reduces Joker to just another average socially distorted character, rather than the symbol of nihilism, madness, and chaos that he has always been. This is a shallow, misguided, and, to use a colloquial term, idiotic choice by the writers, further exacerbated by the film's conclusion. It's unlikely to sit well with even the most hardcore fans, and I really wanted to like this film.

In conclusion, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is not only an inconsistent sequel but also a completely thoughtless approach to the core idea this story should represent, leaving a bitter taste for all fans."
3.0,6 October 2024,"Okay, so I'm gonna get this straight, I never was particularly fond of this iteration of the Joker. Mostly because I'm a huge comic nerd and I can tell that the first movie wasn't so much of a deconstruction of the Joker character, but more so the exploration of a mentally ill man who just happens to refer to himself eventually as the Joker. Arthur Fleck is a deviation of the typical character and it's clear the Joker name was slapped on to get butts into seats. Beyond the name, it takes a lot of element from works evocative of Scorsese and smashes them down into a surprisingly basic and even somewhat generic story about someone falling into mental illness. Phoenix's performance is really what elevates the first film.

That being said, at least they tried something here. Not only is Phoenix's performance and Ladu Gaga's vocals the only saving grace, there are far more glaring flaws this time around. The pacing feels absolutely mishandled, Lady Gaga's performance(and her overall character as Harley Quinn) falls extremely flat, albeit Gaga can sing her heart out. The film feels extremely contrived, ESPECIALLY towards the conclusion(for those who seen it, they know what I'm talking about) and for as much as the first movie tries to raise some decent talking points with some cohesion, this sequel in comparison feels like it isn't sure what it's trying to convey. So much potential, but the execution leaves so much to be desired. Not what I would've wanted after waiting five years for a follow-up on Arthur's story, but ultimately not shocked. Once I heard about it being a musical and Lady Gaga(excellent singer but mediocre actress) being the lead, my optimism flew out the window. The irony is that like the first movie, the title is meant to attract audiences and as you can tell from Gaga's casting, they were really trying to pull out the stops this time. But I have a gut feeling this sequel is not going to have the same impact on any level like it's predecessor did. 3 out of 10. Can't rate this any higher."
3.0,4 October 2024,"Saw Joker 2 today.

Someone behind me as I was leaving the cinema summed it perfectly - 'It's not as impactful as the first.'

The first Joker was a gritty, uncompromising, nasty, tension filled and utterly unique look at a man's mental illness. Joker 2 undoubtedly shares those same qualities but to a far lesser degree, failing to reach the lofty heights of it's predecessor.

Joker 2 though isn't bad - it just feels as if it's lost it's way. I totally clicked with the intentions, themes and messages of the first movie whereas in Joker 2 I can't honestly say I felt the same way. I was left confused by what the film was trying to say to me.

What Joker 2 does do is greatly expand on the character of Arthur Fleck, yet strangely not in a way that felt satisfying. I kept wanting to know more or connect emotionally but the reality is I couldn't. I understood but I just didn't care. Joker built the character of Arthur Fleck up whilst Folie A Deux knocks the character right back down.

The stand out of Joker 2 are the performances. Phoenix is pitch perfect again as Fleck (if sightly less menacing) whist Gaga is not a bad choice as Harley but here is where one of my biggest points against the film stands - I didn't like their relationship. I felt it didn't really build or develop as naturally as it should and it definitely didn't go the way I expected it to. Although it's clearly not a film set in the typical Batman world, Folie A Deux felt like an outright betrayal of the lore of the world.

Maybe I went into Joker: Folie A Deux with too many expectations. But a film can disappoint your expectations and still be an excellent film - but Joker: Folie A Deux isn't an excellent film. IGo in expecting something unlike anything you've ever seen before and you may be pleased. Go on expecting a decent sequel to Joker and you'll be disappointed. I unfortunately have to not recommend it."
8.0,7 October 2024,
5.0,13 October 2024,"Look I actually really loved this movie. I think it was almost a shame to call it Joker 2 and market it as a DC movie, because most of the audience would have been expecting a more comic book inspired movie.

But that's just not what it was...

This film was a character study of a mentally ill man struggling to come to terms with his split personality. It's a film about society picking out his weaknesses to turn him into a monster that he never was and its about him coming to grips with the decision regarding which personality he wanted to pursue and make a permanent part of himself. Did he want to pursue the Joker, a monstrous and evil man responding out of hate to the hate society showed to him? Or did he want to be Arthur Fleck, the man he was made to be regardless of what society did to him.

The performance by Joaquin Pheonix was phenomenal, and while I felt like perhaps the musical element was slightly overdone, I really appreciated the bold and artistic decision.

Genuinely loved this movie and I think in time it is going to find its audience and get the love it deserves."
4.0,6 October 2024,"I watched the first Joker movie...like all the other guys here...so excited to see the second one.

And like all the other guys here i was slapped into my face when i watched the movie with 3 other friends inside the cinema.

As we we're watching the movie, i decided to check the feelings of all the other people around me: pure panic and frustration.

Like me they cant believe what theyve seen on the screen.

The movie was so bad that we four left the movie at the middle.

After that we we're able to see other people to do so xD.

Outside we we're getting in contact with the manager of the cinema...telling him how bad the movie is.

He told us that about 80% of the other customers also think that this movie is trash oO.

This movie ist more a musical....and not a good one.

Always singing...and singing...and singing....bruh.

So frustrating.

The only good thing about this movie is mr. Phoenix and his wonderful acting...thats it.

Really..he deserve an Oscar for that.

Lady Gaga on the other Side....forget it.

She should better stay on music than movies ;) I never left a movie at the middle...never ever....but Joker 2 die it xD.

My advice....dont watch it!

The budget was about 200.000.000..... How??????"
4.0,11 October 2024,"Complete disaster, and one of the most ridiculous aspects was the constant, pointless musical dance sequences that popped up everywhere. It seemed like every other scene was just an excuse for Joker to start spinning around or prancing through the streets, completely killing any tension or seriousness the film tried to build. Whether he was going down stairs, after a violent act, or even during his trial, the random dances made no sense and felt like desperate attempts to be artsy.

But beyond that, the real issue is with the producers and writers. They should all be fired for turning what could have been an interesting character study into a nonsensical, poorly paced mess. The script was disjointed, full of cliches, and instead of a deep, compelling narrative, it was filled with lazy, shock-value scenes that lacked any real substance. The producers clearly had no control over the direction of the movie, allowing it to spiral into this chaotic, cringeworthy spectacle. Everyone involved in shaping this movie made terrible decisions, and it shows in every frame. If you're looking for a serious movie, avoid this embarrassing flop."
3.0,9 October 2024,"This movie is so !!!BAD!!! That I think this was made on purpose: Never seen such a great job like the first one being destroyed, pulverized and spit at like this director and producers did with this sequel. Is not a musical, is not a crime movie, is no drama neither comedy. I honestly want the time and the money I spent watching this piece of garbage back.

This movie is just a lame excuse to have Lady Gaga singing, her character does not contribute nothing to the film at all, whatsoever. Most terrible movie at this level ever made.

I just do not know how the studio authorized this abomination."
3.0,5 October 2024,"It's a joke, a trash, an attempt to sooth the egos of narcissistic artists like gaga who can't act or deliver a dialogue so have to fall back to singing every single line incessantly and destroying the movie. Mr phoenix was absolutely amazing and so is the cinematography. But constant reliance on singing to move the movie (no story so can't say move the story). Harvey dent character was criminally undersea and when used, the actor played it soooo smug as if he's acting and fawning over himself infront of the mirror. It's a director's mess who gave into Gaga's pursuit of Harley quin and in turn gave away the movie. Watch it on HBO when it comes on ott as you can atleast skip nearly 1hr of the movie.

A case study for NYU to teach how not to self immolate due to some actor's narcissistic epiphany."
8.0,10 October 2024,
5.0,16 October 2024,"More original and brave than the first chapter which, let's not forget, was still a well-executed copy of Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy.

Well performed and absolutely justified are the singing interludes, which, despite being talked about, are not even that many. Overall, the transition between the film's three genres, from prison movie, to musical, to legal drama, is satisfying.

The story itself is enjoyable, and the ending leaves the door open to some, though improbable, possible future twists.

But the most interesting part is surely the consideration, or rather, the merciless judgement, that this film makes of its predecessor. The character played by Lady Gaga, fortunately, has not been included to build a Bonnie and Clyde story, but represents all those who loved the first film and who see the totally wrong idea they had of the Joker falling away, rightly so. Not a symbol, but a wretched person."
4.0,9 October 2024,"The guy who is responsible to turn this sequel into a silly pointless Musical, should be in jail!!!

Everytime I want to watch a musical I will lead myself to Broadway or Disneyland!!

I will try my best to make you all trully understand how high is my level of disappointment with a simple example: Imagine you on a random weekend, all excited because you are going with your kids to the cinema to watch a sequel of toy story or whatever, that you've waited more than five years to came out, and then the movie starts and you realise that the director or the executive producer have changed it and transformed it into a porn cartoon, or a horror movie instead!!!!!!!!

Please, I have an idea.... Let's just ignore this movie and call another director to shoot a better joker 2, using the same brilliant actors. Or use the same director but , make him avoid the errors that ruined this second part. You're welcome!"

4.0,6 October 2024,"The original Joker film was phenomenal, easily one of the best films of the last decade. It was gritty, captivating, and had a really an interesting plot, which really developed its characters. Everything Joker did well, Joker 2 failed.

Harvey Dent was incredibly lame, so much so that to call him a cameo would be a massive overstatement. His character just falls flat, and he just feels like an incredibly generic district attorney, it's kind of insulting to refer to his character as Harvey Dent.

Every scene in the original Joker was better than this film, there's only 1 scene in that could compare, and that was when Mr puddles was being cross examined by the Joker. It's so tense, and so uncomfortable and really shows just how far gone Arthur Fleck is

Easily the worst aspect of this film, is the complete deconstruction of Arthur Fleck. This films effectively retconns the events of the last film, and takes you back to where he started. There's pretty much no point to this film

And don't get me started on the ending........"
1.0,9 October 2024,"I put lot hope on this movie , another reason for this movie is ladygaga, I like her. But this movie draging too long, I understand the director wanna adding a lot of his opinion on this movie , but too much singing in this movie. Sometime the song came from no where, so embarrassing . I heard some guys in the theater shouting ""shut up"" when ladygaga started singing again. So disappointed. Whole story is very simple , this 'joker' not the batman's joker. This joker just had a tragic life, he was good guy. He killed some guys when his mind blackout, and the only girl loved her is mantally sick, just like bad side of him , and he end of death with stapping."
10.0,6 October 2024,"Amazon actors, horrible directing. No action, no story, was this a musical? (Not sure) Idk what the goal or point of this was but horrible storyline, horrendous ending and everything in between. You could've done a lot with this movie but man... If only you all could hear literally EVERYONE'S reaction at the end of the movie... save your money and time, just wait till it comes out on Netflix or something if you want to watch it, you aren't missing anything. The only reason I even gave 3 stars were because the actors, not the movie! I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it but please do yourself and all of us a favor and DO NOT try to make a follow up, a comeback, a series, anything! Unless you read every review before mine and after, take it into account and start over but firstly with a new director and writing team! Waste of a movie budget."
4.0,3 October 2024,"Unlike the majority of responders, I liked this very much! First a confession; I love musicals, even those of the dark and twisted sort like 'Les Mis'.

Where COULD the film go. What were the nay-sayers expecting?

For my money, Joaquin sang tunefully and, there's probably a good voice there were he to give up smoking for a month. (BTW the raspiness suited the part and was in sync with Lady Gaga).

Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors of a generation and suffers for his art. Lady Gaga was good and, I was delighted to see a couple of familiar faces from streamed series 'Industry' which has only just come to a satisfying conclusion on Australian screens. I predict actor Harry Lawtey, has far to go!

Has the way been left open for a Joker 3? That's the question the bookies are asking."
5.0,7 October 2024,"T wasn't horrible as everyone said. Of course, we expected more, but in the first movie, they portrayed his life in a miserable way and developed the character in such a manner that he reached his peak, so to speak. This development allowed the audience to connect with him on a deeper level. Then, in the second one, they didn't continue with that idea; instead, they made him miserable again and had him die as such, which felt like a regression. On the other hand, I understand the musical aspect because it tried to convey the complex mind of the Joker, showcasing his struggles and inner turmoil through song and performance."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I was watching the movie thinking, 'okay, this is great, I feel like I could watch it forever with how it's going.' I didn't have an issue with it being a musical, some bits were unneeded with regards to singing, but I enjoyed the film nonetheless. I was going to rate the movie an 8/10 with how it was going, the flow was great, some great actors in there playing decent characters, side characters were interesting too, then the ending came around and that just ruined it in my opinion.

Regardless of the story, Phoenix was amazing as always, the script was what killed the film and tried to make him look bad."

5.0,5 October 2024,"So...Joker ended up becoming a Catholic and all he wants in life is to get married and have kids? Wow. The director, in order to explain the nature of the Joker, ended up massacring one of the greatest characters ever seen in popular culture. Officially, from now on, the Joker is nothing more than a pathetic weakling who admits that he should have listened to the system. The character of the Joker as we know it after this film seems to have gone forever. Too bad.

Anyway, the actors did a great job. Considering her lifestyle, Lady Gaga fits the character of Harvey very well. I think that all the burden of failure unfortunately lies on the director's back."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Joker Folie à Deux is a prime example of how a highly anticipated sequel can fall drastically short of expectations. While the film boasts impressive performances and a commendable musical score, it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent and engaging narrative.

The Good (and it's mildly good)
Lady Gaga delivers a standout performance, showcasing her versatility as an actress
The musical elements are well-executed and add a unique flavor to the film
The overall production value and cinematography are of high quality
The Bad (and it's really bad)
The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear direction
The movie feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of delving deeper into the Joker's psyche while following the arc of the known story (for example how the Joker becomes more and more the known sociopath who perpetrates crime on a mass level) the film opts for a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying direction. It's as if the creators used the Joker's name solely for marketing purposes, much like the infamous ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter."" The film's departure from the established Joker lore is particularly frustrating. Fans hoping for an exploration of the character's complex psychology and backstory will be sorely disappointed. What could have been a fascinating character study instead feels like a hollow travesty. While the musical aspects and performances are praiseworthy, they're not enough to salvage the film's fundamental flaws. It's a shame to see such talent and potential squandered on a lackluster script and misguided creative decisions. Save your time and money for a more worthwhile cinematic experience."

It was so great seeing the Pig perform and do well, he really brought his sense of comedy and charisma to the silver screen. Ultimately I think casting someone as iconic and in demand as Tim Dillon was the right choice. The man is blowing up Paterson and many other social platforms. I think this without Tim Dillon this movie may have been a flop. I am very excited for what the DC future brings and can only hope that the directors and producers recognize the talent they had in their hands."
2.0,5 October 2024,"Except for the acting (which was great, given the talent), none of this movie worked.

Joker 2 is mostly about Arthur Fleck dealing with his split personality against the backdrop of a boring murder trial with no real twists or turns. There are frequent musical numbers which supposedly represent Fleck's imagination, but all of them are fairly boring and sound the same.

There's no action to speak of and no real plot developments. There's little-to-no references to Batman lore. There's no extravagant set pieces - almost all the movie takes place in a courtroom or in jail. The relationship development between Fleck and Harley Quinn is pointless and leads nowhere.

The budget of this movie was supposedly $200 million. HOW? This felt like an unpolished first draft of a sad attempt at a Broadway musical about a mentally ill patient."

Sending a message to all the kids out there watching that might feel alone, depressed or even victims of abuse, that we are alone in this cruel world and we just want the torment to stop, like shooting a horse out of mercy its way more dangerous than a joker that ""incited anarchy"" in the first place.

Irresponsable at best. Todd Philips wasted a great oportunity to send a moral message after all the abuse and violence experienced in these two movies. Instead, he promoted that we should just conform and give up on life instead of true redemption and repent from not only Joker but all his abusers.

Absolute garbage."
3.0,4 October 2024,"The world created in this film is insane. I've watched the movie during an early screening and from the very first seconds I was amazed. Cinematography and performances are incredible. Nice played fully to its strengths. Lady Gaga didn't have to prove her singing abilities but instead she embraced her role.

Truthfully it was not the best film I have ever seen, but for what I signed up for - Joker 1 with musical aspect to it - it was the best execution.

First musical for me that singing makes sense and highlights the insanity of joker instead of turning everything into a cheesy, fancy show. Check it out for yourself.

Majority of the people hated the movie before they even saw it, so don't listen to their based opinions.

Make up your own mind."
5.0,5 October 2024,"I am not a superhero fan, my wife is. When I went to the first Joker movie I was absolutely floored by how impactful it was. It was truly a masterpiece. Fast forward a few years and we get this self-indulgent overuse of what worked in sprinkles in part 1.

What I mean was that the scenes when the Joker was dancing and flailing were like 5 times too many in part 2. It was basically like beating a cinematic success to death. Lady Gaga and her botoxed glow and duck lips also kind of seemed a bit misplaced. There were times when Gaga and Phoenix had in screen chemistry, but they were so over presented to the audience.

One can only hope for a part 3 that redeems itself, but judging on past history of the majority of sequential films, the chances are low of that happening.

The cinematography, music (song selections) and lighting was stunning and effective, but the script just seemed disjointed and hollow. The entire film takes place in institutions. We want a Joker that is roaming free amongst society. This story robbed us of that."
5.0,4 October 2024,"I don't like musicals, never have. I don't like the music and I don't like that everything's always so incredibly over the top happy, I don't like that apparently everyone always knows all the songs and the dance moves and they just drop everything to ... sing and dance, almost as if their lives depended on it (this might make a fun horror movie). So when I heard that the sequel to ""Joker"" would be a musical, I was very disappointed. In the end I still watched it because I really enjoyed the first movie and a sequel, even a musical sequel, couldn't be that bad, right?

I've read complaints about the movie not using original songs. My reply to those: Originals songs wouldn't have worked. The songs in ""Folie à Deux"" actually have a point - I still didn't like them (not a genre of music I enjoy) but they actually fit the overall tone - without spoiling anything, this really is the Joker we know from the first movie but he's singing - and they never felt disruptive, which sets the movie apart from the few other musicals I've seen (glimpses of). There's even a scene that I enjoyed (Joker and the courtroom #1).

The image in IMAX was great (volume warning for the sentence!), Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga do a good job and while the sequel is sadly a lot tamer than the first one, it's still not even close to PG-13. So why the bad rating (I guess you could see 5 stars as a neutral rating)?

Do you remember the TV shows from the late 2000s and early 2010s? 20+ episodes per season, 20-40 minutes each. Eventually they couldn't come up with a new story, so they did a filler episode. Sometimes this was a flashback episode, sometimes it was a musical, sometimes it just had the characters running around in circles. ""Folie à Deux"" is the latter. The movie is almost 140 minutes long but there's basically no progress to the overall ""Joker"" story. Don't get me wrong, it's not boring (for me at least, others who expect a ""true"" sequel might feel a different way) but, apart from introducing Harleen and Harvey Dent, and a tiny origin story, there's no point to it. It's a movie that feels as if it wants to set up another sequel but it barely even does that.

The ending of ""Joker"" felt satisfying, the ending of ""Folie à Deux"" just left me asking: ""What now? This can't be it, right? Where's the rest?"""
2.0,6 October 2024,Suck's. It might as well be called a musical not a movie. As always the story varies too much from the actual D. C. world. Which is why I say it's a waste of time. Wait for it to come out and watch for free. Don't pay too go see it unless your just a Lady Gaga fan. Not sure who gave the OK to make but I felt lost from the beginning. I didn't love the first one but this one kills my hope of them ever getting these movies right. So grab a bunch of geeks from the comic book stores and get there approval before making any more of these super hero movies and stop making them into musicals. For the love of Batman.
10.0,6 October 2024,"After the great first movie, I didn't think I was going to watch a musical. Even I know and like 80% of the songs, I don't like musicals.

The intro and build up lasted forever and was tiring. Pretty much until exactly 2hrs in the movie. Then something happened, ... and everything was already over!

Acting was fine, but there was not much of a story, at least none that could not have been put into less then 40 minutes of movie time, and then move on with a story that probably everyone was waiting for.

What a waste of time! I should have checked IMDb before spending money on the movie ticket, in fact I should have listened to my Spotify playlist instead."
3.0,5 October 2024,"The first hour of this film was amazing! I thought the courtroom drama and the prison scenes were awesome, Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was great, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker was again phenomenal. The opening scene was odd, but I enjoyed it, definitely a different entry to these characters, especially Harley Quinn, which I was mixed on, the story was a bit muddled and lots of the musical sequences were unnecessary, I think I'll have to watch this again to get a final opinion, but this film has me mixed.

Tod Phillips I will forever hate you for that ending! It was so stupid, bad end to the character who went from on the bottom, to on top, then to the bottom, it brought in lots of new ideas that weren't mentioned in the first film that was unnecessary and unbelievably stupid. There was no point in watching this because at the end of the film you will walk out of the theatre, disappointed and left thinking what was the point in this film and the first."
1.0,5 October 2024,"I can not believe how many people are being so prejudiced towards this movie simply because it has a couple of songs in it. IF YOU CANT UNDERSTAND THAT THE SONGS REPRESENT MOMENTS WHERE THEY ARE TRULY INSANE THEN JUST GO WATCH TRANSFORMERS ONE, IT'LL BE MORE YOUR SPEED. I'm literally feeling insane that people are giving this movie such bad reviews when this is easily be one of the most creative, twisted, and surprising films of the YEAR. An incredible depiction of madness, and how the wrong person can bring out the worst in you, or in Arthur Fleck's case it brings out the worst person in you."
10.0,14 October 2024,
8.0,14 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" had the potential to be a masterpiece, especially after the first film, but sadly it falls short in multiple areas.

While Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an amazing performance as Arthur Fleck/Joker, his portrayal is the only thing holding the film together. His dedication to the role is undeniable, and his deep dive into the psyche of the character is compelling. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.

The storyline lacks the creative spark you'd expect from a Joker film. There's zero ingenuity in Joker's character development throughout the movie. It felt like the film was riding on the coattails of its predecessor rather than trying to push the envelope and explore new dimensions of the Joker's mind or his chaotic nature.

Lady Gaga's performance was especially disappointing. Her portrayal lacked depth, and at times, it was outright cringe-worthy. I honestly hope this will be her last attempt at acting because she nearly derailed the film. My rating dropped by 2 points solely due to her inability to carry her role.

The court sessions, especially after Joker fired his advocate, were dull and uninspired. These scenes could have been gripping and intense but instead, they were drawn out and unimpressive.

On the plus side, the film does a good job of illustrating how Joker's followers are growing, which adds an interesting layer to the story. However, this isn't enough to save the film from its flaws.

Overall, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is disappointing compared to the original. My final score is 4/10, and without Phoenix's acting, it would've been even lower."
9.0,6 October 2024,"I've been using IMDB for ages and signed up specifically to rate this film.

It is terrible. It's too long. There is no consistent storyline to be seen. What a waste of time. Three adults and three teenagers, all excited about Joker 1, ended up feeling somewhere between bored, frustrated, annoyed and at a loss. What does the poet want to tell us? My brother left halfway through the movie. If only we had all done that... The film is really long at 2 hours 18 minutes. It feels like it's twice as long.

I usually always check the reviews before going to the movies. But after Joker 1, I was sure I wouldn't have to do that for Joker 2. Blatant misjudgment.

We watched the original version, so it wasn't because of the translation.

The question remains: why? Never thought Joaquin Phoenix would give in to this strange non-plot. He is a great actor. And he plays the role well too! But the concept/script is so bad, there's nothing salvageable.

I don't know anyone who I would recommend the film to. Except someone who watches anything that has Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga in it. And I would warn even them."
9.0,8 October 2024,"I just finished watching Joker: Folie à Deux, and how should I put it? I love musicals, but they felt completely out of place in this movie. The shifts in tone were confusing, and one could even argue that they indirectly ruined the film. Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance remains as extraordinary as ever, while Gaga, compared to her roles in A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, came across as a bit lackluster. But it's not her fault-the issue lies in how her character was written. Her singing ability is beyond doubt, her performance seemingly effortless, and her voice very moving, but in the musical scenes, Phoenix clearly couldn't match her.

As a Batman fan, I couldn't feel any chemistry between Joker and Harley. Instead of Harley being the leading lady, it felt more like she was just a tool to drive the plot forward-and that plot was incredibly disappointing, especially if you loved the first film. The first movie showcased how a person from the bottom of society, bullied, oppressed, ridiculed, and tormented by various illnesses and childhood traumas, was slowly pushed into darkness and eventually descended into madness. In the second film, however, the focus was more on his confusion about himself and his uncertainty in facing the public's expectations. Sure, you managed to overthrow the city and start a revolution, but the crowd only idolized the symbol you represented. Once you take off the mask, no one cares about the real you. While the movie's message was still profound, the execution fell flat.

The first movie, in my mind, was flawless, a 10/10 masterpiece. But this second one? I can only give it a 5/10. It was that bad and that disappointing, and I sincerely wish they had never made a sequel.

That being said, I'm really glad I spent last weekend on a long road trip, looping Lady Gaga's latest album Harlequin at least ten times. It gave me some sense of connection to the musical elements in this film."
8.0,7 October 2024,"Seriously don't understand why this film needed a sequel. The film barely resembles the first film and undermines it at every angle.

The music is non necessary and tacked on. Gaga proves that she actually can't act. The plot could have been 30 minutes worth of a DVD extra.

Harvey Dent felt like a High School drama club member. The message, at the end of this overly dark and nihilistic adaptation of a beloved comic franchise, seemed all for naught.

It seems that the director wanted to say something but didn't know how. I think he should have said it in a different film and left us with the Joker that won an Oscar and won over audiences."
9.0,15 October 2024,"Absolutely phenomenal! A true masterpiece! I experienced this film exactly as it was meant to be seen-on an IMAX screen where it truly shines! Anyone who spread the word that this is a musical should reconsider ever speaking again. The movie is intense and unfiltered, offering a deep insight into the Joker's psychosis. It portrays him as a relatable individual, allowing us to see a part of ourselves in him. This film highlights the way we treat certain marginalized groups in society and the consequences of that treatment. The relentless victimization, even from those who claim to care or offer support, is profoundly impactful.

I won't spoil the ending, but let me just say-it's incredible! The entire film is simply amazing!"
8.0,8 October 2024,"Joker 1 was a refreshingly new take on Joker. Instead of turning him into a cartoon villain, no pun intended, it instead portrayed him as a deeply disturbed individual who was given a very raw deal in life and how that put him into a spiral of violence and madness. This movie had an excellent opportunity to continue this progression and turn him into the diabolical Batman arch-enemy we all know he should be.

But instead they made the asinine choice to turn it into a ehr... musical? For me such a choice could be only for one reason and that is to revert the expectations of the original fans and turn this movie into a joke, again no pun intended. Also, ignoring the boring musical parts, the movie just feels pointless. Half of the movie in an insane asylum and the other part in courtroom. Going back and forth trying to explain what he did in the first movie. But for what? We already saw the first movie and many felt it put Arthur Fleck into the path where he transcends his mortal form and become the immortal Joker. But this movie takes a u-turn and turns him back into Arthur Fleck and then ends his path in a brutal fashion.

This is a terrible movie which seems to hate its prequel and want to undo it. So I recommend skipping this movie entirely and just re-watch Joker 1 and use your imagination on how he transformed into Joker. Whatever you imagine it will be better than this trash of a movie."
10.0,19 October 2024,"This issue affects all movies since 01/01/2020, and especially The Joker 2. Underlit. Deliberately poor lighting. Not dark! It doesn't feel dark. It would feel dark, if it's logic was BRUTAL. Like in all movies of this decade, the logic is STUPID. Not brutal. Not dark. As a result of the stupid logic, the movie needs to be underlit. It covers up the smell of stupid logic. A stupid movie doesn't feel as stupid, if you turn down the light. To repeat the distinction, 'dark' and 'underlit' are two different things. All recent movies (with no exception) have plots sooo stupid, that you can't turn the light on. The stupidity would show. Compare this with the opening sequence of Star Wars 4 (1978). It shows the corridor of a Battle Cruiser space ship. That corridor is ALL white. As bright as bright can get. And yet it feels dark. Because the logic is so dark. The empire is about to capture a gigantic space ship by force, and they are succeeding. Dark! Despite the squeaky white corridor. All recent movies conversely are underlit. Stupid. Don't watch it. If the trailer is dark by means of insufficient lithing then no need to watch that movie. It can only be a stupid movie like The Joker 2. Or look at the production date. Later than 01/01/2020 = underlit = stupid."
9.0,6 October 2024,
10.0,5 October 2024,"After having seen this movie yesterday I can't believe how a movie as great as the joker could've gotten such a senseless sequel. The only positive aspect is Phoenix' acting ability. Lady Gaga's character is an empty shell without any character depth, development, or good acting.

The most annoying part is that just because there's Lady Gaga in it the main characters now have to sing forgettable musical numbers every few minutes. When she started singing yet again I could see people in the cinema rolling their eyes.

Above all, this movie does not really have an entertaining story and manages to convey almost nothing of interest in it's long runtime. I think it's an insult to the first movie and all DC and Joker fans to give us such an unneeded sequel that dies not add anything new to the first.

One of Joker 2 Quotes to summarize it perfectly: Stop always singing to me and talk to me."
10.0,5 October 2024,"The reason I am giving 10 stars is the fact that everyone here is rating the film based on their expectations. People went into this film expecting a film similar to the first Joker, and were disappointed. And, of course, the sequel is obviously not as good as the first, but it is NOT a 5/10 movie.

Joker: Folie à Deux is about Arthur's perception of the Joker. The musical bits were an authorial choice to convey his current mental states to the audience, and it worked. Yes, the movie is a bit slow, and there isn't much of a storyline, but I still was able to enjoy the film since it wasn't about a ""story,"" it was supposed to be about Arthur and the Joker himself.

Thankfully, I went into the theater with zero expectations, as should everyone that watches it. It is something ""new"" and enjoyable if you have correctly directed expectations.

My real rating would be 7/10 - acting was phenomenal, as in the first movie, and even though there was minimal storyline, it was still enjoyable to see Arthur's character development."
8.0,6 October 2024,"They've destroyed some very promising sequel that could've been , with a musical. Alienated the original audience that lauded the joker for it's intricacies and character development.

Lady Gaga is a singer, very good one but imo she is no where close to playing Harley Quinn. Who was she? Why is this movie titled Joker? Where is the insanity or character progress?

Joaquin is a great actor, but even his skills can't save a script written so poorly that ppl were yawning in the theater and probably waiting for the movie to get better, the better part never came and the hope eventually died.

This is a mess of ideas that doesn't fulfill the promise of the title. Watch at your own risk."
9.0,9 October 2024,"Lady Gaga claimed that Joker: Folie à Deux, wasn't a musical in the way that most other musicals use music. Repeatedly bursting into song constitutes a musical for me love! It crudely tried to frame the film within that surreal experience of watching song and dance. I can't abide musicals! The crossover into the medium of overly expressive music is lame. Arkham inmates might as well have been given a spoonful of sugar to help their medicine go down! However, this really doesn't work as a savy cinematography trick that's convincing of psychosis either-more like a meloncholy Gotham crossed with Grease. It's just not the one that I want. Arthur Fleck is a pitiful Joker. This killer is given that tiresome 'victim' angle from which he never transcends into the legendary supervillain. The only tie to the traditional DC Joker is face paint and a goofy laugh. It's a long, drawn out, boring, pointless sequel that leads nowhere."
8.0,6 October 2024,"Joker Part 2 is a visual representation of what it means to never meet your heroes.

Joker: Folie à Deux is more of a straight up drama that is still intense and delivers on the emotional aspect and stay rent free in peoples minds.

This movie is Excellent. It was a great experience watching it. I cant think of a better way to continue the Joker Story. If you think this movie is a Musical, you CLEARLY didn't understood the movie. You are in the head of Arthur, thats way he danced so much in the first one, now you are seeing it with him.

This movie is for people with higher IQs, not for single minded that wanted to see Joker suddenly skilled like John Wick and evil / strategic like a Marvel villain.

We got an A+ sequel."
9.0,6 October 2024,
10.0,4 October 2024,"Just came out of the local first night showing of the new Joker film - Joker: Folie à deux. What a film, an acting masterclass again from Joaquin Phoenix with brilliant support from Lady Gaga. No spoilers here, just get to watch it before you know too much about it and don't be put off by the negative reviews on here. This is obviously my opinion but it matches my daughter and son in law who watched it with me. Immersive and emotional, I don't often go to the cinema, only for special films and this was very special. I think the Oscars need not look elsewhere for Best Actor and best Supporting Actor 👏👏👏 #JokerFolieADeux."
9.0,4 October 2024,"An excellent film that contains incredible cinematography with atmosphere and emotion packed into every shot. The film continues on from the events in 'Joker' and focuses on the subsequent trial while examining the reception and interaction of the Joker with society at large. While 'Joker' allowed the audience to indulge in its fantasies, the sequel directly challenges these and calls out the hypocrisy and selfishness of doing so. Much like 'Fight Club' the film does an excellent job of criticising the hollowness and hypocrisy of the violent delusions of the disaffected, all while maintaining a sympathetic view on said disaffected. Much like the ending of 'Fight Club', expect many confused and angry reactions to this film.

The film continues with the bleak and difficult subject matter from 'Joker'. As in 'Joker' Arthur's fantasies grow ever more more elaborate and violent. The film covers difficult material but remains engaging throught with well thought out and creative cinematography and well written characters full of personality and heart. Without giving anything away, while the first film allowed the audience to escape into fantastical delusion to escape the bleak subject matter, the sequel brings all this crashing back to reality, exposing those who only wish to use Arthur's suffering to further their own agendas while caring little for the real person at the heart of it."
8.0,5 October 2024,"The first movie started with him talking to social worker the second movie I believe focused on the underfunded psych awards. The cinematography was on point And beautifully done.

Watching this movie gave me a new perspective on reality stars and watching bad toxic relationships on reality TV if people really want to understand why some of these people who put themselves on reality TV and try to have a normal type of love relationship, and you question what am I doing wrong? What is wrong with these people? This is a film, that gives you the inside look of what's really going on in these peoples minds that you watch in these toxic relationships. I don't know what people expect when they saw this movie, but I enjoyed it because we saw Author when he was talking to a social worker in the very first movie. This time we see him in a poorly fund psych ward. This is what you would imagine is going on in someone's mind that has gone through so much and caused so much toxicity, it makes sense to me."

9.0,4 October 2024,"It stripped of every power fantasy from the OG joker and every fairytale between him and harley, she only cares about the joker not Arthur Fleck, which makes Arthur Fleck's being still lonely and miserable but he accepts the adoption of his fantasy by Harley because it numbs his pain and feels good.

The power fantasies are stripped of but the movie is not empty because ofthat, Arthur Fleck still expresses power as Joker.

But all of it is believable and realistic.

That is where i can't believe what's done, because stripping the jokers story of supernatural elements, without stripping the core from the joker story and adding realism, while keeping the positive elements of the power fantasy and fiction would have seem like an impossible task for me.

But it has been done so on point, so precise, that i am here mind blown after the movie.

I also don't see any inspiration for any rampage done by identifying viewers, because even while keeping the positive power elements like hot girlfriend and being a rockstar and admired, it still is empty, isolated and said.

Which is a good transcript of reality.

Every step is another burden not a reward.

I have to say again that i think this is an unbelievably hard task to accomplish, but it is also what is needed for this topic.

Brutal honesty instead of Surpression or overly done power fantasies.

This is the mature joker movie who challenges you to look deeper into yourself, your shadow.

And yes there are Jokers out there and the horrible things and situations you see in this movie are happening to them.

So as none-joker think twice if you want to lend people a fist or a helping hand. Remember his ""on stage"" happyface and remember his depression when he is lonely.

(The part where he becomes joker again when his sad embarrassing life is analyzed in front of the whole court is also well done psychologically. Humiliation is something which just leads to more misery and to Arthur Fleck and all the Jokers out there to become more of a monster. Don't humiliate the people when they are trying to put on their ""happyface"". It's a cry for help and attention.)

PS: I also like the subtle psychological clues, for example at the beginning and the end of the movie about the shadow, or the theatre about Oedipus which tell a lot about the insight the creators of the movie have about this topic.

By the way the main point of Oedipus in psychology is not a sexual relationship or killing the father but a overly controlling mother who makes her child dependant of her and helpless which leads to the oedipal dream of killing the father and to become the partner of the mother, not with the goal to sleep with her, but with the goal that she never leaves you because now you can give her also the only thing her child can't give to her. A partnership.

But dependancy leads to aggression that's why he kills her.

In reality most Matricides are also commited largely by their sons with the Oedipus Disorder.

So please don't feel disgusted about this topic if you identify with Arthur."
9.0,2 October 2024,"Throughout the movie, we might've been thinking that they will build the mountain, the highest one that everyone expects. I do not even think the ending will be like that! BRILLIANT! 🤡

The way the tone color changes every time the Joker is around or the fantasy they live in is very clever. It makes you question everything about what happened in the courtroom when the final statement happens. You can see that Arthur/Joker having a difficult moment thinking about who he is. Everyone around them just simplifies him as just Arthur or Joker, even Lee. It shows how complexion in human physiology are."
9.0,11 October 2024,"I love the movie because the point of movie was not Joker as a person but being clown in society that is waiting for someone to start anarchy and it rly show how people are next to you only when you are ""something"" (in this case clown), also her love is here only to show herself how she is with someone who is popular and hero in others eyes. Only after he realise he is not Joker but some random Arthur guy she leaves him... same is in real life with ""heroes"" and ""clowns"" people are here only when you are cool and when they can use you for their own benefit and promotion. Musical part is only about 20 mins of movie in total of 138min and it rly is not a musical... Him singing only shows his mental part that he signs only when he is happy and it is not often... I think generally people stick too much on Joker (DC Joker) and not on the point of what Joker represents in society and world we live in. Love it!"
10.0,2 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux: is nothing short of a beautifully twisted journey into the psyche. This film was not what I expected, it shattered all preconceived notions of a typical comic book adaptation. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver deeply captivating performances, pulling the audience into a world that's as chaotic as it is hypnotic.

The film dives far beyond the surface, packed with subliminal messages and moments that linger long after the credits roll. It's not just about the Joker or Harley Quinn; it's a dark and intricate exploration of madness, delusion, and human frailty. There are layers of meaning here that make it more than a comic book movie, it feels like a commentary on the human condition.

This isn't a movie that will make you comfortable; instead, it challenges your perceptions, twisting familiar characters into something far more unsettling. Yet, in that discomfort lies its brilliance. Folie à Deux goes beyond expectations, presenting a hauntingly beautiful narrative that sticks with you, and pushes the boundaries of comic book storytelling in ways few films dare to attempt."
10.0,5 October 2024,"I went into this movie with the understanding that it probably wouldn't surpass the original, and I have to say I was largely satisfied with the production overall. The filmmakers did a great job maintaining the spirit of the first one, capturing much of what made it special, even if it wasn't perfect. The only real critique I have is with the pacing of the movie. It felt rushed at times but other than that I had no issue with the other aspects. People should really manage their expectations better when going into this movie. It was never gonna top the first one but in no way, shape or form did it undermine the original."

Ok yes there's lots... LOTS of singing. Musical ?? (As everyone says) NO !! Lots of singing ? Yes. After 30 minutes I genuinely thought I wasn't going to get through it.

But I did.

It's very good.

DO NOT expect this to be like the first Joker. If you do, you'll hate it. Phoenix and Ga Ga and brilliant and the story makes more sense the further on it goes and draws you in.

So many people saying ""what was the end all about"" and ""I just didn't get it"".

It's really not that difficult.!

This movie is 'different'. Again, it's NOTHING like the first so don't expect it to be and you'll find yourself enjoying it."
10.0,9 October 2024,I'm sorry I don't get the hate. I went in thinking it's going to be rubbish and it was a work of art. In a world where kids can't watch movies anymore all that watch is YouTube shorts. Or where all super hero movies are predictable oh look there's a bad guy and in the end we are going to kill him and win! This was fab. It was eerie. It was weird. It was uncomfortable it was literally art. Are people jumping on a band wagon and hating it? Or are people so closed minded they want rubbish? This is a good movie. It's like living in a weird warped warped fantasy. Maybe the haters just don't get it. I loved it I want another one. I love Arthouse and this is what it was.

10.0,15 October 2024,"Here's your review translated into English:

---

I haven't been so overwhelmed by the formula and freshness of a comic book-based film in a long time, but this one licks the comic through triple gold foil. Did I like it? Yes. Did something irritate me? Indeed. But in 10-15 years, this film will return to the internet on lists of the ""TOP 10 most underrated movies ever."" What is it? For me, it's a prison-courtroom drama drenched in a musical, addressing the mental issues of the protagonist, who causes a social sensation as an accidental symbol of rebellion. However, as an Arkham resident without makeup, he is dismissed and labeled a psycho deserving of the electric chair. This underlying, cynical play on the protagonist's emotions to wind him up and ignite him, creating the best version of himself in the process, is brilliantly executed - the hero's tragedy sometimes evokes a smile, sometimes consternation.

People hated the sequel because they didn't get an obvious continuation made for 200 million dollars. This sequel is precisely measured based on the ending of the first film, while also playing with the narrative through music. I recommend it because it's something totally different, ambitious (even hyper-ambitious), and devoid of the mannerisms of a typical blockbuster."
9.0,5 October 2024,"It is so refreshing to see such a production that demonstrates a complete command of the medium witha team of actors that are willing to put it all on the line. It is not for everyone, but those brave enough are in for a rare treat!

You know you are in the hands of a master film maker and a cast that gives themselves over 110% to his talent and displays their own with nor fear. I was blown away by Joaquin and Lady Gaga! It is well known that I hate classic musicals- but this is not that animal- If anything, the musical aspect truly shows the depth of what is apparently Arthur Fleck's true mania. But that 50% of the movie is awe inspiring.

Joaquin gives it all in when he turns into the vocal Joker with a mic, and the passive quite Joker-in-love when without one. His last renditioninto a pay phone is heart wrentching! I was waiting for the full-blow musical flip in the film, but it never comes.... instead we explore Arthur's mind and his new found love interest.

The addition of the venerable Brendan Gleeson as one of the old-time guards is amazing as always.

If you loved Joaquin's JOKER movie performance, you will love this film. I sincerely hope he gets an OSCAR nod. The songs are carefully dealt with in all their fashions, and the underscore is truly haunting and appropriate. There is one scene in the trailer that is not in the movie and that did bother me. This has been happening lately. But overall this is a rare movie experience."

Perhaps it's because I expected it to be filled with non-stop singing, which I feared would be terrible-but I was pleasantly surprised. The story was truly engaging, and I felt connected to the characters throughout. The performances were well-crafted, with each actor bringing something special to their role. The pacing was perfect, and the music complemented the narrative beautifully. The film takes you on a journey that keeps you invested from start to finish. I didn't feel bored for even a second. Highly recommend giving it a chance if you're skeptical like I was!"

A twist on a typical comic book movie where the focus becomes the underlying theme or motivation of the character (mental illness).

Lady Gaga is phenomenal.

The use of music was ingenious. It's an internal film where the lead is forced to go because there's really no where else to go. It's a device and a smart one. It's another way to tell a story that gets closer to the emotion then you might with dialogue.

I loved it. Bravo all involved."
9.0,5 October 2024,"If Todd Phillips and Scott Silver had to make a second movie for joker, this was a perfekt way to do it. Without saying much, this movie really comments on all the criticism the first one got. The ones that dont like the new one, is exactly a point in it self. And I fully understand, because the first one was phenomenal, so people are sad about ruining the first movie, that's less clear in its message, and therefore more up to the individual and personal analysis. The second one is way more clear, and that might be annoying for some. Anywaayy, please try to understand the message it tries to prove, you will enjoy it a lot more!!! And people just love to hate musicals, thats all. The hate here is too much man. I mean come ooooooon. It is great!!!!"

8.0,5 October 2024,"I feel compelled to defend this film, given how its brilliance has been overlooked by those expecting a typical comic book adaptation.

This is not just a movie about a villain-it's an intricate exploration of Arthur Fleck's mental illness, psychosis, and dissociation. His character's fragility is at the heart of his journey, showing how society can break someone suffering from mental illness, driving them toward a darker identity.

The glamorization of his descent symbolizes something much more ominous. Arthur was never intended to be the calculating, sociopathic Joker we're familiar with, but rather a tragic figure who becomes the catalyst for the ""real"" Joker. The decision to frame the movie as a musical mirrors his fractured mind, turning this film into a psychological odyssey instead of a straightforward origin story.

The Joker's backstory was always mysterious, deliberately chaotic, and constantly shifting-this film embraces that concept and executes it masterfully.

AND AS IMPORTANTLY!! How can anyone watch Joaquin Phoenix's performance and think this film deserves anything less than three stars? SERIOUSLY?!?

***!***SPOILERS BELOW***!***

His portrayal of Arthur, with every raw emotion etched into his expressions and every sung note, is nothing short of Oscar-worthy.

Yes, his death is truly heartbreaking, making it difficult not to deduct points, as it feels like an immense loss. However, if this is the conclusion, and we as viewers are meant to bridge the gap between Joaquin's Joker and Heath Ledger's through our own imagination-two PEAK performances in their own right-this film unquestionably deserves a perfect five.

But that's just my OPINION yo!!"
8.0,13 October 2024,"Wow!

It's surprising how many people assumed Joker 2 would be bad without actually seeing it. Hearing all the negativity made me more eager to watch, and I was blown away. The movie is deep, with brilliant acting and stunning cinematography. Phoenix deserves a Best Actor nomination. It left me with so many thoughts-nothing is black and white, and there's always another perspective.

Maybe there was 1-2 songs to much but with besides that the music did a great job telling the story even deeper. With that said it was a great movie and the perfect sequel to the first film. I can highly recommend this movie!"
8.0,14 October 2024,"Actually, that works as a recap of the plot, but I mean the insipid and arrogant reviews. 5.3? Are you kidding me?

I loved Joaquin's original Joker and this is a profoundly meaningful dive deeper into his personal trauma and the emotional space around him. Lada Gaga's Lee Quinzel is brilliant. I admit, I'd have paid just to hear her sing her bits here. But both give nuanced, textured, emotional performances.

As for the music, if anything it's subtle and organic. I don't hate musicals, but Folie à Deux manifests none of the typical musical contrivance. Hell, I'd have been okay if it leaned in there. But people's whining about the music is off-base, to say the least.

I suppose it ""lacks"" the kind of violence and ""action"" a philistine consumer might desire, but I found its pacing and introspective thoughtfulness well-matched to the material. Go play a first-person shooter, if that's what gets your rocks off. Are the rest of us not entitled to the substantive nature of a movie like this every now and then.

What people seem to hate about the movie is that it's not what they expected and doesn't conform to mainstream sensibilities. As far as I'm concerned, that's part of why it's so beautiful.

The thing I ""didn't like"" about the movie is that it often made me sad and frustrated about the human condition. But I kinda think that's the point."
9.0,17 October 2024,"I felt really depressed before I saw the movie because there were so many negative reviews, even from film experts I really appreciate. However, I wanted to form my own opinion. Today, I watched the film in the cinema, and it was GREAT. The film took me deep inside. Many call it lazy; I call it a masterpiece. If people say the first Joker was great but the second wasn't, they didn't understand the first Joker at all. If you don't like both Joker films, I can accept that, but don't say the first was great and the second wasn't. If that's the case, it's just not your genre. Go watch Harry Potter and the stone of mainstream! Joker 2 has an outstanding character, but maybe you have to be a bit of a freak like I am to appreciate this piece of art. It was great, but I can only give it 9 stars because the powerful mainstream is overshadowing my true opinion!"""
8.0,6 October 2024,
10.0,4 October 2024,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made about the collective human subconscious driving fate. The acting is very subtle and personal, the script is very well written. The characters have their completely parallel worlds, and the result is a mix of fate. Exceptional high IQ movie, even the musical parts increased the emotional investment of the audience. It's basically a prequel to the real Joker character and it needs multiple viewings to really get why picking up the crown is not for the weak. Overall an underrated movie that reminds me of the psychological dramas of the 90s. Cannot recommend it enough!"
10.0,19 October 2024,"This film is definitely misunderstood.

I love how it explores the complexities and turmoil of mental health. The psychosis of the Joker - the gregarious, unrestrained showman and fantasist - is perfectly represented by the musical level, with the dark pain of Arthur Fleck languishing in a world without music and flamboyance. The two levels are bridged by Arthur's desperate infatuation with the equally disturbed Lee.

It's feels like the bad reviews stem from a misunderstanding of mental health and also the narrative devices of the musical. I strongly suspect that in time this film will be recognised as a cult classic."
10.0,13 October 2024,
10.0,7 October 2024,"I loved the movie. As a huge comic movie fan I too was dissapointed that is was not the sequel it was expected to be. But, if you just watch the movie as cinema enjoyer, you will see a very poetic, gritty, musical drama. And this was greatly written as a possible sequel still. Even when it was not expected to be like this. Todd Howard still made a wonderfull movie. The musical parts give the movie a unique style. It is a beautiful written movie, that again shows a lot of what can go on in the minds of people who are misunderstood. Also again great acting from Joaquin Phoenix.

The sequel we did not deserved, we still got."
10.0,2 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is a film that surprises with its boldness and originality, with Lady Gaga delivering an impeccable performance as Harley Quinn. Her vocal and acting talent blends perfectly with the dark, psychological atmosphere of the film, making the character complex and captivating.

Gaga skillfully balances vulnerability and madness, offering moments of pure emotional intensity. Her scenes with Joaquin Phoenix are engaging and full of tension, enhanced by musical numbers that never feel out of place but instead add a unique touch to the story. A film that stands out thanks to Gaga's performance, an essential addition to this fresh take on the world of Joker."
9.0,5 October 2024,"First things first, I walked out of a film I bloody loved. I've heard complaints about why people disliked it, and all I have to say about those complaints is that they are just dumb. I'm not going to talk about the complaints because they may evoke spoilers, but needless to say I massively disagree with them.

Secondly, for anyone worried, it's a film with musical elements. It is NOT a fully fledged musical.

The film is about Arthur Fleck and his relationship with Harley during his criminal trial for the events of the first film. The trial story, while central to the film, is the lesser of two parts. This is a film about a relationship between two mentally unstable oddballs and how it impacts them and their lives throughout.

Phoenix continues his awesome work as the central figure, trying to navigate a world that doesn't understand him, all while knowing that there are people who idolise him because of his crimes. The effort he puts into this character make me a little ashamed of the lack of effort I ever put into any of my own acting. This performance is just as strong as the first film. Gaga is a really interesting take on Harley. All of the base elements we love about her are there but Gaga plays her so differently to anyone else. I throughly enjoyed this version of Miss Quinzel.

Todd Phillips has done a great job continuing the story of Arthur Fleck, while doing so in a way that feels really different to the original, but never (for me), in a bad way. The cinematography, sound and direction all blend together seamlessly to create a vision where reality and madness intertwined, and at times become difficult to tell apart.

Overall? I loved this film. Is it flawless? No, but it was (again, for me) pretty damn close. It's a DC Elseworlds story that features musical elements. It's simply not going to be for everyone. It was for me...4.5/5..."
10.0,10 October 2024,"I'm stunned at some reviews of this film and wonder if some reviewers are missing the point.

This is a study in mental illness and society's reaction to it and celebrity generally. Thought Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck/Joker was mesmerising again and surprised at Lady Gaga's acting talent. Enjoyed Brendan Gleason as one of Arthur's guards and was particularly impressed by Leigh Gill as Gary Puddles. This is not a musical either; the songs more of an explanation or illustration of inner turmoil.

This is a film definitely worth seeing but do what we did and rewatch the first film before you go."
10.0,8 October 2024,"To me this film seems like a triumph, a great victory, I greatly admire the courage of its director, its scriptwriters, its stars, The great and bold Joaquin Phoenix, The wonderful singer Lady Gaga, the beautiful Catherine Keener, and as always Brendan Gleeson is a marvel on the screen.

I am very sorry that people are not understanding this ugly jewel, that they do not accept Todd Phillips s vision without compromise, and that they do not understand Larry Sher s masterful use of color.

However, what I enjoyed most about this film was its resounding denunciation of the profound iniquity of its predecessor."
10.0,8 October 2024,"The movie Joker: Folie à Deux presents a dark & deep dive into the mental health issues of Arthur Fleck and Harleen Quinzel. Every single moment of insanity turns into a great & dark musical number. The soundtrack is 10/10 and the performance of both Joaquin and Gaga is incredible - you can feel their delusion and madness everytime they start performing another song. The movie is deffinitely not for everybody, but the hate on it seems really forced. If you liked the first one for the right reasons, you will deffinitely enjoy the second part as well. I wish some of the leaked scenes made the final cut."
9.0,12 October 2024,"Who actually thinks, that they hire Lady Gaga, in a movie with no signing? The people who have walked out of this movie, saw the title, had a brain shutdown, went to the movies, did not like it, beacause there is singing, walked out.

The movie is great, not the best, but absolutley not horrible. The signing makes sense to me, it's in his head and in his little boble of fantasies.

The only thing I think is a bit «staged» is the constant refrences to music, like the guards say «its showtime» and the over explanation as to why there is music in the movie. The music should have just stayed a fantasy in the Joker's head.

Lady Gaga does a fantastisk job btw, and so does Phoenix aswell.

Have an open mind, there is not 40 songs in the movie, like some articles have claimed, threre is maybe 10% singing, the story is not told with singing. And to the people that does not like musicals, don't go to a musical and do a bit of research before you go to the movies."
9.0,12 October 2024,"The first joker film , I really never took too. I watched it 3 or 4 times , but I found the obvious, and wildley triggering narrative too much . I didn't like it , but found it a piece of art that was still a solid film. I found this better. However , unless you have experienced mental health on a level that is massively severe, i doubt for 1 second you will even begin to grasp this . I found this way , way better than the first . But , I've served time in psychiciat wards. I've been around the comics , I've suffered delusions , supposedly, and ultimately didn't meet the girl of my dreams , blah blah. I watched this with a friend who I was helping (as I'm a qualified therapist now) and. We have just had sectioned and is staying with me. We both found it , 'brave' completely mis interpreted and totally apt to those born in the system. Brave film, completely mis understood. Awesome piece of film."
8.0,5 October 2024,"This film is fantastic.

The acting, the story, the musical elements are all great and all used to take us on a deep diver into the chaotic and fractured mind of Arthur Fleck. It's an exceptional exploration into how a character/persona created to help a man cope with mental illness goes on to influence the disenfranchised masses of Gotham. The Harley Quinn plot is great, sad & heartbreaking.

All leading to the ending which perfectly bridges the gap from Arthur Flecks Joker, to the violent and brutal Joker Heath Ledger so fantastically portrayed.

Phoenix & Gaga are exceptional and I would expect some academy award nods. The cinematography & score are top draw too.

Don't get the hate this film is getting. I think people are completely missing the point. Go in open minded and you won't be disappointed."
9.0,5 October 2024,
10.0,4 October 2024,"The story of Joker and Lee got me crying a lot! Gaga is so amazing! She played so well that I felt in love with her character! There was just a perfect amount of music in the film. It was a real pleasure to watch the whole movie in the theater. I'll definitely will rewatch it to see more details and understand it better. Beautiful picture, great cast, amazing music, isn't that what we all need? I guess this time Gaga showed the crazy side of hers, and it was good! ""Let's give people what they want!'"" No more words! This is the best movie of 2024. Lady Gaga should definitely get an Oscar for that role."
8.0,5 October 2024,"The story is more complicated than most of us was expecting. The only thing I want to say is those of you who were disappointed by the story are just like those people in the court that leave the room after Arthur says it was simply him, that he didn't want to do all hi's done.

We don't want to see about a human being that suffer the mental illness, we want to see one more show based on comics. I think the second part speaks more about society than the first one.

The end of the movie shows that now whoever can be Joker, whoever can do it the way he wants, but especially whoever can commit a crime behind the mask."
8.0,16 October 2024,"While the first ""Joker"" was a good psychological thriller drama - I really didn't see on forehand how a follow-up would be super interesting or even possible to deliver in a good way - I was floored by this demented masterpiece. Even darker than the first movie, but balancing with the journeys into the main character's imagination. A radical move back to real international cinema of the golden days. Very much anti Hollywood in general but very anti streamline cinema in particular. Yes, it qualifies as a musical - but remember, this is about a demented entertainer. The entertainer who puts on a mask to survive and to be enough in a harsh reality. A beautiful piece of cinema."
8.0,6 October 2024,"The movie delves deep into the heart of what the Joker represents-the embodiment of the marginalized and the miserable. In a way that echoes the grim humanism of Hugo's novels, Joker captures the unsteady decline of a fragile mind, using subtle visual cues and increasingly eerie music to mirror the unraveling psyche. When reality comes crashing down, it doesn't hold back.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers a phenomenal performance. His portrayal of the Joker is haunting, with every glance and gesture speaking volumes where words fail. The story is a tragic one, a slow-motion catastrophe that feels preventable-but only if everyone had been someone different that who they want to be. Instead, we witness the train wreck of a life that leaves the viewer to decide how much of this is due to the nature, and how much is due to nurture.

One of the most interesting aspects is the depiction of Harley Quinn. She's no longer just an unhinged sidekick or eye candy. Here, she's portrayed as a manipulative, toxic thrill-seeker, a wealthy woman who relishes deepening the wounds, daring to think she is experiencing the same trauma as the least fortunate. It's a fresh take that deepens her character.

If there's one misstep, it's the continued demonization of people with split personalities, a common trope in films that could have been handled with more nuance. Nonetheless, it remains a powerful exploration of mental health, societal neglect, and the thin line between victim and villain."
8.0,15 October 2024,
8.0,8 October 2024,"Almost didn't go based on the reviews but we had already bought our tickets. Thank goodness we went and saw it on the big screen!

Joachim Phoenix is arguably the greatest actor of all time in my books. This performance was one of his best that I have seen. Simply amazing!

We loved the cinematography, the direction and the script. There was nothing to dislike about the movie in our books (4 of us thought the same) Lady Gaga is a very good actor. She was the perfect person for this role alongside Phoenix.

People complain about the music - we had no idea why as it complimented the story line perfectly.

I honestly think that people have been influenced by the negativity of the critics. Go see it for yourself and enjoy acting like you rarely see in Hollywood movies nowadays."
9.0,6 October 2024,"You cannot watch it seperately from the first part and together they show a developement kind of like the first two movies in Nolan's Batman- trilogy. Whereas the first part is the awakening of the Joker, the second part explains the ups and downs of Joker losing his laugh and completely losing it. I loved the folie à deux, because it made me feel the torture of Joker physically. And yes, I am too empathic and I can understand what drove Joker and actually why he cannot meet Harley's or his henchmens' expectations. He never wanted to start a revolution, well until now. I sure hope for an end of a trilogy, but the end of the movie is also fullfilling.

Lady Gaga did a very good job, exceeding my expectations. Joaquin did an amazing job. The Harvey Dent character was underdeveloped. Did I miss the coin? We see the face damage, but was it enough to turn him to Two-Face as in Detective Comics #66 (August 1942), where he appeared first.

What is a folie à deux. Wikipedia says: Folie à deux (French for 'madness of two'),also known as shared psychosis or shared delusional disorder (SDD), is a psychiatric syndrome in which symptoms of a delusional belief are ""transmitted"" from one individual to another.

Lee and Arthur shared their depression even the desire to exit the stage. But in my opinion the psychosis spread to the other inmates of Arkham..."
9.0,14 October 2024,"I couldn't think of a better follow up to 2019's Joker. It was sublime. Think about what made Joker a success. It subverted expectations by giving us a different look at what Joker could be. It was original. Joker: Folie a Deux is, again, original but unique in presenting the fantasy world that Arthur Fleck has created and then blurs the lines by bringing Joker to life when he most needs him. Gaga is magical. Although we've come to expect amazing things from her voice she brings a subtleness to Harley that shows the over the top version has it's place but isn't always appropriate. Joaquin Phoenix brings it again and although we had less compulsive laughing than Joker (1) we had an even more nuanced performance that gave a glimpse into what mental illness and the blurred line of the human condition means in a world that is constantly unexpected, to say the least. He makes you want to root for his character despite the awefulness he contributes to a world that is somehow more evil than he is. Todd Phillips gave us the most beautifully directed movie of his career. Whereas Joker (2019) was a heavy homage to movie of the 70s and early 80s, specifically from Scorsese's Taxi Driver and less obviously The King of Comedy. The sequel reveals a more original story and concept that fits with the first but stands strong as a second. Audiences and critics that scorn the movie for being different may not remember what made Joker so amazing in the first place. Its originality, story, characters, scenes, designs, shots, etc. Made 2019's Joker a success and we should appreciate 2024's Joker: Folie A Duex for the same reasons."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I came into this movie expecting it to suck like everyone had been saying and walked out not only being surprised, but actually loving it. I feel bad for people who missed the message and see it as a flop.

All the ""normies"" who think this is a musical are actually just getting a glimpse into the mind of someone with mental illness and the way their mind creates fantasy. In this movie we see a new side of Arthur as he experiences someone wanting him FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE"". It's no wonder he feels like singing.

And additionally I love the idea that the Joker isn't a person but a movement. It's a terrifying wild fire that Arther set ablaze that is rooted in chaos. It's not about Arthur."
10.0,11 October 2024,"While the first Joker film was a deep character study focusing on isolation, despair, and the violence that arises from a fractured society, its sequel ventures into an entirely different thematic realm, centering on love. The decision to introduce musical elements, although bold and risky, blends seamlessly into the narrative and enhances the film's unique atmosphere. This time, we witness a more romantic side of Arthur, whose emotional depth stands in stark contrast to the demanding and domineering character of Lee. The interplay between the two leads is compelling, offering a fresh take on both characters. Sadly, the film's negative reviews seem misplaced and do not do justice to the final product, which delivers a thought-provoking and artistically."
9.0,16 October 2024,"""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is nothing short of mesmerizing. The sequel to Todd Phillips' 2019 masterpiece takes the original's gritty, psychological intensity and elevates it into a bold, operatic experience that's both visually stunning and emotionally powerful. This film is not just a follow-up-it's an evolution.

Joaquin Phoenix once again proves why he's one of the best actors of our time. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck/Joker is even more layered and complex here. Phoenix captures the torment, fragility, and madness of the character with chilling precision, making it impossible to look away. The addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn is brilliant. She not only holds her own alongside Phoenix but also brings a fresh, electrifying dynamic to the screen. Her transformation is gradual yet powerful, and their twisted chemistry is captivating.

The musical elements, which could have been a risky choice, actually work incredibly well. Phillips intertwines musical sequences with the narrative in a way that feels organic, yet hallucinatory. It's a striking blend of realism and fantasy, reflecting the fractured mental states of its characters. The songs don't just enhance the mood-they're part of the storytelling itself.

Visually, Joker: Folie à Deux is stunning. The cinematography is rich with colors and contrasts, capturing both the decaying world of Gotham and the vivid, fever-dream world inside the characters' minds. Every shot feels meticulously crafted, with a haunting score that lingers long after the credits roll.

While the film is dark, it's not without moments of dark humor and poignant commentary on society's treatment of mental illness and its underclass. It builds on the themes of the first movie but takes them in a new direction that feels fresh, daring, and unafraid to challenge the audience.

In terms of pacing, it may not be for everyone-Joker: Folie à Deux is slow-burn, with an emphasis on character and atmosphere over traditional action. But for those who appreciate psychological drama and character study, this is a thrilling journey into the depths of madness.

Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a rare sequel that expands on the original while standing firmly on its own. Phoenix and Gaga deliver career-defining performances, and Todd Phillips crafts a film that's as beautiful as it is disturbing. A must-watch for fans of the first film, and for anyone who appreciates daring, visionary cinema."
10.0,4 October 2024,"The plot is a vehicle for the message and theme about comedy as a coping method and the disappointment others experience when seeing the real person behind the mask. The musical psychosis is the delivery mechanism. Writer-director Todd Phillips has been a comedian/filmmaker in Hollywood for many years and broke from that role with the first Joker. His career and feelings are on display again with this sequel that chooses art over cheap thrills.

It all makes sense if you think of it that way and not as a comic book movie that should continue the legend of the Joker.

Great acting and art direction. 4/5 because some of the songs were too long and uninspired, but overall a great experience if you go in with an open mind."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I thought it was excellent. Without giving too many spoilers away. The courtroom drama and it's finale were absolutely gripping and right on point for our times. Don't believe the bandwagon of hate, go see it for yourself and keep an open mind. The chemistry between GAGA and Fleck works beautifully, and what is real or imagined is explicitly shown throughout. However, even aspects of this are open to interpretation.

You're gonna love it, or hate it. Just don't listen to what the paid critics say, or the bitcoin youtuber.

If you love a psychological drama, with an unhinged story this is for you."
10.0,11 October 2024,"I absolutely Loved this Joker film and I'll probably see it a few more times to fully appreciate its pure darkness. It's a film about the human experience and struggle, not all blue skies and puppy dog dreams. Extremely thought provoking.

The acting was incredible, Joaquin Phoenix should be, at the very least, nominated for best actor. Lady Gaga killed it too, I'm so impressed with the roles she chooses. It almost seems as though this script was written with her in mind.

It's essentially a very dark theatrical musical, many broadway aficionados will appreciate the evolution of this musical masterpiece with an immensely challenging topic made for the big screen. I laughed and cried. I Loved the duets, it seemed like Gaga almost had to notch down her musical prowess in order to make her character believable yet it was a beautiful match to Joaquin's musical ability.

Ignore the one sided reviews and go see this film...."
8.0,6 October 2024,
10.0,4 October 2024,"I really enjoyed Joker (2019) and it's my favorite movie by Todd Phillips, but it is also a movie that shouldn't have gotten a sequel. Unfortunately, it was announced that this movie was coming out and I was puzzled by it. Then, all of the reviews came in and it has been divisive, even more than the original. So, I just finished watching Joker: Folie a Deux (2024) and while I had a great time with the movie, I also have to say that we were right about not making a sequel to Joker (2019) in the first place.

Positives for Joker: Folie a Deux (2024): I will say that the movie's plot centering around Arthur Fleck being on trial for what happened in the first movie is very interesting. Todd Phillip's directing is still on point in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix is still great as Arthur Fleck/The Joker and he is even crazier in this movie. I also really liked Lady Gaga as Lee Quinzel and her dynamic with Joaquin Phoenix is very entertaining. The musical numbers are pretty good for what they are. And finally, the final act of this movie has some entertaining moments.

Negatives for Joker: Folie a Deux (2024): There isn't a reason for why this movie should exist because the first movie was designed to not have sequels, but Warner Bros. Didn't get that their heads. I also don't understand why the movie was even marketed as a musical in the first place. And finally, the last 20 minutes of the movie did not sit well with me and it definitely confirmed that this movie was indeed entirely pointless.

Overall, Joker: Folie a Deux (2024) has a lot of entertainment value to it, but it is another one of those sequels that should not exist."
10.0,9 October 2024,"This film is visually striking and emotionally charged. The animated introduction sets a vibrant tone. The cinematography is simply beautiful, with rich colors, dynamic close-ups.

The editing is excellent, especially the slow-motion sequences and the parallel editing during the intense court trial scenes. Seeing it on IMAX was an even more immersive experience due to the aspect ratio changes, which is a unique visual storytelling technique that I loved.

What makes this film feel different from a typical sequel is that it acts like an epilogue. It explores Arthur's imagination, contrasting how he sees his world and how society views him. The ending is devastating and ironic, using upbeat music in a way that feels intentionally contradictory to the film's darker tones, which left me with mixed emotions.

Hearing the Joker theme again was refreshing; I appreciated the variations and layers added to it throughout the film. While it repeats, each iteration feels intentional and impactful.

The music selection was fantastic. In this film, music feels like Arthur's lifeline - it's his way of finding hope. His emotions are powerfully channeled through music; it strengthens the film's atmosphere.

Sound design is one of the standout elements. It's so well-mixed, using techniques like sound muffles and silence at the right moments, which makes the visual storytelling even more impactful.

Joaquin Phoenix delivers yet another masterful performance as Arthur Fleck, bringing out the complexity of the character. Lady Gaga, while a bit odd due to her recognizable voice, decently fits into the role of Harley Quinn. I initially had my doubts, but she worked well for this interpretation of the character.

One minor disappointment was that some scenes shown in the trailer didn't make it into the final cut. Those moments could have added something extra, but overall, it didn't take away too much from my enjoyment.

Overall, this is not an action-packed film but a slow, dark, and thoughtful exploration of Arthur Fleck's character. Todd Phillips shows a lot of experimentation in this film, and I admire his bold vision. I'd comfortably give it an 8/10 for its artistic vision, performances, and emotional depth."

Third, this movie is great! It picks up from the first movie and goes in a direction many people missed. I was not a fan of this movie when it first started and then I understood everything, except the ending. If you don't get the movie, you just won't get it. There are plenty of references that point to what is going on and why. This is a Joker movie that is overshadowed by negativity and people are missing out on a great movie and great acting. If you don't know the Joker character, then you have not been paying attention at all."
10.0,13 October 2024,"I went to this film with my son and we are both fans of the DC franchise. After the film I had a conversation with the cinema manager. She told me the film had not done well at her box office although she liked it. I asked, so what was it that people disliked. She said that it was a musical. Was it? I thought it was a journey and exploration of the mind and personality of an abused child who as a man was schizophrenic - a term never used in the film. We both thought the musical interventions were entirely inappropriate with some marvellous set pieces and songs, well delivered, which helped to illustrate the mind of Fleck and his place in his world. The performances were excellent and styling of everything was top tier. For those that said they didn't like it I would say you just don't get Arthur or how his mind works. Try it again."

At first I was a little bothered by things like cartoons or songs, but once got past the ""face value"" and started reading into metaphors, lighting, angles, went deeper into the WHYs, I saw everything connecting. And from there on, the songs spoke so much more, especially the lyrics. I almost did not want to blink the entire movie not to miss any details that complement the story. It kept me on my toes where I was second guessing if what I understand is in fact how it was intended. Not sure if I got all the answers, but I'm sure they're there. Definitely would go again to see the details I missed. This is not some simple ""friday night movie"" and I think it might be too deep for some people."
9.0,13 October 2024,"Brilliant! Carries on the story of the Joker perfectly. The musical numbers fit seamlessly into the film and are brilliantly preformed. The only weak link is probably Lady Gaga, her vocals in the songs are weak compared to Phoenix. It's a great addition to the DC universe and adds to the lore of the Joker smartly. The first movie was pretty good but this surpasses it for drama and suspense. If anyone wants an introduction to the character of the Joker and his motives and personality, this is the perfect vehicle for that. Completely re-watchable. Can't recommend this enough to DC fans. Groundbreaking and bold."

10.0,2 October 2024,"This movie was perfect - even better than the first film, in my opinion, which is a tall order to meet. I especially thought that Lady Gaga stood out as Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel. Perfect. No notes. Her chemistry with the obviously-incredible Joaquin Phoenix - who won an Academy Award for his first turn as Arthur ""The Joker"" Fleck - is immaculate. Who knew they would mesh so well together? My only critique would be: there isn't enough of her in the film. Hopefully they remedy this by giving her her own spin-off movie. There is one scene in particular that stands out among the rest... Those who have seen the movie will know the one that I'm talking about.

Great job to all involved!"

10.0,9 October 2024,"A movie about mentally ill person failed by the system, in the Batman universe, in the POV of Joker, singing and dancing in the rain. If you didn't expect this movie, not sure what you expected. Very well executed. They pull the rug from under the audience at the end, I think that turned most people off. Joker POV movie, with room to move on afterwards. Watch the first one before rolling into this one, it makes total sense. Better than the French Olympics opening, makes just as much sense. Someone nominate this for an award, they'll be looking back on this one as it's own genre. Nailed the late 70s early 80s psych ward feel. With songs."
10.0,12 October 2024,"Just watched Joker: Folie á Deux.... Wow...wow wow wow wow. The people that didn't understand this film really need to watch something other than blockbuster mainstream media. This was THE BEST movie I have seen ALL YEAR. As someone that has struggled with pretty serious mental health disorders their whole life, the first film really hit me. If you paid attention in the first film you would know that Arthur's uses music to escape his reality...Folie á Deux actually showed those fantasies he was experiencing. I have always used music to help me cope with life so I understood this incredible artistic choice that Todd Phillips and Joaquin made on a visceral level.

There were so many incredible artistic choices made in this film that blew me away. It was soooo beautifully shot. The acting was incredible. The set design. The sound design. It all weaved together perfectly. The opening is a cartoon of Joker that perfectly set up how the film was going to go. There's an incredible shot of Arthur being walked through the rain by guards and from the front you see black umbrellas, then they do an overhead shot that shows rainbow umbrellas and that shot immediately had me hooked into the story.

I love Joaquin Phoenix because he has ALWAYS made bold choices as an actor. He has always strayed away from mainstream sterilized roles and scripts and chosen to take roles that make you think. And I respect that so much. If you're a cinephile, do not listen to the negative reviews of this film. Go see it...go see it right now!

And as a bonus, I listened to Lady Gaga's companion album 'Harlequin' when it came out and I loved it. But I was confused by some of the song choices. After watching the movie I love the album even more. Every song chosen was absolutely perfect."
8.0,13 October 2024,"My take on Joker Foile à Deux keeps the same vibe as the predecessor. A cautionary tale of one's struggle with sanity. When you push someone so far they will break. In a sad dark world the only thing one may say is we have song and dance, understanding this I completely see the genius in making it in to a musical. But this is not a happy ending movie and or feel good time. Extremely sad and maybe that's what we all need to see to just treat one another with a kind word once in a while. Wow the performances was amazing written beautifully. It really doesn't deserve a horrible reviews it's been giving."
10.0,15 October 2024,"It's less of a Scorsese remake, more original, darker and is frankly better than the first one.

It's a shame that people are going to miss out on this film due to what seems like an agenda. Too many film makers are hung out to dry for not putting out the same film twice and trying something different.

It requires some thought and maybe a few watches to completely understand. But it has been completely misunderstood and deserves a better reaction.

Phoniex gives a deeper performance this time around and the musical segments do serve a greater purpose. Lady Gaga does a fine job as well along with Gleeson."
10.0,7 October 2024,"Amazing Movie! I think it went over alot of people's head. If you put yourself in Arthur's shoes and try to understand the complex feelings, it hits the needle on the head! Plus they both sing amazing, what a great duo. Alot of people's are saying it had no story or where was the story. Are you kidding me.... Joker is a complex mentally Ill character, there's ALOT of complex feelings that go into understanding a character like that. And that's where the story developments and better understanding of the complexity of the Joker.

Arthurs feelings of finally having someone who wants him, Cue the first song and man what big feelings were those, Almost brought me to tears. Then comes the complex feelings of wanting to be this person everyone wants (Joker) but kinda tired of it all, tired of being angry and hating everything. Which is bought on by Harley cause all he feels like he needs is her not this anger and hatred and reminder of what sad life he's had. But....... dum dum dum.... Harley ain't want him unless he wants to burn it to the ground with her. And the ending....oh man... I feel like it can lead up to the dark knight situation. Picture this he goes to the hospital realizes that if he ain't got Harley might as well burn it all down, takes advantage of all the people who will do his bidding and burn Gotham . They left it wide open for many possibilities. Point blank if you missed this movie you need to read a chapter on emotional intelligence and then rewatch. It'll all click."
9.0,5 October 2024,"I heard a lot this movie was a ""musical"", but clearly people don't know what a musical is anymore.

The minute I saw them signing I knew it was all in his head it's so obvious and pointed out it's one of his delusions. I loved this movie the way it references to the mistreatment of people who are ill and the way people view them when it comes to their breaking point, as well as the system failing to protect them from the trauma they face as children that would obviously affect them growing up. I think people over hated this film imo people don't know how to actually watch a movie. Media literacy is dead I suggest you all watch this movie again with some empathy and logic. This isn't some ""action"" movie with badass joker it's an actually joker who suffers from his disorder and trauma."
8.0,5 October 2024,"The first film clearly portrayed the essence of the Joker, a fragile figure with certain limitations. Harley Quinn saw in him a relentless leader, without remorse, a symbol of courage for a disillusioned society. However, as the cracks in his conviction began to show, Harley's fascination gradually faded. Vengeance does not elevate us above those who harm us. The film speaks to an audience no longer concerned with justice, but with retribution, an audience without dreams or a future, whose only hope now lies in the hands of a new Joker-one who, unlike Arthur Fleck, will know no regret, Knock, Knock!"
8.0,17 October 2024,
8.0,7 October 2024,"Most comic book films are shallow and empty of feeling. The first joker broke that mould to giving us a deeper connection with the character.

Joker 2 hits in just that way again, I was rooting for Arthur every moment. I felt happy, I felt empty, I felt warmth, I felt. The point of the film for me was not action or to watch a fantasy adventure, the point was to connect with the Arthur and Harley.

The musical and surreal aspects add warmness and escapism to the films depressing themes, which is exactly what Arthur is experiencing; it is another way which we connect with the character.

The film feels like the shawshank redemption meets la-la land meets miracle on 34th street. If you like that and give it a chance, you are the right audience for this film. Unfortunately, I don't think a majority of the gotham audience are the target here and I believe that's whats causing these brutal reviews. Joaquin, Gaga and Brendan put on incredible performances and should be proud of what they have created. This film and the first will be classics one day when we look back, and Im glad the two are so lovingly crafted."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Do not play around with myths and icons. Andrew Dominik's Blonde has been partially marked with the sceal of infamy for the same reason.

""Joker : Folie à Deux"" is a brilliant movie. I could read in other reviews :"" A slap in the face of the Joker fans"", ""A waste of time and money"", ""An insult to fans intelligence"". An insult to fans intelligence? No. On the contrary, it is an insult to fans stupidy, their intellectual, narrative, dramatic pavlovian reflexes. The ""Joker"" movie was not warmly welcomed by all DC fans because it also twisted Batman mythology's arm. But, the story, its structure, the drama crescendo was classic. Phillips and Phoenix chose another path this time. Against all plain expectations and odds. And that, for most, is unforgivable. Would a ""classic sequel"" have been a bad choice? With an adolescent Batman (many probablly dreamt about that) or God knows what? Of course not. But once again, it is simply not the choice that was made. And I thank director and main actor(s) to have made that decision. It gives us a crepuscular movie, reflecting in its direction and editing the madness of a man, for whom songs is a ""mental"" way of illuminating a desperate life, a way brought by a woman singing, the first time he sees her. Fleck will try to hang on to love in order to, out of darkness, come back to light. It is also the portrait of a man who wants to escape madness, and might pay several prices for that. ""Joker : Folie à Deux"" is a darker love story, an unusual courtroom movie, barely a musical in fact, a bright movie, full of emotions also. I'm not gonna go into details in order not to spoil anyone, but it shows a sense of subtlety all the way. Yes, definitely more difficult to savor than the first one. So what? Don't you enjoy the pain that goes with practising your favorite sport? A major studio gave us an unexpected movie 5 years ago. And instead of repeating the same pattern, the studio has been brave enough to give us another unexpected movie. Audience should make the intellectual effort to refrain from projecting onto a movie everything they expect it to be or not to be, and enjoy what its makers want to tell us. And see all its beauty. Hats off!"
9.0,7 October 2024,"I walked into Folie à Deux with a heavy heart, bracing myself after reading the crushing reviews here. Yet, to my utter astonishment, what unfolded on screen was nothing short of breathtaking. It was as if I had seen an entirely different film than those who gave it a single star-ONE?! Are you kidding me?!

The story-oh yes, there is a story-was not just one, but a cascade of narratives, each more tragic than the last.

It's the story of a man thrust into fame for being something he never was.

The story of a society so beaten, they seek solace in a broken soul to lead them.

It's the brutal tale of mental illness, suffocating under the iron grip of a police state.

The story of power, corrupted and abused.

A surreal (and, yes, a bit too musical) story of an abused soul encountering someone having hybristophilia.

And the most gut-wrenching story of all: a system that not only failed him at every turn but drove him to the brink, punishing him for snapping instead of healing the wound at its core, addressing the underlying issue, the system itself.

This isn't just the story of one man; it's the story of all of us. And that's the tragic brilliance-it's not a comic book fantasy. It's a reflection of our world, raw and terrifying in its truth.

I could go on about the brilliance of the acting, the haunting soundtrack, the stunning cinematography-each element, flawless. But honestly, that goes without saying. This movie is greatness, pure and simple."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux transcends the boundaries of a typical sequel and delves even deeper into the fractured psyche of Arthur Fleck. Todd Phillips brilliantly merges psychological horror with musical elements to create a haunting yet captivating experience. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is once again electrifying-his portrayal of the Joker is layered, complex, and disturbingly human, while Lady Gaga's presence as Lee Quinzel is nothing short of a revelation.

The film's use of color, sound, and choreography transforms Gotham into an almost dreamlike, chaotic landscape that mirrors Arthur's unraveling mind. Every scene feels meticulously crafted, pulling the audience into the swirling vortex of the Joker's insanity. The bold narrative choices pay off spectacularly, making Folie à Deux a daring, compelling continuation that both complements and elevates the original.

This is a film that will linger long after the credits roll, offering no easy answers but leaving viewers with a profound sense of awe and unease. A true triumph of storytelling and artistry-simply a must-watch... for non-simpletons."
8.0,7 October 2024,"While I see some people don't like this movie. I loved it. I think the musical aspect was used in a very smart way to show the alternate personality of Arthur that is Joker.

I think we are bombarded with nonsensical movies nowadays and movies like Wolverine vs Deadpool which have very little intellectual thought put into it does well and Folie a Deux has a much lower rating.

To me it shows the reality of this world that is also shown in this movie. We live in a superficial world with superficial thoughts and people can't seem to just get the point of deep thought. I would personally recommend this to anyone and well if they don't like it. They just don't. Seems to me they are all upset over having their expectations broken rather than enjoying the true masterpiece of art that it was.

As someone mentally challenged, the movies makes even more sense. They found a brilliant way to show his delusions and hallucinations. That was through music and casting Gaga. Phoenix and Gaga are amazing together and I suggest everyone watches this with an open mind!"
10.0,8 October 2024,"Joaquin and Gaga were amazing. Both showedperfect acting in this sequel and have proven to be the right picks, it's a match made in heaven.

While a lot of people do not like the musical aspect (which i truly can understand, looking at the kind of movie the first part was), i think it really shows the 'folie a deux'. Furthermore, the negative reactions kind of prove the point in the movie: people only care when there is spectacle, being the joker, and do not care about the humanbeing and his mental state, arthur, himself. I think Todd managed to set up a movie in which exactly the same happens as in real life, which is kind of sad but very strong as well."
8.0,6 October 2024,"I really enjoyed this movie. Like i enjoyed first groundbreaking film. Do you know why? Because it was just a continuation of the first movie. Down-to-earth, sincere, which makes you feel in the place of the main character. And a musical! A musical that gives more meaning to words that reflects the natural behavior of every human being. After all, as they say: when you are extremely happy, you even want to sing, and when you are unhappy, you want to express this emotion in every possible way. I will eagerly wait for the 3rd and further parts of the film, because I think this is just the beginning of a great epic that has captured the hearts of the audience with its down-to-earth characters."

10.0,7 October 2024,"When I became aware of the bad reviews for Joker: Folie à Deux I did not bother to read them. I know that when it comes to reviews I tend to hate the movies that get glowing reviews, for example - Late Night With the Devil (an absolute waste of time) I don't need to be spoonfed films, I can use my imagination, and even though I do have ADD, I don't need films to punch me in the face continually. Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck (Joker) with undeniable striking talent and screen presence, with Lady Gaga as Lee Quinzel shining just as brightly, and forever more reigning as Harley Quinn. Her ability to embrace mental illness all-encompassing was mesmerizing, from the look in her eyes to the pallor of her skin, to the condition of her hair. Her insane fan Girling for the Joker was demented and scary. Witnessing Arthur Fleck struggle with the need to feel wanted and be true to himself was watching him on his course of self-destruction. Knowing his gut was telling him, warning him, but he just had to keep touching the open flame. The use of the musical scenes to denote his delusions was brilliant. All Arthur aspired to be was a performer, it only seemed fitting that his delusions be illustrated that way. The original Joker film, I found had almost a musical undertone to it. No there was no bursting into songs, but it was expressed in Arthur's movements, that at times were like Expressive dance. If you truly loved the first film, I can not see why you do not love this film just as much. Even the ending was sheer perfection, I don't want to put any spoilers in here. But if you haven't seen the film, make sure you watch carefully and keep an eye on the background.

Joker: Folie à Deux does not deserve bad reviews, people need to open their eyes and use their brains more. Don't let the bad reviews stop you from seeing this film. I know I am definitely going back to the cinema to see it again. I truly hope that Phillips does not give up on the DC universe because of the haters."

10.0,14 October 2024,"Todd Phillips really takes things to a new level with this one. It's not just a follow-up to Joker; it's an evolution. Joaquin Phoenix returns with an even more disturbing portrayal of the Joker, fully embracing his descent into madness. But what really stands out is the addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. Her performance is captivating, adding a dynamic that feels both dangerous and tender.

The musical numbers are unexpected, but they work, giving a surreal edge to the film. The cinematography is also stunning, with Gotham looking darker and more alive than ever. Phillips manages to blend chaos with beauty, crafting a psychological thriller that's also a tragic love story. It's not just a comic book movie anymore-it's something deeper."
10.0,8 October 2024,"Not going to do a long review as there are many good ones I agreed with listed by those who enjoyed it. I found the movie entertaining and beautiful visuals, great musical pieces and I'm not a huge fan of musicals.

The story for me was a full circle movie for Arthur from being a beat up clown in an alley to the end shot. Loved how Arthur's singing was not great in the gritty scenes but were god in his fantasies. Lee was a great character and kinda wish she was in it more.

I loved the first Joker and this was a good continuation of the story to me. Didn't care for the split personality defense, I think a mental health person snapped would have been better but split personality followed the me and my shadow theme."
8.0,5 October 2024,"This is Arthur Fleck's world and we are living in it. Wonderful character study. The movie brought tears to my eyes multiple times, there is immense emotional depth to it. Love is portrayed beautifully as well as what having mental health issues is actually like: not a fancy story, just sad and many times, hopeless.

The musical moments add to it, they are it. It is not annoying as I usually find it with traditional musicals.

This is also not your traditional, commercial Joker. The Joker here is laid bare for the world to see his true nature. The movie is about one person's demons and having to face the consequences of his own actions. And making a choice. Truth or Lie.

It is rare that life offers us the necessary elements to fulfil our desired narrative. While in the first movie, life was quite tolerant of Arthur's narrative, in the last one, the story gets real, and life senseless (or at least not with the sense we hope to give it).

The soundtrack is still haunting my thoughts as I write this review."
8.0,12 October 2024,"The word disappointment probably appears in more reviews here than the words Joker or Harlequin. But this film was not a disappointment to me. Why not? I suspect mostly because I went to see it knowing full well it was a 'jukebox musical'.

Strangely enough, I watched the first Joker film on a whim, expecting a DC superhero (anti-hero) film. I left the cinema agape, blown away by the power of the film and the strength of the performances.

I went into this cinema this time having read the reviews and the seeming disbelief that the hard-hitting grit of the first film had been followed up with a musical.

I must say, though, that I left the cinema after watching the second Joker film equally impressed by the performances, and equally impressed by a film that once again breaks convention."
9.0,10 October 2024,"It's tough pill to swallow, because it's far away at what people want from The Joker. It's far away from the original movie, but it's way better than original. In first movie we see his actions in other hand in this one we see his inner though, his persona , his illness which is shown through music and songs. Somewhat dark lyric, helplessness in his voice. There's almost zero action outside, but inside it's different. Extraordinary casting and play. Unbelievable cinematography it's beautiful and dark, raw at the same time. Extraordinary movie for people who abstracts from original one. Must see but forget first movie and open your mind."
10.0,4 October 2024,
10.0,5 October 2024,"It was such a tragic story of a mentally challenged, abused person. And it was portrayed to a perfection by Juaquin Pheonix. I agreed songs can be trimmed but nonetheless it was a perfect.

My only issue is with the in some moments abrupt initiation of songs when there was a serious moment and i wanted to get mote to it and suddenly song will start.

Lady GAGA hods on her own in this film and I hoped some scene should have been cut which explains her character more which was showed in film.

Going forward i hope James Gunn will continue the vision of Todd Philips for the Villans and their solo films."
8.0,5 October 2024,"The ambiguity of the first film takes a leap down La La Land with this follow up. Again, all of the conversations are mainly centred around standout lyrics from songs and musicals to cast the presumption and possibility that there's really no physical dialogue actually taking place. The vocal performances are fantastic but especially from the untrained, broken and vulnerable tones of Joaquin Phoenix. The sound design and score was again on top form, as were all of the arrangements. Whilst some sets were obviously designed to embrace the fantasy and fanciful style of classic and lavish musicals, there are occasions where it is the lighting which plays its role at transforming whatever the 'real world' set is into becoming a mindful grandiose stage. I think it will alienate a lot of the audience (there have been multiple and numerous groans from people every time another song begins), but thankfully I did get the majority of the reference points, so again, loved the performances.

I think I've invested myself into a potential backstory of the character enough to be able to tell this fictionalised version of fantasy and reality to just be happy to let the story unravel itself, whereas if you are presuming to take it all at face value then it will feel disjointed."
8.0,9 October 2024,"Go watch the movie as it will take you on a journey through pathologies and it will leave you with a weird and quirky feeling of ""why am I feeling empathy towards a human being that is the image of turning the human being inside-out?""

Splendid acting from Phoenix and Gaga and incredible directing. Scenes roll out in a festival of allegories.

The music is just enough to push the point of a possible silver lining in the mad man's world, ""even a crazy bird will sing"" but not enough to turn it into a musical. The bad reviews for this movie come from people who went to see it with a marvel mindset, it was pretty clear from the first Joker that this is a mistake."
9.0,11 October 2024,"This is a masterpiece. Once again, I feel that viewers' opinions are completely unreliable. While it encapsulates past classics like Dancer in the Dark and Chicago within itself, it also destroys the image of the Joker from the first movie. (In my opinion, it's akin to the liberation in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.) This film takes the next step toward redefining the 'villain' figure. While there are many negative opinions, it's clearly stated right from the opening sequence, isn't it? However, it's frustrating to think that so few people in the world can grasp such complex characters anymore. Throw away your phone, you idiot. Pay attention to people. Idiot!"
10.0,15 October 2024,"This was a deep dive to humans cruelty and suffer. Music was the small get away from it. Every time, you feel uncomfortable, sad or happy or any kind of strong feeling, movie has reachead it's goal. All sugarcoated movies has their place but that's not all. As allways Joaquin made it. Lady Gaga was playing her part well as a very twisted woman. Enough unexpected turns. The more time goes by, the more it's getting richer in many ways. No for fun, but for hope in any ways. I presume, their is also a cultural gap between us here, in nordic countries. Us known as ""nordic noir"" movies and series. Handling dark and long winters gives us glomy mindset? Watch it at least twice!"
8.0,7 October 2024,"Just watched ""JOKER: FOLIE À DEUX"".

The bad reviews online scared me but it actually became the reason why I enjoyed the film twice better.

I also love the way they chose music for this movie. All the songs perfectly describe the story and Gaga's vocals nailed them.

Her performance in this movie proves that she's a professional actress. Without her, trust me, none of these would be possible.

And don't even get me started on Joaquin Phoenix, y'all already know who he is.

The finale of this movie is something I'll need so much time to process. I was just so surprised by the end.

This movie is so deep with such a deep meaning behind it. Definitely a must-watch."
8.0,15 October 2024,"All Arthur wanted to do was hear the song, but he was dragged away before he could find his light.

This is not a movie for the masses, not a spectacle for the sheep. This is cinema for those who love art and life.

The madness of two, is not only the inclusion of another chaotic persona, but the repercussions of this second film. This is not a sequel. This is not a musical. It is a coda for a beautiful character whose only means of self expression were defiled by those who naively felt a need to bask in the spectacle of his shadow.

A harsh commentary on sensationalism, the purpose of art, and the means in which all things without a voice are culled by misunderstanding and ignorance.

A billion dollars made this, YOU wanted this. But sadly YOU don't know what to do with it. Stop biting the hand that feeds you, you'll starve."
8.0,7 October 2024,"We saw this today at Odeon luxe.

I don't go by reviews as opinion is subjective. This was a superb film. The character development and storytelling were sublime.

I loved how these two mentally disordered people expressed themselves through music and singing. It all fitted together like a jigsaw.

The acting from Joakim from phenomenal and Gaga was brilliant too. Joakim will surely get an Oscar for this.

I'm a mental health nurse of 27 years so perhaps I could relate to the characters better than someone who doesn't have this experience but I found it incredibly sad and the scene where the Joker was laid naked on his front by the Guards was particularly harrowing bearing in mind the Joker's previous abuse.

The ending was also desperately sad but I'm sure the story will not end there.

I would go so far as to say that the whole production is a work of genius and it was well worth our time and money."
8.0,5 October 2024,"Got the luxury to go see this with my wife. Have to admit that I was initially a bit offset by all the negative press, but that rinsed off already in the starting minutes of the flick.

There are multiple stories factored in. The focus on the psychological conflict inside Arthur is still heavily in there (like in the first part) and the emotional and at times raunchy musical bits are a pure joy to follow. I really applaud that the music actually allows to dig deeper into the character mindsets, and by doing so it gives way more dimension and depth than pure storytelling could ever do. Bravo.

On top of the above, the dark romance between Joker and Harley is vividly brought to life. Better than ever before. Regardless of what comes after the movie events, this was truly powerfully done.

After seeing the movie and digesting it all, you can re-piece the experience anew to get it all to yet another level by connecting it all to the Batman universe. Simply wow. Candy for the brain.

Hats off to the producing crew, Joaquin and Lady Gaga. Thank you for making this happen. Pure genious!"
10.0,12 October 2024,"Funny funny, what to expect from a joker but to give a great not so expected joke... People anticipating on another glorification of violence sequel, are served with a romantic musical. With great performances of joaquin and gaga. And the storyline goes on from joker 1 with lots of familiar faces and incidents and directed in a interestingly smart way. Love this movie, thank you for daring to put something less expected in the universe of super heroes and so. This one is sure one to watch if you're truly interested in the heart and soul of joker instead of another all guns out blazing movie forgotten when leaving the cinema."
10.0,9 October 2024,"The psychological elements and themes were thoughtfully crafted in this fever dream. While the awkward star power casts away the shadowy charm of the original Joker it would be untrue to consider this a bad sequel. Instead, it poignantly reflects the narratives we construct in our own minds.

Joker 2 clears the poker table with an all-in bet, confronting cycles of trauma and fear head-on. The sequel serves as a necessary wrap-up to the important messages introduced in the first film, which profoundly shook our zeitgeist. In a world where we continuously witness the effects of fear, judgment, and victimhood, this film underscores the idea that these narratives can become mere bad stories we tell ourselves to escape the harshness of reality. Joker after Joker this film couldn't have come out at a more important time. Fear, judgement, victimhood, it's just a bad story people read to themselves so that we can fall asleep to life.

In conclusion, Joker 2 arrives at a pivotal moment, reinforcing its predecessor's impact while exploring the complexities of human experience.

*sigh* But yeah, some suburban nerd said, ""Lets make a musical."""
9.0,7 October 2024,"I absolutely loved it!

When I came out of the cinema after the first movie - I was dancing on the street like he did in the bathroom scene! I was absolutely mesmerized by him as a character and to this day Joker is one of my favourite movie.

After seeing this one I burst out into tears and not because it was that bad , it's because it was that sad and I was moved.

Absolutely heartbreaking story of a troubled man who's been abused and traumatised as a child...never really understood love and never really had a personality to develop...his escape is being the Joker! The Joker who doesn't care about consequences and only wants chaos!

In this movie the musical element is key. That is his only way of communication for love which he finally feels...the only hope he can escape to in his miserable life.

I feel that what the director did with the characters was very bold and thought provoking! It did surprise me and I'm a big ""comic book Joker and Harley fan"". I loved this movie for multiple reasons! It's a different take on the characters...but this is not about the Joker... it's about Arthur and I think that's the key! Another masterpiece!"
9.0,6 October 2024,"Hot take: Joker: Folie à Deux is one of the greatest Comic Book Movie of all time, like genuinely, I don't think I've seen anything better and the only two movies that can compare is either Morbius or Madame Web. The people who say this movie is bad don't understand cinema or are pseudo intellectuals. If you can, I highly recommend you to watch this movie and let me know how it is - I would genuinely do anything to watch this movie for the first time again.

Continuing on, Joaquin Phoenix's and Lady Gaga's acting is mesmerizing, truly phenomenal and recordbreaking, I didn't have high hopes for this movie when I heard it was gonna be a musical but goddamn this movie is breathtaking.

The visuals and CGI is S tier like every DC movie, you can tell the directors and VFX team put a lot of heart and effort into making this movie and rating it any lower than a 9/10 is a disgrace to actual cinema fans who know masterpieces when they watch one.

Todd Phillips' original Joker 2019 wasn't that great, it was a D tier movie with overhyped acting and writing, but Joker: Folie à Deux fixes all of that with amazing writing, phenomenal acting, great visuals and cgi, and last but not least, an absurdly good sidecast and team.

Dexays overall review: 9.8/10

Sincerely, Dexays."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I loved everything about this movie. Every song had a meaning pertaining to him. It was soulful and beautiful. A look inside his tortured life. The music was spectacular The acting was astounding. 10/10. I think I will download the soundtrack. Gaga was so amazing and beautiful.

I am a bit older so the song choices were so wonderful to listen to.

I really enjoyed the court room antics.

I am so confused about the ratings not being high.

I do recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys something different. A breath of fresh air.

All in all I'm very happy I chose to goa nd see this movie Defiantly recommend."

9.0,9 October 2024,"Humanity is unpredictable. We desperately want to be allies of what's right while hiding our opinions when we favor that which is deemed wrong. Joker: Folie a Deux is being ridiculed by many people for a multitude of reasons. It's the first comic book movie to earn a D CinemaScore, it has a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, 5.3/10 on IMDb, and 45% on Metacritic.

So, why did I enjoy this movie when seemingly no one else did?

Todd Phillips writes a beautifully complex story detailing the unbearable challenges of seeking acceptance and validation in a world of characters who are trying to do the same. What's the number one human desire? To feel important. Joaquin Phoenix shows us two descriptive versions of this character: one who puts on a face and showcases a fluffed confidence because of the validation/attention he receives (shadow version of Arthur Fleck), and one who's broken, lonely, and timid with vulnerability (real version of Arthur Fleck). This isn't a version of the Joker we've seen before, nor is Phillips trying to get to that point. Rather than focusing on the result of the Joker character as seen in performances from Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Hamill, audiences are given layers of insight into how this particular character (or others around him) could eventually end up in a place of complete madness while maintaining a sense of honest identity. Hildur Guðnadóttir elevates the personality of this story with her deeply penetrative score alongside a masterful and practical visual compilation from Lawrence Sher. The musical element works because of its imperfection, but the more grand each production becomes, the farther away those moments feel from what the story is trying to say. This is a human story living within a superhero world, and though the flare of creating crimes or saving people from them feels absent, the inspiration for creating a villain has never felt more authentic (hence the concluding scene)."

9.0,5 October 2024,"I loved every minute of the movie. A very powerful and moving story. It is very important to notice that people of Gotham don't really care about mental illness, they are only interested in the cult of JOKER, they only want to see and hear JOKER and so does the audience. At the moment when the film becomes more about Arthur than Joker, the audience makes a judgment that the film is bad. We have to understand that JOKER movie is not about being silly and frivolous and people go to the cinema expecting that. If you plan to see this movie, pay special attention to the cartoon that is shown at the beginning, it is very important for the plot.

I really loved the movie and think it was brilliant.

I will rewatch it next week!

Also, don't really understand the hatred for musicals."
8.0,11 October 2024,"I read the reviews on here, mostly bad, just before I went to the cinema and thought, oh well, if it's that bad it's just a movie.

I sat there expecting not to like it, but found myself drawn in, I started to understand why using music/signing was so important, it added an extra depth into the mind.

I think those who focussed on it being partly a musical didn't really understand the first movie. I think we have a long way to go before mental health is understood and looked upon by society.

Loved the filming, acting, not sure lady gaga was the best choice, but she wasn't that bad a choice either. Definitely something worth watching in the cinema."
9.0,16 October 2024,"Yes this is mainly a musical movie and a great one, the dramatic plot being a pretext but well conceived and acted. Joaquin Phoenix (the Joker) is a great actor and performs an excellent part in a complicated one. The plot is about his double personality as Arthur Fleck. In custody at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the crimes he committed before and as the Joker, a great comedian who has lots of fans who even want that he becomes free. We will then follow his trial where he dismisses his lady lawyer and also simultaneously his love affair with Harleen ""Lee"" another patient at the Hospital. This has several dramatic events including a severe bomb explsion thet destroys thr court room and kills and injuries several people. This is an excellent movie including visual tchnique and acting perfrormance."
9.0,5 October 2024,"I actually enjoyed it. This was not your typical DC movie, however I do think people that are not open minded and in the world of fine arts will understanding the depth of what the director was trying to do. As an artist the psychological part in producing something different away from its norm IS always a challenge. Joker 2 did continue its story from part one and how he became vulnerable when he meets someone. I absolutely loved how all aspects of the fine arts was add to this movie. Not many will understand and that's ok, but this movie was not horrible as everyone is claiming it to be. Open your mind to something different. Story tell becomes dull at one point when it is repetitive."
8.0,6 October 2024,"I do not understand the overwhelming hate this movie has received, much of it seeming like bandwagon criticism. While I get that some viewers had different expectations, this film should not be crucified for taking a unique approach.

The standout aspect is the stunning cinematography. Every scene feels carefully constructed, from the shot composition to the transitions and camera angles - it is truly a visual masterpiece! Joaquin Phoenix, as expected, delivers a phenomenal performance, embodying the role perfectly. Lady Gaga, despite initial skepticism, turned out to be a refreshing surprise, bringing an unexpectedly fitting vibe to her character.

The narrative takes an unconventional route, pulling us into the Joker's chaotic mind and blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality. This creates a dynamic, bold storytelling approach that contrasts euphoria with misery in a way that feels unique to the film.

That said, the musical elements, though fitting at times, occasionally felt excessive. Additionally, Harley Quinn's role left too many unresolved questions, coming across as unfinished. The portrayal of the attorney also puzzled me, as the character felt unnecessarily irritating and unlikable.

One of the film's strengths lies in how it humanizes the Joker, exploring his psychological vulnerabilities and blending them with reflections on mental health and identity. This gives the movie an additional layer of complexity.

In summary, this is a bold sequel that caught many by surprise. Despite the backlash, it is a high-quality film with exceptional cinematography and performances. For those who appreciate the art of cinema, I highly recommend it."
9.0,16 October 2024,
9.0,11 October 2024,"With all the negativity around it, I almost feel obliged to apologise for ....yes: loving it.

There are a few reasons why that is:

First of all: if Joker was a reminiscence to Taxi Driver, this one is highly inspired by ""Dancer in the Dark"". There are, in my opinion many similarities! So I get where Todd is coming from, when and why the musical scenes happen.

I love slow transition of Lee to Harley Quinn. The easy to miss first patterns on her stockings to her last outfit.

The Gary Puddle scene is incredible.

And the ending is the perfect transition ... it I keep it vague to not spoil it.

The acting is still great from Joaquin Phoenix & Lady Gaga.

The cinematography is superb.

Last but not least: I can highly relate to his mental state and think it's depicted authentic and believable.

Maybe in the future, people will look back at this movie just like on ""The Crow"" from 1994. Critics and viewers didn't like it back then, but it's fanbase grew over time to a cult classic.

You can disagree and I get where people are coming from.

But I dare to say: I love it.

And I am not sorry to say so."
8.0,9 October 2024,"Superb film with a great performance by Lady Gaga and nothing short of an Oscar winning performance by Joaquin Phoenix in a film which is probably not a superhero fan favorite, but which is brave and constantly surprises. The inclusion of songs works to perfection and is used intelligently and seamlessly throughout the film, and adds to its boldness. The film also works as a critique of the current toxic political climate, where lies and deception have become openly valid and accepted strategies. My biggest surprise concerning this brilliant film, though, has been how few people get it and must have left the cinema feeling let down by its intentional omission of any Batman or other superhero references."

If you want a captivating, emotionally mature film (and wish I could say more but I hate spoilers) then go watch it!

I see so many people give it a 1 star rating because they thought they were going to watch the next Batman, I guess. To me this film perfectly explores the themes in the first movie and develops the main character. The portrayal of Harlequin fits well into the set universe."
8.0,12 October 2024,"Just came out of the theater, and I get why fans of the traditional Batman Universe Joker might not warm up to this version.

However, if you're open to a fresh take on the character, one that explores the dark, passionate, and redemptive aspects of the Joker-set to the backdrop of soulful blues-you're in for something special.

Joaquin Phoenix is nothing short of brilliant in his portrayal. You don't just watch him; you feel him embody the Joker's complex, tortured persona in a way that's deeply immersive.

That said, I estimate that maybe 10% of viewers will truly connect with and be captivated by ""Joker: Folie à Deux"".

For me, though, this film is both tragically beautiful and undeniably brilliant."
9.0,10 October 2024,"I think a lot of people badly misunderstand this movie. They expected a movie that was exactly the same as the first movie, but the protagonist is in a VASTLY different world.

This is the story of fantasy blending with reality. The conflict of the world at large disagreeing with a man's internal one. At the same time, a world begging for his fantasy to be reality to use him as a device of retribution. With a world hungry for the kind of justice he could create if only he would give in and embrace the dark world of his fantasy, of rage, of destruction.

The nature of this movie is indulgence. Indulging a mad man's vast incompetency. Of misguided people suffering in a dark world NEEDING his fantasy to come true. A world craving the destruction, hatred and death that would unleash.

Of his world being supported in fantasy and his experiencing of something that would have required him to stop being part of who he really was. For him to shun his humanity and embrace something darker.

This is not a fun movie. It is not one which is easy to watch or super enjoyable, the musical numbers are hollow and discordant, the expressions of love are false, misleading. The entire plot is the unraveling of something that never existed, a fantasy, living that fantasy and upon realizing its loss, losing everything except himself.

I can see why people hated the movie. I understand it. But this movie is in MANY ways an artistic masterpiece. Something so raw and unburdened by delivering something as expected that it does something really brave, terrible and difficult to watch."

10.0,13 October 2024,"I have watched this at the cinema on release date, I found the film depressing but the music added some light which it needed.

The film left me feeling exhausted as the plot of the film went in all directions, it was disjointed at times.

Overall it was a good film. I have seen the first film and I'm glad this film wasn't as dark.

I am a fan of lady gaga and her music but not her films.

I feel her range of acting skills isn't there, the characters she plays in most films seem like the same person.

I feel she is playing lady gaga in every film and I find it tiresome.

Gaga the musician is great but gaga the actor is not."
8.0,10 October 2024,"I'm a jaded movie buff who's watched too many movies. These days it's a challenge to find something engaging. The first Joker left me luke warm, but I loved this one. I feel like watched a different movie to the reviewers who called it boring. But I don't like superhero movies. They truly are boring and not what I understand as real cinema.

Folie à Deux is to me study in pain, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. This is not a musical in the traditional sense. More a mockery of a Hollywood musical, as you expect from the Joker, no? Each song as performed by Phoenix is a howl of pain. This movie is dark and twisted, like the Joker is supposed.

Or do you prefer the pantomime Joker by Nicholson?

The Jocker mocks musicals, and courtroom dramas, and prison movie tropes, he mocks lawyers, and judges, and the Joker mocks his own fan boys that try to own him by ""freeing"" from the courtroom. That's exactly what we should expect the Joker to do, isn't it? Or did you think you were immune from his mockery? He's calling you a schmuck. Yes, you. That's what the Joker does - nobody is spared, right? In his eyes, we are all the joke."
10.0,15 October 2024,"In 2019, i watched Joker with a couple friends at the theater, had no idea what the general reception of the film was, didn't even know it was rated r, we just felt like going to the movies. While my friends and i kinda looked at each other during the movie it became obvious that they were more like, ""wtf is this i thought this was gonna be a superhero movie"" and i was like ""is this allowed? I didn't know it was ok to release movies like this, but i love it."" and now in 2024 i go to the theater and once again, this was NOT what i expected.

Unlike last time, i knew the general reception going into this, people are clearly not into it. But uknow what, i haven't been to the theater in a bit, might as well see what all the talk is about. And yea i see why so many people couldn't get on board with this, but turns out i was 100% the target audience.

If you wanna see the psychological deconstruction of a clown with a killing streak told through musical numbers and a thick cloud of cigarette smoke, than this is the movie for you. Bonus points for good songs, impentitent social commentary, and a three minute 2D animated segment. It's still not perfect but it was definitely better than i thought it would be, even before i saw all the negative reviews."
10.0,8 October 2024,"So I went in expecting it to be as bad as everyone seems to be claiming it to be, and left impressed.

Yes it's a musical and yes it's probably not what we expected it to be. But that doesn't mean it's not brilliant.

If you go into this wanting it all to be about joker and a backstory etc then your going to leave disappointed. It's Arthur's story, about how his mind has been shaped by his trauma. The musical elements fit perfectly in my opinion and I love how it reflects Arthur's fantasy.

I feel like the people leaving negative reviews must be marvel fans lol, and to those saying there was no story? The idea of joker is him having no back story! And this film isn't really about joker it's about Arthur!

Great film."

If youve grown up with actions figures, if you love the DC world, if you love the idea of Batman and joker in the real world and if you know "" I'm just one bad day away from you""

Go watch it!

The movie is amazing and has an Easter egg too, if you're not blind that is, which seems to be the case with the world giving bad reviews.

I generally don't write reviews because apparently you gotta add 500 characters Only putting up the efforts because reviews made me question the decision of going to an Imax to watch the movie, but just walked out of the theatre and putting a review is the first thing I'm doing so that people who actually like movies and the DC world don't get dissuaded."

Saw it as a part 2 extension & insight into The Jokers personality PBA/PD disorder.

Complex, confusing, changing, chameleon, unconventional & off-centre.

Appreciate for many the film will disappoint. But for us psychologists & therapists its looking at the film from many different angles.

Whilst i often immerse into films & just flow & watch, for this its different. Its analysis, pattern hunting & seeing how to cope with narcissistic, childhood trauma.

It did drag in parts but life is not consistent box ticking. Ga Ga & Phoenix were great.

Loved it!"
10.0,3 October 2024,"The film is profoundly deep in analyzing human nature and character.

It shows the whole spectrum of human emotions and different emotional needs.

It is enough to follow the main character, his emotions and the relationships he has with all the characters in the film, as well as the emotions of the masses who put his dysfunctionality on the throne, which he wants to renounce, but without it he is nothing again in the eyes of his crazy followers.

This is a psychological thriller where the action only serves to accompany the emotional twists. Starring Joaquin Phoenix deserves another Oscar. The film shows society and tendencies in detail, and that's the only thing we can dislike about this film, because it shows them as they are in all their ugliness."
10.0,15 October 2024,"Joker 1 was the destruction of Arthur for the birth of the Joker, as his soul played a voiceless instrumental within his mind for he has no one, no one to voice himself to.

The sequel starts with Arthur reclaimed as a beaten man with consequences from a shadow that has taken his face to commit chaos. Arthur accepting of his consequences, until he finds hope through love. Love that he will never realize is a toxicity that fuels this shadow that Arthur himself would much rather be without, for the shadow has Arthur's dreams but will take it in the ways that will burn all around them.

Joy & Gloom."
8.0,15 October 2024,"Despite hearing all of the overly critical reviews, I branched out and watched it anyway, with low expectations. As a fan of the first movie, this was not at all that, though still a wonderful viewing experience. If you were expecting something similar to the first movie, you'll be surprised by the different, more toned down and romantic vibes of the sequel. The violent aspect is done tastefully and the effects are decent, though some of the blood physics are slightly off. Overall, I found the pacing to be actually quite lovely and the music to be a beautiful addition to an already beautiful movie. Not to mention the excellent cinematography. Cast and crew did an amazing job on this one. 8/10 ""No, Gaga!"" -quote while watching film."
8.0,3 October 2024,"Lady gaga pleases audiences with her standout acting for this role as Lee! This movie is cohesive to the first one, but at the same time is refreshing and new. This new embodiment of Harley is real and raw to the point her craziness surpasses that of Arthur. Musical sequences may not be for everybody, but they are placed at points in the movie that truly help understand how Joker and Lee see the world through their perspective. Story itself does take a slow pace to fully take off, but when it does, you do get to experience the pain, sadness, happiness, and drama that is unveiled all within 2hrs of this movie. Surprise twists that were unexpected within this movie and it's worth a watch if you loved the first one!"
10.0,8 October 2024,"Should a Director just go for what the audience is expecting? Or should a Director be creative, challenge and daring the audience?

I would go for the second one - although some might know - Cinema is an Art. Not mass production.

Joker Folie à Deux it's not a sequel, nor a Spin-off. It's a Masterpiece.

What were haters and critics waiting after Joker? This movie is not Joker II - is Joker Folie à Deux.

No doubt one of the best movies (ART) I've seen this year - I rated it 10/10.

Sorry haters & critics that just wanted a Joker II - I understand the disappointing - but thank you, Todd Phillips for the Folie à Deux, the best movie I've seen this year.

I loved Joker, and I loved Folie à Deux."

10.0,5 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux dials up the tragedy to the max with a sequel that takes the kind of huge risks you're only allowed to do after you've made a billion dollars. It's the rare comic book film to actually commit to the genres it's hybridising as it's pretty much a 50/50 split between the musical and courtroom drama aspects. There's not a single comic book film like it, including its own predecessor, and there never will be.

Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as he avoids a retread of familiar ground by creating a larger divide between Arthur and Joker. Arthur remains so pitiful with his softly spoken voice and defeated nature whereas he's almost too confident once the makeup is on. However, there's a much greater turmoil here as Joker becomes more a performance to gain popularity than something he actually believes in, which visibly weighs on him.

Lady Gaga is great as a very unique version of Harley Quinn who's obsession with Joker is highly convincing. The romance that blooms between them is surprisingly sweet though not without it's darker elements and she's obviously got a phenomenal singing voice when it's needed. Even with a very small role Harry Lawtey brings the required self assured smarmy nature that defines this version of Harvey Dent.

Its generally too long but Todd Philips' direction makes up for it by being a lot more unique from the very start where it opens with a Looney Tunes style cartoon that basically sums up the central argument of the film. There's a great use of the IMAX aspect ratio to signal an incoming musical sequence and Lawrence Sher's cinematography is superb yet again thanks some astonishingly good long takes in particular.

The musical numbers are a more natural fit than they seem since music was already a vital part of the original. Some of them could've gone on for longer however they all nail the old Hollywood feel, allowing Arthur to escape into fantasy and they're sung in such an emotionally raw fashion. Because of those musical elements, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score takes a back seat for the most part whilst still being a beautifully bleak highlight."

It is consoling to see that there are people still genuinely passionate and ambitious about movie making, and there is still space for them in Hollywood.

This is what cinema should be, a piece of entertainment and an attempt of expression rather than just a series of bulk produced manufactured scenes of actions. It asks the audience to have an open mind, and to think and feel not knowing if it's their thing or not, which increasingly becomes an impossible request to fulfil."

It's better than the first.

It establishes Arthur is no less powerful than Joker. The daringly original and brave movie is not about entertainment but as artistic as a great poetry or a painting. It challenges viewer's expectation and prediction almost all the time and in turn it presents something that's undeniably far more shocking, cruel and realistic . One can relate or identify to ""I can't breathe"" and other Police cruelty and the failure of the justice system. Beautifully crafted challenging your expectations every minute and instead giving something far more amazing."
9.0,13 October 2024,"If you didn't enjoy the Joker movie because of the musical aspect, grow up 😂 The new Joker movie was an unconventional and well made sequel that builds upon the first film's themes with a bold musical twists. It avoids the typical superhero movie formula by focusing deeply on Arthur Fleck through a psychological thriller. The decision to include musical sequences, where the music itself reflects Arthur's mental instability and relationship with Lee, adds a unique layer to the story. These moments give insight into his psyche, amplifying the narrative with songs compare reality and delusion, effectively mirroring his fractured state of mind. This musical element not only complements the Joker's identity as a performer (literally a singing clown) but also emphasises the emotional intensity of his journey.

Although some negative reviews focus on the film's departure from traditional superhero movie expectations in DC and Marvel, the unique approach of the movie allows for a more profound exploration of the characters challenges, soul, and transformation. Joaquin and Lady Gaga were perfect for those roles and truly brought the magic to life!

Overall, the movie's use of music and the psychological interplay between characters set it apart, making it an amazing watch for those open to a deeper, more soulful interpretation of the iconic character!"

8.0,13 October 2024,"I don't why this film is getting so much hate! I think people going into it expecting a continuation of the first film or another Batman-esque Gotham villain film or some Marvel type film will be very disappointed. If you go into this abandoning all that and expecting a highly stylized, visionary look into the mental state of Arthur Fleck and mental illness and dealing with a disturbed world explored through amazing dance and musical numbers with the fabulous Lady Gaga as his counterpart- you'll love it. It's not the usual Joker film but I'm glad. I hate when sequels regurgitate their successful predecessor, copying all the parts that made it a box office hit; I don't usually agree with the term ""brave"" for cinema or music because I think brilliance is brilliance, not brave but Folie a Deux is brave and daring and Phillips takes Gotham to a new level. It is truly original in its use of music and dance whilst exploring Arthur Fleck's story and disturbed nature. I've never seen mental problems and state of mind so connected with music and song in a film. From the first number up until the last- you can tell exactly how his character is feeling just by type of song or dance and very subtle expressions or movement. And it's not cringe at all!

Him and Gaga have great chemistry and as always his acting is superb. He carries real empathy and heart within the character, as well as depravity. Gaga fits into his world perfect and her voice is dazzlingly. They're both great. I want more. Donald Gleeson as the prison guard was great too, he's always good.

Give it a few years when people have gotten over the shock of singing in a Joker film and it'll be a cult film. I've been listening to the Gaga album on repeat since. I hope it gains the credibility it deserves. Truly art. A real win for everyone involved. I hope they're not discouraged from the reviews. And please go see it."
10.0,11 October 2024,"One side complains how superhero movies have lost solid character pieces for the sake of CGI fight scenes.

Another side has trouble handling movies such as this one.

I wish there didn't have to be such a wide alienation from clever writing. I wish we could have more pieces like this, which are at least trying to convey something thought provoking.

Because truthfully, we love superhero stories when the characters are the most interesting thing. We love to see Batman be Bruce Wayne. We love to know how Joker got to be the way he did, as much as the hero.

This movie deserves more love than it is receiving. Thank you for trying to give us smart films, at least smarter than bizarre CGI alien zones, with CGI action figure battles, sandwiched between mind numbing exposition.

Thank you for trying. If you stay consistent, and keep giving it your all, return it to a thoughtful art piece, then perhaps the superhero genre will be something worth saving.

I really hope this is the mark of some clever story telling. Comics have always been art first, and appealing to children second.

Return to the art, and let the mature kids grow with time."

The joker is a victim of abuse and society wants to keep him boxed as joker and a villain to give themselves validity. When joker decides to be Arthur Fleck, and become in touch with reality, they turned against him.

It's very deep and elucidates and unpacks the imaginary world of dissociation and mental escape.

I came out of the theatre almost in tears. I was amazed how good this movie was. I don't understand the negative reviews.

He was never destined to become the Joker, and that's exactly what makes his story so powerful. It's a raw, emotional journey that leaves the audience reflecting on the thin line between despair and madness.

This sequel serves as a bold, daring closing chapter, one that transcends comic book origins and tells a story of humanity lost, and ultimately, of a man who never truly became a villain.

Each scene was a gift the audience, revealing the depths of Arthur's struggle and showcasing the beauty and pain of his descent. These artistic choices elevate the narrative, making it not just a sequel but a profound exploration of a troubled soul, leaving viewers with a lasting impression that lingers long after. I'm sure everyone will learn to love it with time, as it happen with the first movie. Thank you for this remarkable sequel and powerful end to his story!!!"

I don't understand why people are hating on it. I can only assume they either didn't understand the first film or they don't understand mental illness.

As someone who sings (yes, outloud) and dances when I'm out on my walks. As someone who has always felt an outsider. As someone who seeks comfort and safety in a fantasy world. As someone who has spent time in a psychiatric institution. As someone who has had suicidal tendencies. As someone who has a mental illness which some people try to play down (""well, aren't we all a little autistic?"". No, Karen. We're not.) - and yes, that scene in the courtroom where his mental illness is being discounted hurt a lot and made me very angry). As someone who seeks justice and fairplay. And as someone who just tries to do good in a world which is bad, this film hit me hard and I found it incredibly emotional. Chapeau, Todd Phillips. Your film is art. I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
10.0,4 October 2024,"The movie has a shocking impact that makes you contemplate. The scenes are disjointed and that is the bolstering effect to the shocking impact. By being disjointed and chaotic, the movie forces you to profoundly pierce each scenes and comprehensively knit the scenes together. The sound effects and transition between music and speaking is so smooth and balanced that keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time to figure out the meaning of each scene. The occasional music jumping in brings out some deeper thinking about the themes of the scenes with the music in it. Clearly disjointing the scenes also helps you focus on each scene more without mixing the scenes up making it too much for your mind to handle. For instance, the scenes being disjointed have expressed more deeply the dynamic behavior and relationship between the characters, including between Joker and Harley. The character development and change are more clearly seen by disjointing the scenes.

The movie is chaotic, and being narratively cohesive will counter the shocking effect of the movie. Being cohesive will make the narration feel forced and make you not diving into each scene deeper. In the end, you are shocked about the chaos the movie brings and will think deeply about everything you just watched. After the ending, the movie will produce lasting thoughts on you."
8.0,7 October 2024,"People must understand the fact that a sociopath and psychopath personalities. You can't compare the dark knight's joker with this. Joaquin Phoenix perfectly shows a sick crime mastermind brain's inside. With its cinematography, cast and the musics this film deserves to be on the one of the top list. Therefore, all of these facts resembles to a point that this film is revoloutianary for all cinema and superhero films history. To feel the music and the sfx better you should watch this on cinema. The development of the character joker is nearly perfect. I believe that everyone can find a piece of his/herself in this film."

8.0,10 October 2024,"""Joker 2"" stands out as a masterpiece of 2024 cinema, combining exceptional performances and stunning cinematography that elevate the narrative to new heights. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is, once again, breathtaking, bringing an emotional depth that captures the complexity of the character. He transforms not only physically, but also psychologically, conveying the Joker's anguish and vulnerability in a visceral way. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga, whose equally impressive performance enriches the narrative, brings a new dimension to the plot. Together, they create a fascinating dynamic, exploring themes of love and insanity that leave the audience reflecting on the nature of the human being. Furthermore, the cinematography in the film is a work of art in itself. The lighting choices and visual composition create a unique atmosphere that intensifies each scene. The dark, contrasting color palette reflects the characters' mental state, while innovative camera angles contribute to the audience's immersion in the story. The aesthetics not only complement the narrative but elevate it, making it a memorable visual experience. These elements, combined with visionary direction and an impactful soundtrack, solidify ""Joker: Delirium for Two"" as one of the best films of the year. It is a work that not only entertains, but also provokes deep reflection on the human condition. Given this, his nomination for several Oscars is more than deserved; is a celebration of a film that rewrites the rules of the genre and leaves an indelible mark on the history of cinema."
10.0,8 October 2024,"This movie knows what it is. This movie knows how to get its audience where it wants them. How the masses can grip onto the first movie and act like there's some great disconnect between the two is beyond me. This sequel is a perfect counterpart to its original, being opposite in certain ways and paralleled in others. It's bold, it's real, it's surprising. Also, this is the best live Harley Quinn we've had, so for what that's worth.

The music doesn't jar, it fits where it's put, and it's well done. The singing doesn't distract or feel squished, and it doesn't take away from the performances. It's a slower burn, for sure, but it's less indulgent and more painful than the first movie."
10.0,5 October 2024,"Arthur knows how to make his impressions and how unique the film really is. From what I have heard from others which came from Google review audiences was a bad idea and atrocious. From after seeing it today, Joker: Folie à Deux is a phenominal masterpiece. The performances, especially from Joaquin Phoenix, are nothing short of spectacular-once again proving his incredible talent. The writing is sharp, the production is top-notch, and it all comes together as a powerful piece of art. For those who criticize this film for not adhering strictly to the original comics, it's time to expand your perspective. This is more than a comic book adaptation; it's an exploration of emotions, psyche, and the human condition. It's not just about violence or mental illness-it's about making us feel deeply. This movie transcends the typical boundaries of superhero storytelling and offers something raw and real. Lady Gaga is truly still the musician as she represents. The musical number from a DC R-Rated film was definitely amazing idea. The opening scene when opens up like those early 20th century cartoons that theme definitely brings back childhood memories. I myself use to watch these cartoons but that theme in the opening was something I adore. This maybe one of my top tier films of this year along side with FURIOSA, GRAVE TORTURE, WINNIE THE POOH BLOOD AND HONEY 2, OUT OF DARKNESS, ARCADIAN and THE PEASANTS. Remarkable film and definitely be purchasing it on VOD when it comes out."

10.0,9 October 2024,"Despite the negative reviews, I really liked the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance, as always, is on top, and Lady Gaga pleased me with her version of Harley Quinn. The technical performance of the movie is to my credit. The musical numbers fully demonstrate the inner world of Arthur Fleck. Many viewers will find the movie long and boring, as the main events take place in two locations. But if you don't take into account the sluggish pacing, the movie doesn't deserve such negative reviews. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would love to see a third part, although it probably won't happen, but it would be interesting to see a Batman from this universe."
10.0,9 October 2024,
10.0,9 October 2024,"First of all I will begin with the fact that most people hate that movie just because it turned out to be a musical. When the first joker movie was released they said that the next one they will make will be a musical so you shouldn't complain about that. Second of all a lot of people are upset of the fact that joker revealed that there is no real joker, if you watched the movie carefuly you could see that joker had his ''breaking point'' somewhere which I am not planning to spoil for those that haven't quite understood yet.

In my perspective i believe the movie was set up nicely and all of the scenes were full of meaning. To sum up, the movie was a great choice, obviously you CANNOT compare it to the first joker movie but I totally recommend it."

10.0,16 October 2024,"I never take time to write a review but this time I have to. It's singlehandedly on of the best movies I've seen in, well, forever. I was so excited and blown away that I would've bought tickets for another viewing right after I left the cinema.

For the people who are doubting to see this one, if you like multi-layered dark, psychological, sad, heartfelt, funny, emotionally engaging movies, GO AND SEE IT! I'm actually curious about this director's other films now, but these two Joker movies have to be his best performances ever.

I'm having a hard time remembering when I last had this reaction to a movie and that would have to be Django Unchained or Inglourious Basterds. I loved Taxi Driver, but I score Joker 2 way above it, like miles above.

The musical elements were absolutely not tiring or tedious but very fitting and blew me awaymultiple times. I was in awe of Joaquin's performance and although I was hesitant about the casting of Gaga, she complemented him to the T. The critics who stated that Todd didn't take advantage of the acting talent of Gaga didn't see what I saw obviously, because I was super impressed and she moved me many times.

Soooo much better than I could have expected and I will remember this one for EVER."
8.0,9 October 2024,
9.0,16 October 2024,"Even if you think the insanity of a musical is fully appreciated in a movie about the criminally insane, is one of the bad jokes, this picture is one of the good ones nevertheless. The flickering balloon of the Joker is allowed to bursts on prime time, in a world that is as caring as a ruthless gothic society can be. The music, the psychological roots, even the camera angles pay tribute to the clown's golden age.

And although he lets everybody down in the end, not more than the social conditions which bring him doom. This seems to be the narrators' way of showing how much they care, their tribute. It is an act true to the psychological architype he represents. It also is an honest assessment of the Joker as an allegory for the chaotic forces bordering to a crazy carnival of change. It kills that false promise. The Joker as a successful political leader; or insane criminals as a force of coherent change, would have amounted to a true betrayal.

This is a movie which can only be underrated in societies which prefer cheesy dick jokes over Bill Hicks. 8/10 (minus 1 because I hate musicals)."

10.0,9 October 2024,"This movie was fun to watch, I enjoy it. I went in knowing it was going to be dark and gritty. Also Enjoy that it was somewhat a musical. I feel Joaquin Phoenix and lady Gaga did a good job. I also feel this is a movie you have to be open minded to see. If you know the joker and Harley quin character from the batman show and d.c batman comics , and other batman movies, then don't expect this to be those exact characters. This is a standalone sequel to the Joker movie and it's did bring alot of Joy, laughter, psychological fear, and alot of thrill. Please don't miss out on watching this movie just cause there's a expectation of what this movie should and shouldn't be."
10.0,5 October 2024,
8.0,6 October 2024,"This movie deserves so much respect and admiration. It really touched at my heart strings, I felt every little emotion from Joaquin as if it were my own.

Honestly, you have to know what it is like to be abused, forced to keep on smiling, to understand what his character is always trying to convey.

For me, the movie solely rests on phoenix delivering the performance of a lifetime.

Most people will give an outright bad review to this movie, only because they haven't developed an understanding of their own emotions, or haven't really been faced with challenges of this kind. It deeply moved me, I have been plagued with mental disorders when I was in my 20s and it tugged at me and reminded me of that pain so very much.

I'm thankful that there are still movie directors who want to relay raw emotion instead of just put out a violent, action movie.

I hope that other directors and script writers are not let down because their effort is recognised by some if not many and that's what they should be aiming at, staying true to their vision and not conforming to mass audiences.

It was a great and profound watch for me."
8.0,17 October 2024,"Let's be honest. Most of you aren't pissed about the fact that this is a musical. You're pissed because the director showed your fanboy villain to be a figment of the very imaginations he was meant to inspire.

Todd clearly hated the fact that a bunch of incels thought Joker was their Talisman. So instead of running away - he made a sequel to screw em. Fair play I say.

In creating this follow up the director has made a genius move. He's both stayed true to the first film - but shine a new light on the hero worship given and shown the incel fanboys that being a loner, cynic and hating the world isn't power. It's desperation. Open your windows and minds. There's a world of human love out there."
10.0,7 October 2024,"The moment I heard about the casting and the musical stuff, this is exactly what I had in mind. Was it preferable? No. Did it play good? Yes I guess. But I would've preferred a movie like the first one, more organized and balanced.

This one is still an incredibly amazing installment tho, just not the way I'd pictured after seeing the first one. No need to mention Phoenix' commitment into this. It just blew my mind.

Some scenes were just so obnoxious to see and hard to bear. Some of them were just not easy to conceive all at once. So this one definitely requires multiple watches which I like.

The film is just like the Joker's mind as I describe it. You don't just get it. You don't know what's real or not. You need to put things in places but sometimes you just end up being confused and lost.

As a matter of fact, I loved it. Thank you Phillips."
10.0,17 October 2024,"I really wanted to watch the film. It really bothers me that the world is tearing him apart so much and that well-known critics are also getting involved.

The first part is great and if you look at this second part, everything is actually consistent for me if you take the trouble to look closely. Even the music... I can certainly imagine that it doesn't suit the taste of other action comic admirers. The film is not pure entertainment, it is actually more something to think about.

I had to form my own opinion. And I can only recommend this to everyone.

Finally: The roles are perfectly cast. Great achievements! Thank you for this cinema experience!

A 10 from me!!!!"

9.0,2 October 2024,"I get it, it's an musician, people don't really line the idea of that. But the music has so much stories in it. This movie has a lot och impressions and meanings that people don't understand and respect. So underrated. Also love lady Gaga!! Her vocals are so powerful and her acting is amazing, the acting in the movie was totally amazing and deserves more attention, I don't get the hate. I have seen the news not liking the movie because it was ""meaningless"" but I totally do not agree. I saw this movie with my dad in the cinema and we both walked oit of the cinema and loved it!! I hope it get better later!"
8.0,12 October 2024,"What an incredible follow up to the original Joker! This time you see things from the eyes of the titular character and are a part of the madness instead of just a witness to it! I was concerned Lady Gaga would be too serious to plat Harley Quinn, but boy was I wrong! This is how to make a sequel. Making this a musicial really sets the tone of what it's like in Joker's mind. Not to spoil too much, but it shows how Joker and Harley escape with each other to ignore the real consequences of theirs actions and just revel in what they see as the fun part. My favorite Joker will always be Mark Hamil, but now Phoenix is a very close second."
8.0,5 October 2024,"Joaquin as masterful as in the previous movie, Gaga in her best role yet. Emotional and vulnerable which makes it complex, this movie won't be for everyone which is totally okay. Sometimes it's totally okay to be in the minority about things, especially if it's the right one. ✌🏻 It's totally fine to say that someone doesn't like the direction the second part took, but it's a crime to say that Joaquin and Gaga are bad in it and that it didn't follow the tone of the first part. The movie is called Folie à Deux and that's exactly what we got, and it is quite excessive to call it a musical when it is not in that classical form. The communication of the characters through songs only increased the dynamics and drama of the film and helped us understand their inner worlds a little bit better (which was actually a real enigma to us in the first part of the movie)."
8.0,13 October 2024,"That Joker : Folie A Deux exists at all is a bit of an oddity given 2019 smash hit Joker was always meant to be a stand alone film. That it exists in this form; a song filled courtroom romance that can pretty much be classified as an anti sequel, is nothing short of extraordinary. I'm sure that when star Joaquin Phoenix decided he wanted another go around as troubled loner Arthur Fleck the money men at Warner Bros. Were rubbing their hands but hats off to director Todd Phillips for getting reportedly close to $200 million out of them for this insane vision of a follow up.

Picking up four years after the events of Joker, the Arthur we first see has been beaten down by his years of incarceration. He barely communicates and Brendan Gleeson's guard laments the fact he no longer amuses him and his colleagues with jokes. A glimmer of life returns when an encounter with fellow inmate Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) leads to a blossoming romance. Starved of affection for his entire life, Arthur is instantly besotted while Lee seems far more interested in the antics and mystique of Arthur's Joker persona than the man himself. About a third of the way in, the film switches from prison romance to courtroom drama as Arthur's beleaguered attorney tries to help him avoid the death penalty by proving he has multiple personalities. Her task is made harder as the limelight of the trial and Quinzel's affections fire Arthur up and he becomes more interested in showboating than saving his skin.

Joker may have presented itself as unconventional but Folie A Deux makes that film look like a four quadrant summer tentpole blockbuster by comparison. The first film wore its Martin Scorsese influence plainly (and why not, if you're making an angry white guy movie you may as well crib from the best) but the influences here are far more diverse. Obviously there are One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next vibes (British institution classic Scum too) but there is also Francis Ford Coppola flop One From the Heart and old French classic The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. If its predecessor was a funhouse mirror reflection of a comic book movie, this film is the reflection of that original reflection, any DNA of a DC world unrecognisable.

And there are songs, lots of songs. Phillips has said he was reluctant to call the movie a musical because the idea of a musical is that you leave the cinema happy and you won't be smiling after this. He's not wrong (more on that later) but there's another reason that moniker doesn't quite fit, the songs don't advance the narrative. A tune's function here is a trip to fantasy land to explore a characters state of mind, not a line of communication between writer and audience. The visuals and performances during the songs are pretty great. Phoenix proved in 2005's Walk the Line that he can sing but what he does this time is completely different. Arthur is no songbird, raspy and off key he ambles his way through the songs but with such feeling it feels like hearing these classics for the first time. When Frank Sinatra sings about finally finding somebody you know he's never really had such difficulties, when Arthur sings it every word means everything to him. Lady Gaga might be even better. We know she can sing and she's perfectly melodic here, but not perfect. Just a little too slow, just a little off tune. Completely fitting for a character hiding the true extent of herself.

In terms of style, cinematography and emotion Folie A Deux is top notch. In terms of narrative through line it is lacking. The main story component is the courtroom drama but the film's unconventional nature means there is none of the cut and thrust that propels such scenes in other movies. We spend more time going over and recontextualising the events of the previous film than experiencing new ones. It's not a case of style over substance, it's just that the substance is in the observing rather the doing.

The other barrier to entry is that the film is pretty relentlessly grim. While Joker showed the world through Arthur's eyes, Folie A Deux shows the world's view of Arthur and it is not pleasant. Seen only as either a figure of hatred or ridicule, or a symbol of violent power, nobody gives a toss about the man behind the persona. He is, lest we forget, a multiple murderer so you can argue nobody should care but the system that ignored him first time round now takes great delight in punching him in the face. I'm sure this isn't the direction people who revelled in the previous films violent third act wanted Arthur's story to go but it feels like a natural progression for such a character. The film makers seem fully aware of the response their movie will get from certain sections of the fanbase and have made that a major part of the narrative.

Whether you love it or hate it (they are likely to be the only two reactions), the talent behind Joker: Folie A Deux cannot be denied and it stands as a triumph of creative ambition over bean counting. It will bemuse and infuriate plenty of the original movies fans and likely burn a hole in the pocket of Warner Brothers but will live in the memory and conversation long after a traditional sequel would have been forgotten.

10.0,16 October 2024,"Before whilst reading all the negative reviews but loving the first film I decided I was just going to go and make up my own mind!

After: I'm so glad I did , I honestly totally enjoyed this...... and anyone who didn't, didn't get it fully..... wasn't bored for one minute..... There was so many hidden Easter eggs within the film and laid the foundations for another dark universe within the whole Batman theology..... I think Phillips deserves an Oscar for the film and it is a beautiful compliment to the first film whilst also maintaining its own as a totally valid sequel.....

Soundtrack was awesome. Gaga was great.

Honestly 9/10...... I thought it was brilliant, and I'm a hard-core Batman fan

10.0,2 October 2024,"A very intriguing and at times disturbing storyline, the film truly is by definition 'Folie a Deux', it prompts you to think more about the origin of the Joker and what happened to make him the way he is, and that 'Lee' Lady Gaga's character is the perfect companion for the Joker, she creates the balance even if it is within the madness. Absolutely worth going to see! Lady Gaga's performance is a stand out in the film, she could perhaps have been utilised more in it if I was to try to find a criticism, her transition from the music industry to film is one like I've never seen before, she seems to 'live and breathe' as the character she plays in the films she's in which makes you completely forget that it's 'Lady Gaga' she melts into the role."
10.0,19 October 2024,
10.0,15 October 2024,Forget about the DC story or the script. The acting in the movie is genius. Joaquin takes you on A ride and shows you exactly what the Joker is really thinking. And how insane the Joker is. Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors of our time. And the movie needs to be commended for that reason alone. Lady Gaga as Harley Quin is perfect for the role. Her music and singing fits well into the world of the Joker. Harley also has her own fantasy of life and wants to live in it. Not the real world of where she comes from. Together they both take into the insane but beautiful mind of the Joker. I loved this movie and thought it was very entertaining.
10.0,15 October 2024,"People watched this film with pre-concieved expectations, for the joker to descend into complete chaos and mischief.....but people weren't ready to accept Arthur Fleck as a remorseful human being. Harlay Quinn is almost a metaphor for the negative reaction this film is getting and represents that audience/negativity.

I feel it's a lazy description of this film to call it a musical, yes there's plenty of music but I think it's truly reflective of their mental states and whether they are delusions or not.

This is the destruction of the Joker alter ego Arthur had and the rise of Harlay Quinn.....there's more to her character and I feel we're just scratching the surface with her."
10.0,11 October 2024,"Amazing Joaquín Phoenix a pleasure to see him perform on this beautiful psycho thriller-drama. Intense feelings through out the movie. Perfection. Sad to see ppl who loves Hero nonsense movies give bad critics to such a wonderful production. As my title states if film's name was Arthur Flek would have 9/10+ stars. Congrats to Gaga too, not an actor but she did fine, a humble and decent person can feel this movie and gets into the role so well. They matched so well on this. Finally, good job to all who contributed to this film , really well lit amazing quality, depth on every level sound , effects, actors! A pleasure to watch!"
10.0,14 October 2024,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I immediately went and watched the first joker movie. Within minutes I knew the second movie was going to be phenomenal. First, Lady Gaga is always a good choice. Second, if Lady Gaga is in the movie she's going to sing. Thirdly, the music enhances the movie. Not only is it fantastic music, but it helps to tell the story, and it helps to show each character's frame of mind, and how they were connected, even if in reality they never met. They were both delusional. They lived in a state of madness. That's the point. I'm not sure why this movie resonated so hard with me, but it did. It's entirely possible that the brilliance of using all of the incarnations of the character, joker, that we have been exposed to since his inception, Gives us a full picture of exactly how the character processed information inside of his own brain. If you're one of the people that does not understand this movie, I pity you. I wonder if it was just too nuanced for the average person. I wonder if it just went over peoples heads, the use of all of the symbolism. I hope it didn't. I hope people go back and watch this movie a second time and realize that , the camera angles, the exact words that were spoken the songs that were utilized, and the timing in which those songs were played was perfection."
10.0,15 October 2024,"If you didn't like this film you are religious. What we are looking for is...logic. LOGIC over dogma. Logically enjoy the madness.

Was the film expertly produced, the acting outstanding, did time ease by, did it not entertain!

Sure they were quick to the singing in every scene. Balance could have been achieved with more drama, more character interactions and some cell wall head banging. A bit of explicit trauma before delving in to the dancy mind of the mad.

You can slate the visualization of the thoughts of the insanely fantastical, but that is unfair. This film in the arch of what may inspire The Joker to transpire, is substantive enough to stand a test of time.

Had the pleasure of seeing in BFI IMAX, it stands up on that scale, I would recommend viewing it over stubbornly giving it a pass. This is cinema."

I found that it was a very accurate representation of mental illness in film especially constantly switching between fantasy and reality. I adored the first film and while this was quite different I also really enjoyed this one. There wasn't nearly as much singing as made out to be online and seriously if you don't like musicals why go watch a musical? The only thing I didn't like was how messy and rushed the ending seemed but this definitely didn't ruin it for me. So if you are worried about the reviews but enjoyed the first movie and understand it's a musical, definitely give it a shot. I will also add that I found this one to be a bit more graphic than the first one with some slightly triggering scenes."
10.0,13 October 2024,"I think that most negative reviewing of this movie stems from the assumed ""mis-selling"" of what the movie is going to be. I say ""assumed"" because the movie isn't sold with any premise. I think many (myself included), expected a progression of the jokers story, from the first movie's origin notes, to perhaps his rise to crime lord and Batman's nemesis. Spoiler alert : it doesn't do this. Rather the movie continues to explore the twisted mind and personality of Arthur flex. Joaquin is fantastic as ever at portraying this broken and unstable character and the cinema-photography is beautiful.

In essence this movie does what it does amazingly well. It's shouldn't be put down for breaking moulds and expectations. In fact it should be highly praised for doing so. We need more of this not the derivative formulation bs that is usually piped out of Hollywood."

Arthur Fleck uses music to escape his reality and makes perfect sense in the context of the film, considering the trauma he has experienced throughout his life and continues to experience.

The music fit seamlessly into the storyline and was really moving. Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix gave phenomenal performances and I strongly advise people to be open minded when watching because it is pleasantly surprising."
10.0,6 October 2024,"Everyone in the theater hated it, but I loved it and saw it for what it was. You just have to watch it through the right kind of eyes. It's not a movie. It's a balladic interpretive artpiece that realistically juxtaposes mental illness against the backdrop of our justice system while disguised as a Broadway musical birthed out of the new and innovative anti-comic style. It can't be given a name. Human society isn't ready for it yet.

Most people sitting in the theater will either be counting the seconds until it's over, or be walking out. It's less about raw entertainment, and more about serving as a mirror to society. It was as if the talent and director were given complete creative freedom, and pushed it to the maximum with little regard for monetary return. It challenges what it means to be mentally ill, as well as questioning our believed differences between justice and punishment -correction and rehabilitation.

Are all criminals guilty of their crimes, or do we as a whole society share some of that guilt for not trying hard enough to enforce our societal integrity?"
8.0,6 October 2024,"I absolutely love how the story of the Joker is being shared. Geeesh, Mr. Phoenix brings the Joker to life visually as well as mentally and the musical touch actually takes the tone of the film where it needs to be adding such intimate detail!!!!! Lady Gaga ....great supporting role!!! She was absolutely amazing!!!! The film is such a quiet chaotic work of art that I can truly appreciate being a true fan of the Joker. The writers behind this film really brings this story to life exploring and explaining in great detail the comic book historians identity for sure. From actors to the story line to the musical selections this is definitely a great treat for us Joker fans!!!!"

8.0,5 October 2024,"This next installment for the Joker really was excellent! I never looked at my watch during the entire movie. The creativity and attention to detail by the director, special effects, deep story shots were so well planned. I was really blown away by the show tunes that both characters sang at important areas of the film, some lighter some darker. Granted, this is a very violent, dark film not for the sensitive viewer. I study each film that I see and take notes. The amazing colors used too at different points of the film were very inventive and held your attention. It goes more deeply about the Jokers upbringing and hard life he has had than the first film. It also showed abuse as an adult that for most sensitive people could be tough to watch, but I invite you to see other creative points of this....dare I say, Oscar worthy film. I believe Mr. Phoenix could get an Oscar for his exceptional acting as he threw himself totally into his character. Lady Gaga could also may get an award too for her wonderful performance and her gift of her singing. This is the best movie of the year so far in my opinion."
8.0,20 October 2024,"Excellent film!

Everyone hating it, simply doesn't get it..

It's a film about the continued decline of the Arthur/Jokers mental health and a semi-love story.. creating a false reality to hide, split personality disorder and the pain of trauma and living with a devil inside.

This is a perfect avenue for a character such as Joker.

It touches perfectly to the comics and the insanity Joker is/was.. he isn't just portrayed as a ""crazy villian"".. he is complex, damaged and vulnerable. That's the point.

Folie A Deux is a continuation from part 1, do not expect a ""Batman"" film.. you won't get it."

Although, Gaga's barely in the movie I wanted more of her scenes there are so many scenes in the trailer that its not part of the movie and Gaga is such a eye-catching everytime she appears to the screen she really gets your attention easily - The ending of the movie feels like its hard to digest Todd really destroys the story line I have no problems being musical their singing was amazing, but story line is kinda off but overall I enjoyed watching the film! Kudos to all the cast and crew!"
8.0,11 October 2024,"Just came back from the theatre for a second viewing of Folie a Deux and loved it again.

Joker: Folie à Deux is nothing short of mesmerizing. It takes the raw, gritty essence of the first film and layers it with an almost surreal intensity. Joaquin Phoenix, once again, gives a masterclass performance, but this time with the added complexity of a musical twist. The chemistry between Phoenix and Lady Gaga is electric-she brings a whole new dimension to Harley Quinn, not just as Joker's partner, but as a standalone force. The cinematography is stunning, with each shot feeling like a piece of dark, twisted art. And the music! It's haunting, blending seamlessly with the chaos unfolding on screen. This sequel doesn't just repeat the success of the first movie-it expands on it, dives deeper, and makes you think about the madness that exists within all of us. Absolutely brilliant from start to finish!"
9.0,9 October 2024,"Firstly, I am an avid moviegoer and with my wife would like to watch most films and give them all a chance.

The original joker film I found very dark and gritty but was an amazing and well acted. Film and Phoenix deserved the Oscar and the film deserved success but it's a film that would probably never watch again.. This film, however was still dark and gritty but with the amazing performance by Gaga Together with another brilliant performance by Phoenix and the musical twist of these two singing to each other was truly inventive and amazing and added to the plot while breaking up some of the gritty parts to make it a much more enjoyable film while telling such an awesome story.

I believe Gaga and Phoenix both deserve Oscars for their performances and would make Phoenix a legend for possibly getting to Oscars for playing the same character. Why the reviews and scores are solo on this is unbelievable because it is way better than what these people are saying.."

Personally, I am content with the final product. I love the cinematography, every little detail took me deeper into Arthur's mind, I must admit that when I found out it was a musical I thought it might ruin the film but no, in my opinion it really shows how they escape reality with music and their little fantasy world...one thing that did kind of threw me off is the ending..I feel it's not like the traditional characters from comics and other movies but in a nutshell it's a good film."
10.0,6 October 2024,"I wrote a really long review and it isn't appearing now. I rated it 10/10 and imdb changed it to 3/10 which is appalling.

A great film. Internal drama, not a shoot 'em up.

Brilliant performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.

Showed the impact of trauma, the gift that keeps on giving.

Touches on celebrity culture and inauthenticity, feeling lost and without foundation and clinging to someone in/famous.

Kindnesses, cruelties, coping mechanisms, dissociation, fragmentation with jumping to different times in his life, imagined scenes and musical interludes. Loved these.

Please know I rated this a 10 and if it's downgraded ill know not yo trust imdb scores ever again."
9.0,10 October 2024,"The movie focuses on the relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn, so many people forget who Harley is and her personality. Despite this, the movie is still enjoyable and introduces a larger concept. In the Batman cartoon, Lee Quinzel is always singing, so I don't understand why people are surprised by this in the movie. What did they expect? I appreciate that they didn't change her personality. Perhaps many of us can't accept a deeper view of the characters and stories in the Batman universe, but I believe that if they continue to make movies and series about the same characters in this way, Batman and every superhero will become stale. I like how they are starting to care about other characters; this will revitalize the story."

10.0,5 October 2024,"Being already so invested in the Joker's character from the original Joker, I wasn't expecting the movie to be what it was. Although knowing the Joker's character Arthur Fleck is mentally ill it was definitely complementary that they portrayed a lot of the feelings & scenes through songs. Certainly not a paradox, Joker was psychotic and delusional (schizophrenic?) And ironically loved how music was used as he seemed most happy when he was singing. As we all know music therapy is great for mental health.

Would certainly say I would have liked a bit of action in there and certainly the possibility of a further movie."
8.0,10 October 2024,"This movie is nowhere near as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's different than what you're expecting. Yes, it's a strange musical, but I was very entertained and that's all that matters. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I think all the bad reviews helped me like me more because my expectations were pretty low, so I tried to turn my brain off and watch with an open mind. This might be a strange comparison, but I compare this movie to the spirit of Rob Zombie's Halloween II because it was so different than the original.

Two years have passed since the events of the original Joker and Arthur Fleck is still locked up in Arkham Asylum. He keeps to himself and awaiting trial for the events of the original. He soon meets Harley Quinn (dubbed 'Lee' in this movie) played brilliantly by Lady Gaga. Arthur and Lee hit it off quickly because she has an obsession with the 'Joker' persona.

This is where it becomes a musical and shows what it's like inside their minds. Some of the scenes that look like a Broadway musical are shot beautifully. It's interesting how it goes from gorgeous psychotic musical, to a courtroom case. I find courtroom scenes very interesting, so I was never bored with it.

Arthur soon realizes that the 'Joker' persona has taken a life of its own and there are people in Gotham who are obsessed with him, but will he live up to their expectations? If you loved the original, and can keep an open mind, I would highly recommend JOKER: FOLIE A' DEUX!!!"
9.0,5 October 2024,"Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers a staggering performance in the Joker sequel, proving that his Oscar win was no fluke. Five years later, his portrayal of the infamous villain is even more nuanced and electrifying, with the film's musical elements adding a new layer to his already extraordinary craft. Lady Gaga breathes life into the film with her equally compelling performance, showcasing her raw talent and undeniable screen presence. While the story may feel somewhat lacking at times, it's the mesmerizing chemistry and powerhouse acting of Phoenix and Gaga that elevate the film to unforgettable heights, making it a true spectacle of talent."

10.0,10 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux: I can't understand all the hate about this film, yes it's different, what did they expect? A carbon copy? Joker: Folie à Deux os musical drama, a courtroom drama, a tale of grim times in early 1980s Gotham which mirrors New York. The Joker/Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel (Lady Gaga) perform duets and sing alone. Harleen is also a patient in Arkham, during a film show she sets fire to a piano and she and the Joker then dance and sing away into the yard. The joker ends up being punished. Most of their duets are fantasy numbers in the Joker's imagination, dancing on the roof of Hotel Arkham, on their own show. Outside of the courtroom where the Joker is being tried, Harleen sings That's entertainment. This is a different Harleen, not psychotic, more of a narcissistic sociopath and manipulator, not always a reliable narrator. She's not a super villain just like Joker isn't. Indeed Joker's lawyer Maryanne Stewart (Catherine Keener) wants to use a dissociative identity disorder defence showing that Arthur Fleck's ""Joker"" personality is responsible for the crimes and Fleck is innocent if insane. The guards in Arkham are sadistic, a senior guard, Jackie Sullivan (Brendan Gleeson), though brutal, helps Arthur Fleck to meet up with Harleen at a singing group and the film show. Their relationship is similar to that between the SS Officer and the Jewish prisoner who made him laugh, in Schindler's List. Joker: Folie à Deux isn't as good as Joker but it's not a bad film. Great performances by Phoenix and Gaga with good support from Gleeson and Keener. The film opens with an animated sequence which sums up the dual nature of Joker/Fleck. A violent film, which is disturbing, though the plot line will make you think, wondering which of Fleck's scenes with Harleen (other than musical numbers) were fantasies. Directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay he co-wrote with Scott Silver. 7.5/10."

9.0,14 October 2024,"First IMDB review.

It may not be something you'll rewatch every year, but I'm glad some people out there are still taking risks in the entertainment industry, even when it doesn't translate to profit.

The controversial musical aspect may be hit or miss sometimes (though this is highly subjective), but it does dare to be different from the usual Marvel clones and most of the bland action-comedy movies that try to follow in those footsteps. This isn't a movie about ""the traditional Joker"" character you know. And it's far from any other comic book-based adaptation (good and bad elements included).

It can be difficult to watch at times, but I did enjoy the focus on the prison conditions and the trial that follows the events of the 1st Joker movie.

Some events in the movie have (understandably) turned many people off, especially if you're expecting a traditional tour de force display from Joker against the injustices of society and a take on the character that's closer to what you know or expect from Joker. I also needed some time to take it in.

Still, I think I'm beginning to see the point and how it forms a full picture together with the first movie. This isn't a film about comic book characters going on a rampage, it's an introspective tragedy about someone with mental illness who is let down by everyone around him (the system, his family, his workplace, and even his followers).

It's about someone who owns up to his crimes even despite his illness and the things he had to endure. This makes the movie even more tragic because it lets you believe that none of this would have happened with the right help and environment.

I think this is a good story about the grotesque inequalities in big cities (Gotham fits the bill for many real-world examples) and blindly following celebrities and being angry, even enraged when they don't behave according to the image you have of them in your head (many real-world examples come to mind here as well).

After all, how dare Arthur not be the Joker all of us expected him to be, right?"
8.0,9 October 2024,"Firstly, it's not a musical, there's just some singing. The only time there's really a dance routine is during a fire.

The sequel follows the same themes as the first film, a descent into madness by a man who's been let down by family and society, but going further, to his full descent when he's let down by the person he loves, after finally finding connection.

I simply do not understand what people don't get about the film. If you don't like the sequel, you never really got the first.

Gaga and Phoenix are excellent, together and singley. Gaga's costume design on transformation to Harley Quinn is perfect, Joker remains appropriately ramshackle and grimm.

The grimy, miserable setting continues, I think we could have had more contrast, as we did with Wayne Manor in the first.

The triggering of Fleck's psychotic break was difficult to watch."
8.0,12 October 2024,"In the first movie Phoenix and the director degraded the Joker character into a spineless, blubbering and snottering loser. Every lifelong Joker fan who -righteously- complained that they simply butchered the entire Joker character in that despicable abomination got told by the horde of Joaquin Phoenix fans to stop whining and ""just look at it as a spin off or an alternative version of Joker"" or ""it's how he BECAME the Joker"" or ""just look at the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix and put a sock in it""...and that type of nonsense. Well, I suggest that all you superfans of the first movie look at this amazing work of art as a spin off on how Joker met Harley and what an amazing performance Joaquin Phoenix and Gaga put on display. Think of it as an alternative universe where supervillains are losers who love to sing. This amazing musical gets a 10/10 from me, just for giving all the obnoxious stanboys a taste of their own medicine."
10.0,10 October 2024,"This isn't a hero or regular movie with predictable characters, it's a psycho movie, there is a lot of a construction of a bad guy and more then why it's how it happens, most of it isn't really and only happens inside his head. I liked the movie, not better than the first one but for sure a great movie, different of what we have normally. Like the first one, all unpredictable scenes and strong attachment to the first movie. Can you imagine the characters are mixing the real actors? The musical idea is wonderful and original. What I didn't like is the place discussion for so long and could be more casual."
9.0,5 October 2024,"A fitting end to this tragic, beautiful story. Many people went into this film wanting a true Joker origin story. This was a story about Arthur Fleck finally taking accountability. For some people that will never sit right. Joaquin Phoenix truly embodies Arthur/Joker. Lady Gaga's version of Harley was low key, and cold hearted. With hints of her psychological background, she is a master manipulator. I hate musicals. Yet this movie is elevated by the delusional melodies within Arthur's head. If you don't like the ending of this movie well, ""that's life"". I highly recommend watching this movie.."

9.0,8 October 2024,"Not like the first Joker movie which was a masterpiece but this Joker 2 was awesome because I enjoyed the movie and being a love story between Joker and Harley it was ok to be a musical one.

I called it ""The Arkham Asylum Love Story"". 🤗😍

I watched it on Dolby Atmos and it was very good, the sound effects and music was super good, the entire movie was well filmed and the actors was super popular. The face expression of the Joker and Arthur Fleck was the best even much better than the previous Joker movie, it was that face expression of a true sick and madness killer.

I really love all the Warner Bros movies, characters, actors and producers... they're really professionals.

I really recommend this movie which is definitely a must see."
9.0,9 October 2024,"There is something to be said about the great American song book. Perhaps saying it through the lens of The Joker is not the best choice.

The sequel to 2019's Joker may be an unspoken promise to Joker fans that by purchasing a ticket, they will be entertained by ... more of the same. But it's not.

As a film, this production stands on its own. Gaga delivers a solid performance for a singer/entertainer. And, she introduces a new take on the American songbook to a new audience thus extending the preservation of great songs and delivering them through accessible performances. Phoenix is his usual excellent self plus he sings...and sings and acts...and sings and performs. To assert that there is no redeeming value in that is plain unbridled ignorance...but given that Donald Trump can actually compel half of American voters to vote for him, we are clearly dealing with an intellectually stunted audience to begin with.

For those with brains more complex than a mass of reactive neurons, keep an open mind and see the film as a freestanding submission with an artful application of loved and adored musical tunes.

Would the typical Joker audience show up at a film expecting a musical? Unlikely.... So perhaps viewers feel burned or robbed of the entertainment they wanted. Boo hoo.

For the rest of us, we get powerhouse performances and great music. Odd? Yes. Thought provoking? Yes. Mindless entertainment that latches on to one's nose-bound cattle ring which allows any force to manipulate them like a member of a heard in one direction or the other? Nope. Sorry. If you want brainless ... go to a Trump rally."
8.0,18 October 2024,"Great title, great movie.

I had heard tiny bits about 'Joker: Folie à Deux' falling below expectations since its release, though they weren't substantial enough to know if the film was any good or not. I have to say, I really enjoyed watching it all play out. It admittedly isn't on the same level as the phenomenal predecessor, but that's OK - I wasn't expecting it to be.

I will say that making this a musical of sorts was a bold choice, it wouldn't have been the direction that I would've went with it but to be honest I thought they executed it nicely. I presume that is one reason many didn't like this, as well as possibly the lack of craziness that seemed like it was on the horizon based on the 2019 flick. For me, mind, it all works.

Joaquin Phoenix is as excellent as anticipated in his reprisal as Joker, while Lady Gaga is a neat piece of casting for Lee - obviously her music chops for one, though I do enjoy her acting too. Lee perhaps could've been used more, but what we got is more than sufficient in my opinion. Brendan Gleeson, elsewhere, does well in a more minor role.

Is is slightly overlong? Possibly. Did we need a sequel? Probably not. All I can confirm is that I had a positive time viewing it, so I can't harbour any noteworthy complaints. It's a shame to now read that this film has seemingly bombed in more ways than one. C'est la vie."
10.0,8 October 2024,"A multi-layered psychological drama that explores the masks people wear to fit into society, highlighting the desire for validation and the price of seeking social acceptance.

The etymology of the word person: from Latin persona - a strategic mask of identity in public, the public image of one's personality, the social role that one adopts, or simply a fictional character. It is also considered ""an intermediary between the individual and the institution.""

Thank you, Joaquin! ❤

Go and watch it without expectations, and enjoy the amazing acting, photography, and music! Relax... Stop having expectations!

David Bowie's song 'I'm Afraid of America' would be a perfect fit..."
10.0,3 October 2024,"I really liked the movie! The mind of Arthur Fleck is musical, demented and full blown crazy. The charisma between Phoenix and Gaga, and all the music lands perfectly. Lady Gaga is a much better Harley Quinn than Margo Robbie. And Joaquin Phoenix is absolutely brilliant.

If Joaquin Phoenix doesn't sweep the awards next year from The Joker 2 I'll be very shocked. Between this film and The Penguin this year, DC is on fire.

Also, the return of a few characters from the original film during the court trial was a nice addition.

I highly recommend this movie. Don't expect an epic violent film. Prepare for a well written dramatic look at the mind of an insane killer."
10.0,11 October 2024,
9.0,6 October 2024,"Overall, the musical content of the film was extremely lacking. However, the policeman who sang at the group class was perhaps the saving grace of the entire film. It's clear that he (or the over-dub) has had extensive training and/or experience in singing. While Lady Gaga is well accomplished, her voice leans excessively pop-y and lacks gravitas in many of the scenes where you would hope for such. Joaquin Phoenix's voice was also unfitting for most of the songs they chose for him. He is clearly not a trained musical actor, so I cannot fault him for this, but the musical direction surely could have chosen things that fit his gruff and unrefined voice instead of forcing him up some registers and leaving the rest to autotune."
10.0,8 October 2024,"The movie & all the cast was great, maybe the problem is too much songs on the movie, Some of the songs were great and beautiful But I wish there was no exaggeration in the number of songs, as if it were a musical movie,Overall the movie is great and exciting.

Joaquin's performance was very special and realistic as if he was not acting, Lady Gaga's performance was special and wonderful, the police's performance was special and realistic, all the crew members were wonderful and I would also like to thank the wonderful director for the fantastic directing, the dreamy soundtrack, and the advanced fantastic photography."
10.0,8 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a mesmerizing, twisted masterpiece that deepens the psychological exploration of Arthur Fleck and the Joker. The title, Folie à Deux, translates to ""Madness for Two,"" which perfectly encapsulates the film's central theme: the shared madness between Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn. In this sequel, fans are treated to an intense study of two distinct personas-the broken, fragile Arthur and the malevolent Joker. While Arthur longs for connection and understanding, Harley is drawn solely to the chaos and danger that is the Joker.

For fans of the classic Harley and Joker romance, this film delivers. Harley only ever wanted one thing: the Joker, not the man behind the makeup. Her obsession with the idea of him drives the narrative forward, creating a dynamic that is both toxic and riveting. Their relationship is a dance of destruction, echoing the chaos that has always defined the Joker's story. This is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys the darker side of love and villainy.

Visually, Folie à Deux is nothing short of stunning. The cinematography is a feast for the eyes, with every shot meticulously crafted to mirror Arthur's descent into madness. From the gritty setting of Arkham to the vibrant, yet unnerving musical numbers, the visuals pull the audience deeper into Arthur's fractured psyche. The musical elements play a key role here, much like in the first film, where the infamous stair dance and the bathroom scene hinted at Arthur's unraveling mind. In this sequel, the musical sequences go even further, especially the ones in Court; offering a surreal, almost hypnotic lens into his mental breakdown. It's a clever device that keeps viewers disoriented, much like Arthur himself.

And let's talk about Joaquin Phoenix. If Joker wasn't enough to convince audiences, Folie à Deux solidifies his status as the definitive Joker. Phoenix brings an intensity to the role that no other actor has quite captured. Heath Ledger, (who Phoenix' is often compared too) while phenomenal, was just one piece of an ensemble in The Dark Knight. Phoenix, however, owns the Joker's story entirely across two films, showcasing the character's complexities in a way that Ledger's performance, as brilliant as it was, didn't have the opportunity to do. Phoenix makes the Joker more than a villain-he makes him a tragic, compelling figure, and his performance here will go down as one of the greatest portrayals in comic book movie history.

In short, Joker: Folie à Deux is a must-see for fans of the character. The film is visually striking, narratively bold, and anchored by two unforgettable performances from Phoenix and Lady Gaga. The movie delves deep into the Joker's psyche, taking viewers on a chaotic, beautiful, and unsettling ride."

Their dynamic feels natural, revealing different sides of both characters-good, bad, crazy, and real. The singing (musical) aspect adds an amazing, and comical layer, blending seamlessly into the story. The film's transition between reality and delusion makes you question what's real, enhancing the overall experience.

We are taken on a magical mystery tour of his mind and mental state as he meets Harley Quinn for the first time. Lady Gaga does not disappoint in this role and joins Joker on his Journey of discovery. Many people have had to deal with trauma or psychological abuse at some point in their lives and music is the glue that ignites these characters. Letting the audience go further down the rabbit hole. Sad funny and hugely enjoyable movie.it leaves me wanting more and with a lot of questions to ask as to where the story goes next

Loved it. X."
9.0,14 October 2024,"I think it's a smart movie, slow at times, but I think it needs that pace to develop the emotions and explanations. It follows on from where the last movie left off and it explores Arthur's mental health further and deeper.

I think it sends powerful messages about how we view heroes and antiheroes.

It's telling of the problems we face today: people are so polarized, even about a movie like this one.

It's a very unique origin story presented in a way that seems to upset a lot of fans.

If the reviews don't improve now, I think that this movie will stand the test of time and be revisited as a classic."
10.0,10 October 2024,"The plot is straightforward on one level and flows naturally from the 2019 film. The production is rich and captivating. The acting is superb. The underlying theme addresses the subjective notion of madness. The use of show tunes is clever and adds depth to the subtext.

I am glad not to have followed the avalanche of negative crticism which focuses on the absence of plot and objection to the use of music, both of which, to the contrary, are strengths. Many claim the film is boring and this baffles me as, unlike films which are filled with lengthy dialog spoken is a low tone or which are little more than over-produced chase scenes or shoot-outs, Folie á Deux is thoughtfully constructed throughout."
8.0,11 October 2024,"I saw Joker: Folie a deux ( shared madness) in spite of the critical reviews. I liked this movie and I can't understand all the hate. Phoenix's performance was as good as the first movie. Brendan Gleeson, as always, was a great support actor as an asylum guard.

I would not classify Joker 2 as a musical. There were musical scenes in the movie but these sequences were, mostly, played out in the mind of a very mentally sick and unstable individual. These scenes gave us an insight into the warped mind of Arthur Fleck (Joker).

I found the ending of the movie satisfyingly unexpected.

The movie was well acted and well directed."
10.0,18 October 2024,
8.0,8 October 2024,"Don't understand the hate, really good - carried the social commentary of the first film while daring to be different and express the torment of the character through song. Only criticism is that some parts are slow, and maybe so many songs wasn't wholly necessary to the plot. The acting is still incredible with Joaquin Phoenix especially - it didn't give the typical ending, which is fitting to the character and his background. Maybe it's not to everyone's taste, but I think it is being judged more harshly than needed, but that's just my opinion. At least, I don't know how anyone could call a part musical, part prison film, part courtroom drama boring."
10.0,18 October 2024,"I understand why some people might not like the film, if you're looking for a carbon copy of the first one, with the addition of a cute actress for eye candy, you'll be woefully disappointed.

The film depicts delusion through music and artistic caricature-esque cut scenes, you're not looking at joker from the outside as a third person viewer looking down at a person with mental illness, you're in the delusions with him, experiencing them with him!

This film is takes a microscope to the characters and you feel as they feel, it brings about so much empathy and it does it creatively. When you look at this as a whole piece, connected to the first, the unravelling of the character is done in such a way that you almost feel like you're in there with him ( that you are him). Acting from both Joaquin phoenix and lady gaga is fantastic too, really surprised more people didn't enjoy this."
10.0,15 October 2024,"Review & Rating: Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring, unconventional sequel that ventures deep into the twisted psyche of Arthur Fleck, blending psychological drama with musical elements. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film embraces a bold shift by integrating musical numbers that offer a surreal, theatrical contrast to the dark, violent world of Gotham. Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an intense performance as Arthur, his character's mental instability mirrored in both the narrative and the musical sequences. Lady Gaga, portraying Lee Quinzel (a version of Harley Quinn), adds complexity to the story, with her musical numbers providing emotional depth and a wild, chaotic energy.

The musical approach is polarizing; for some, it adds layers of insight into Arthur's fractured mind, while for others, it feels disjointed from the gritty realism of the original film. Despite some narrative and pacing issues, the film is visually arresting and offers a unique experience, filled with both moments of brilliance and chaos.

Rating: 8/10 Though not without its flaws, Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and innovative continuation of the Joker saga, providing a provocative, albeit divisive, cinematic experience."
10.0,4 October 2024,Folie à Deux was phenomenal!!! Gaga's acting gets better with each project. Joaquin did amazing as expected and his singing was impressive. His chemistry with Gaga was seamless. The social commentary and dual identity themes stood out for me. The seemingly convoluted scenes that seem to not flow were meant to represent mental illness and Arthur's use of music to cope with the calamities of his life. Some will get it and love it. Some will not get it and focus on the fact that it doesn't have same structure as the first film or follow DC cannon. It is the nature of idols to be built up and torn down. All in all a superb sequel! I gasped at several scenes and did not expect the ending in a good way. I do wish Lee and Arthur's relationship was hashed out a bit more and I was looking forward to see Lee Quinzel go full on crazy at the end. All in all one of the top films for me this year.
10.0,8 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is not about Joker, it's about Arthur Fleck's illness and how mental health is treated and seen by society, especially by those who have higher status power in society. This film portrays those who have mental illness as the bottom of society. People in higher power in the film try to brush off Arthur's illness as fake as this is what would lead society to just move on after his death sentence. People in higher status view that death is a better answer to mental illness than try and help those who suffer. This is clearly presented in the opening animated short.

If you have already seen the movie give it another go with this new perception that you may not have seen on a first watch (I personally realised the larger themes in this film on a second watch). If you haven't seen Joker: Folie à Deux give it a watch and don't go off from bad reviews, make your own opinion.

I have to ask anyone just spam hating this film just because you hate musicals, please remove your rating."
10.0,16 October 2024,"Personally I thought it was an interesting, layered film. One can enjoy it as a (dysfunctional) love story, anti-musical, psychological thriller and courtroom drama. The acting is outstanding. Of course Joaquin Phoenix delivered, but honestly I was surprised that Lady Gaga was on a par with him.

Most importantly, for me, this movie incorporated some social commentary, focussing on police/state violence. It did a decent job of problematizing it while staying honest about the psychological damage it inflicts and the sustainability of state violence. It's an interesting device, to employ the Joker as a prism through which we can understand the madness of the modern world. Instead we just watched a guy falling off the deep end.

Admittedly, the ending did leave me a little empty. However, this feeling pales in comparison to viewing the unfolding of this film's reception. Wtf is wrong with everybody?"
9.0,14 October 2024,"Surprisingly good movie. Glad I didn't listen to all the self declared critics that hate everything and only post hate. I just went and saw this movie. Contrary to the haters, go see it and judge for yourself. This movie is quite good and it's not a musical. There is some singing in dream sequences but it can't be 15 minute of the movie. There's no singing dialogue and people just don't know what a musical is. This movie was very entertaining and disturbing here and there. I expected I wouldn't like it based on the comments but I should have realized most people just post hate and most people haven't seen it. Looking forward to seeing it again."

10.0,8 October 2024,"I might be one of the only people that enjoys and still gets excited for a sequel made by Todd Phillips. I enjoy The Hangover 2 and I enjoyed Joker Deux and as long as it doesn't turn into a trilogy I'm happy because the third Hangover was truly terrible.

However there are a few things that bother me about the movie: the singing was a bit much for my taste and the ending was confusing and yet disappointing all at once.

I don't understand the story either nor does it really have one, the first Joker doesn't really have a clear storyline either but it still made sense in a lot more ways the second one.

Still, I do believe the movie is genuinely good and for a fun cinematic experience with a loved one it's a good choice and a few laughs here and there and a tiny tear shed during a certain witness testimony scene is a guarantee."

10.0,13 October 2024,"The actors put on an incredible show, the depth of the direction was excellent, and the production was spot on.

If you like the new pop marvel trash, this is not that. This is darker than the dark knight and requires to you immerse yourself in the characters.

I love a film that doesn't distract me and this film had me engaged in the characters all the way. I'm not a fan of musicals and I didn't feel like I was watching a musical.

I can understand that people walked in with expectations and were disappointed, I haven't watched a DC film since Frank Millers adaptations so I had no problem with expectations. I generally do not like DC films, I prefer their animations."
10.0,8 October 2024,"First of all, thank you to all involved in making the film, especially Lady GaGa and Phoenix. MY LADY, you did an excellent job again with this movie.

What I learned from this, is that no matter how hard was our past/childhood, there is always a fantasy that keeps us moving on. It is a dramatic story and the music intensifies the tragedy. In some parts it is very hard to digest the action.

Lee was there for Joker because she felt in love with this fantasy of him. I didn't mind the music it was like a flavor and in my opinion GaGa's voice was the best.

I liked it very much, I'm very proud of LG !!"
10.0,13 October 2024,"I do not understand all the hate for this movie. I was highly entertained. When Joker broke out into song the first time, I got chills. And got chills several times thereafter. The cinematography was excellent. Joaquin was doing Joaquin things. I think the chemistry between he and Ms. Gaga was superb. This is the kind of movie I will watch over and over again just to catch what I may have missed the first 54 times. Not sure what else to say, other than again, I was highly entertained and would recommend it. I also recommend "" ""The Subtance"" Just don't watch it with your kids. Saw both this week, haven't been to the movies on years and loved them both. Peace."

10.0,19 October 2024,"The history of cinema is full of films that were a failure at their premiere but only time made them cult ones. Suddenly a spark of hate and incomprehension towards the film ignites and spreads like the hate that the character transmits throughout Gotham City itself. This is one of them. A masterpiece that does not close the story of this character but consolidates it to give impetus to what will undoubtedly, no matter how many years it takes to be shown in theaters, be a third part that will shape everything and make this trilogy a madness of inexplicable love and hate.

The Joker killed Arthur, the expectations of the Joker killed the film, spreading hate towards it like the hate that the Joker generates in fiction. The citizens of Gotham love the Joker, just as the audience in the theaters do too. Nobody loves Arthur. Nobody loves the weak and the sick. Inside, we get along better with the unmeasured force of hate that avenges everything, no matter how much we try to hide it. However, the Joker only appears when he must, he takes his time and needs to feed on the expectations of those who wait for him to embrace him.

An exciting Lady Gaga like never before makes Arthur fall in love, and she falls in love with the Joker. Arthur in his role as victim is the same disappointment for her as for many other people in the cinema seats.

A masterpiece. A beautiful musical full of sublime moments and songs."

I do not read reviews before watching movies as I don't need other peoples opinions and suggestions ruining my experience.

I go watch movies all the time, and I really enjoy the experience. This movie was funny, sad, and on edge. Very good story and I loved how they integrated many elements to create a fantastic movie.

I recommend this to everyone, even if you didn't like this movie, watch it again and stop over thinking.

Wonderful movie!!!

Todd, you did an amazing job. I work in Psychology and Hypnotherapy fields, and work with individuals who suffer with many challenges in life, and I really enjoyed how this movie was put together.

Phoenix and Gaga were amazing. This was not a Musical people, it is what we all do in life, we will start singing a song in our head or out loud to express emotions.

You need to forget about all you heard and read, and go enjoy this movie. I really enjoyed this and so did my girlfriend.

I grew up with classic Joker and Barman, all movies and I loved this style.

Amazing!!!"
8.0,13 October 2024,"As expected brilliant performances from both lead actor/actress. Don't let the musical part put you off this film because it is very short interludes of musical extravaganza. This is a great film showing the incite and fantasies inside the leading characters minds in an artistic manner,combining a touching love story and connection ,depicting how we relate and fall for people in our lives,it's a very sweet tale of two individuals.

A great variety of musical artistic content,combined with a love story and a cruel twist. A great film underated due to unrecognition of it's artistic content and lack of love in the world..."
10.0,5 October 2024,"The great concept of joker origin, the story about love and delusional world. I hate musicals, but in this case, I love hove movie shown it. In the end of the first movie it was obvious that joker is not a character, it's the idea. So I expected just what I've seen today.

Movie not for everyone for sure, but definitely for me. Origin of many characters, maybe begining of new cinematic universe, I definitely would like to see.

Grotesque of Gotham with songs of Sinatra. If you want to get something like in Nolan's movies, this one is not your choose, but when you want to feel like autumn depression kick your ass, you are welcome."
9.0,9 October 2024,"I went and saw Joker 2 today. I wasn't planning on seeing it in theater, but with all the bad press it's getting, I wondered what's so bad about it. I've been doing market research for over 7 years for the entertainment industry. I can spot a bad movie in seconds. I can spot bad acting, bad editing, bad stories, etc. According to a Google search, according to critics, joker 2 has 1.7/5 stars. I believe this rating is low, and the critics are being rough.

This is one of the few movies that came out this year from DC and one of the few movies we will see from the main actors (Joaquin Phoenix and Lady GaGa). This is probably the biggest project that DC and the actors have been working on for the entire year, and seeing it get completely obliterated by critics is disheartening. This makes it difficult for people in the industry to do their jobs and get paid. A movie set to make $250 million will not rake in even half that. We're now working overtime.

There might be a few spoilers moving forward. If you were planning on seeing it in the theater but then reconsidered, let this be the review that makes you see it while you can. It will be in its second weekend coming up this weekend. I'm not a fan of musicals, nor am I a fan of this Joker. For these reasons, I wouldn't see Joker 2 in theater. I was going to wait until it comes out on streaming. Then... I started reading all of the bad reviews and had to see it in the theater. You messed everything up for me. That said, I will give this movie what I believe is an honest and fair review. I don't understand what half of the 'real' critics are saying, so I wanted to see for myself and write my own. For reference, I gave the first Joker movie a 7/10. Mainly because the Joker was always a guy who robbed banks, killed gangsters, had cool villain toys, a mob of villains, and did bad stuff. This joker is just a real guy with a disease of some sort (he laughs uncontrollably and can't stop it). It didn't have the action and excitement I usually see when Joker comes on set. However, the movie wasn't that bad. In fact, I think it's only getting half of the credit it deserves. 1.7/5 stars. I think it could easily be 3.4/5 stars. This means it's getting sold short by half.

Pros: Cinematography - A (great shots) Acting - A (main actors did a great job. No complaints on the acting) Story - A (It's a good story, but it's just not as exciting and action-packed as Joker movies when he is up against Batman.) Twists/turns - A (There is a sick twist, but it's Joker so you have to expect something like that) Flow - A (runs right in from the first one, and Harley fits right in) Editing - A Unique - A (the prison setting and court settings have been done before but done uniquely, bringing the personality of the Joker into the forefront in front of Arthur Fleck. He was wearing Joker war paint in the courtroom, etc.) Bold - A (going with a musical is bold) Technically, this movie was an A. Everything was on point. I saw no technical errors regarding the camera work, audio, acting, writing, and story. Certainly, nothing that would warrant a 1.7/5 star. A movie getting that low of a score had to have very lackluster performances, which didn't happen here. The writing, storytelling, and technical aspects didn't warrant anything less than 4/5 stars.

Cons: It's a musical - I hate musicals, but it's not so bad in this movie. They use music as a form of therapy while they are in prison so it's not like they are singing for the hell of it.

Not enough action - those who love the action-packed, exciting Joker, well, this movie doesn't have that. It's more psychological, story-driven, and has depth. You'll have to have the patience to sit down and watch it and understand the pain, emotion, and how he thought he was being treated unfairly. It's not about action, but I wish it was The romance - I hate romance movies and usually don't like romantic side stories.

Despite these things, I still couldn't give this movie anything less than 3/5 stars, and I've seen over 1000 movies.

My final score is 3.4 out of 5 stars, or exactly double what critics say. 7.2/10, and that's critical. Some might argue that Margot Robbie did a better job being Harley, but her character is already an all-out psychopathic killer/gun for hire. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn is only a Pyro at best. She hasn't killed anyone yet, not intentionally, anyway. These are two different Harley characters, and obviously, the Harley Quinn with the chainsaw that kills someone every 20 minutes will be more exciting. This one has a deeper/more story/psychological vibe.

Hopefully, this clears up everyone's idea of the movie. It's a good movie. It's way better than everyone is giving it credit for. 1.7/5 stars is way too low. Don't let the reviews stop you from seeing it in the theater. The actors performed well, and there were no technical or creative errors warranting such bad reviews."
8.0,11 October 2024,
8.0,5 October 2024,"Many negative reviews from people that expected the genesis of a villain for yet another Batman cycle, and perhaps with the different angle of ""The villain also has a heart"" which is very popular in nowadays Hollywood.

Instead you got something different and unexpected, but a great film nonetheless, a psychological descent into a conflicted character been pulled by different forces, expectations, desires. A portrait of the abuse of society and a critic of the ""punishment vs rehabilitation"" philosophy of the judicial system. Actors top, music top, scenography and photography top. The end is a masterpiece."
10.0,12 October 2024,"So....

If you're interested or enjoy musicals, if you're up to it, then this movie maybe worth checking out.

This is fully my personal opinion and art, like many forms of art is open to how the audience or viewers feel about it. I personally like this movie. Even without Batman being present, these fictional characters are still entertaining to me. I went into this movie prepared for a musical. I don't think this was marketed well and that maybe part of why there's so much hate towards this movie? Some have even said that this movie is worse than ""Batman & Robin"" and I don't agree with that opinion. There are plenty of other movies that I would put next to or that I feel are slightly worse than ""Batman & Robin"". This film had a lot of interesting points and I felt it tied things together very well with the first movie. This actually feels like a continuation of this Joker narrative. The Joker has no real definitive origin story and that's part of the reason why he's my favorite villain that I love seeing Batman battle against. Joker himself said it best, ""I... I'm not exactly sure what it was. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another.... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice."" (Batman: The Killing Joke)"
10.0,6 October 2024,"For me, this film was a portayal of personal suffering, and may need some life experienve to be appreciated.

Small kindnesses, the lead's incapacity to distinguish healthy individuals from less healthy ones, due to early abuse and his hope to be worthy of love. Human cruelty.

The childhood abuse is written in without it being 'in your face', but the impact of this abuse is crystal clear.

The mental ill health from abuse, the unfairness of the ongoing legacy of this abuse, plus its impact on others (more in the first film) was sad, and I felt the sadness and, at times, hopelessness, emanating from the screen.

Portayal of dissociation and escape into imagined positive worlds to cope, some demonstrated by the dissonant musical interludes which I thoroughly enjoyed.

Quite literally the masking and unmasking, the hope that he is loveable. How 'love' can be conditional on a mask.

The hopefulness and joy of connection was poignant and uplifting in equal measures.

Portrayal of celebrity - how a big masked personality can bring in people who are not interested in the authentic. Fairweather friends.

I rate both leads. I went in with more caution about Lady Gaga's casting, but by the end I conceded I couldn't think of another female lead who would have improved on her performance. Bravo. And Joaquin Phoenix's performance was just phenomenal.

Best film I've seen in a long time. Shed a tear after the film ended, and I very rarely blub."
9.0,7 October 2024,"I loved how the movie predicted in itself the audience reaction, proving once again that no one cares about human being but entertainment. The most complains you read on social media speak about Joker not running eround blowing up building and stuff; this is what everyone expected although the director had said that Artur is not a real Joker. Some call the movie ""woke"" without even being able to point to what exactly was ""woke"" about it, spoilers (nothing) woke is just enother word that people now use to label everything they dont like. Some bleim Gaga like she was the director or writer, she was neither."
10.0,12 October 2024,"Ok. I whent to see this film in imax, and it was amazing. Yes the music was poorly placed(atleast some of it was) it was a lot better than people are saying. The story was great. Acting was on point. Great music. Script was ok I don't get why everyone said it sucks .

It has got a few scenes that have on screen and off screen suicide references though, so if that's kind of an uncomfortable topic for you this film probably isn't the best for you to watch.

On the whole it was great. Even got a standing ovation at the end of it.

This film is great and please go see it. Don't listen to people. If they don't like the movie it doesn't mean u won't."
9.0,6 October 2024,"I think this movie exemplifies how crazy and conceited the Joker is. I don't know why people are expecting some sort of character development. He is a murderer, he's not a hero. That's the point. Lady Gaga was great and I loved that she didn't make Harley Quinn this annoying character like she can be played in other movies. Joaquin Phoenix was great. Lady Gaga was great. It wasn't a musical in typical way and I loved that. The sound design was excellent. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I don't think the bad reviews are accurate. The Jokers movies are not the same as the Marvel-like hero and villain movies. It was creepy, funny, silly, sad and ridiculous. I would highly recommend it."
8.0,6 October 2024,
8.0,11 October 2024,Amazing movie not for everyone. A very deep and heavy movie focuses mainly on the psychological profile of the character Arthur Fleck rather than the villain Joker. Sometimes you cannot distinguish what is reality and what is in Arthur Flexk's fantasy. The performances of both Phoenix and Gaga are stunning authentic and raw. Gaga shines as an actress in that movie. The musical scenes are on spot and they create a dark atmosphere reminding of the old good cinema. It's definitely not like the first movie but still a very good movie. The cinematography is amazing as well as the music. The ending prepares the audience for the real Joker. I was prepared to watch a very bad movie after reading the critics but I was impressed bu the way the music is unwinding. The whole cinema was really happy with the movie and nobody seemed to be unsatisfied. A clear 8/10 for us.
8.0,5 October 2024,
10.0,6 October 2024,"I watched the Joker premiere, and i liked the movie a lot. They shouldn't have put that many songs into it, but i blame the bad casting of Lady Gaga for that. The movie it self did have a good story and follow up story to the first one, it still attacked the social structures in the American system and critised the mental health issues that the modern western world poses. Besides that it had a sublime sarcastic and dark humor with honorable nudges to the Dark Knight trilogy as well as Easter eggs for the hardcore Batman fans. There were even some good questions it asked the audience throughout. So if they kept it to the singing that was inline with the story and Joker character itself, it would have been an amazing movie. Sadly the problem is not the movie but the people who watch it i see. Many people showed a lot of misunderstanding for the movie besides being blatend ignorant to the problems and showings at hand. They do not show emotional and mental understanding and dare i say, maturity, to understand how it is to be mentally ill (actually mentally ill) as well as they do not understand societys lack of grasp around it, and how much they enforce psychotic behavior. The movie isn't bad, the people who didn't like it is. And i can say that, even if it is subjective to the watcher. Because of you can't appreciate it.. you should go back to the education system, because it failed you more than it did the Joker. This movie wasn't made for you to like it or please you. It was made to make you think and realise that you yourself walk with dark thoughts and dark tendencies aswell as how much you as a person neglect compassion and empathy.. which again shows that if you didn't like it, you're just proof of it's message.

The story was fine, and kept well with the feeling and understanding of the first. The artsy things in it, isn't overly done and they make sure to show exactly which components of art they have and why. Lady Gaga is as always a bad and emotion less actor but she did seem to enjoy the role and that made it more likeable. The songs could again have been limited to 2 songs.

Shame on the people who dislike it. Honestly you are not worth a movie."

8.0,14 October 2024,"I cant say it is a masterpiece I enjoyed seeing the film. I want put it in one of my favourites but not on the bad ones I will say it is a sequel of a movie that didnt need one. Like interstellar is a very beautiful movie and many want to see a sequel but doesnt need one will not add something. Exactly that happens in the joker the first one is a movie with a spectacular performance some will say with a scenario follow behind. The joker 2 is something similar very good and enjoyable acting with a mid scenario (nothing fancy). The musical sketch I didnt mind it a nice someone maybe will be bored not me (in laland I got bored at some point dont know why). But the musical will not gonna save and make a 10/10 movie at least not in this one. To summarise good picture and sound the acting it was very good if not perfect. If someone expect to see joker 1 on this one noyou will see something different with a question on the ending so you maybe will hate it or you maybe you will be ok with it.

I am ok with the joker 2 I will not sit down and watch it again but again joker from the beginning (joker 1) doesnt really have much else to give to the story or the character. So yeah maybe the recipe from the start was just a medium. I dont know go watch it to have your opinion."
8.0,9 October 2024,"Some spoilers may arrive but I'll make sure I don't state them so obviously.

Weirdly that is the synopsis of the film.

Is it as good as the first? No.

But it is excellent.

From the off your treated to a reminder of what's happened but also )incase you miss it) what was to come, the whole point of the film.

People seem not to understand who or what Joker is, and Todd Phillips Gaga and Phoenix nail it. Why would you screen test this, there's no way it would get through because your being asked to think and be entertained in so many different ways. Because ultimately you nor anyone ever really understands what the Joker is. We love him as a villain or of a voice for the ignored. But you should never forget he is a psychotic killer, who wishes just to be noticed and loved. At times you do love him, you feel sorry for him, you try to think you can work him out and believe you could fix him.

Arthur doesn't know who the Joker is because the joker is entertainment but not for the purpose of Arthur. Arthur always wanted to be an entertainer and loved, but as Arthur. Arthur cannot play the Joker as an act, Joker is Joker or to the audience the Joker, that's the point. Arthur could never continue, he was never going to get out. So why are we all lambasting this for trying to portray it for what it is. Gaga is excellent, and Lee deceivingly mischievous but always in control. Not so much a puppeteer, remember he studying. She's the only one who gets it and how to remove the demons. A pathological liar but for all the right reasons.

Phoenix is marvelous, you just don't ever understand Arthur. For some I think thats where they are left let down. Either you want to be a part of his story or your patience runs thin, get to the explosions and the gangs and then let's see Batman. Come on guys that's yet to come and has been told numerous times over. There's a long way to go yet. Rome wasn't built in a day neither was Gotham burned so quickly.

Harvey Dent, Phillips teases you so much you might miss it. Not the lighting on his face of the blood splatter. Rember it takes one to know one and it's early in his story too. He studies Arthur or Joker or whoever.

Arthur wants love, Quinn doesn't want Arthur because he can't survive he's pathetic and useless. It's what she knows, thats what she wants. And with it will come mayhem and power and the most incredible patient and patients she'll ever have!

As for the ending(s).

Remember the shadow at the front.

Remember what a metaphor is.

As for the signing and dancing and tap and courthouse acting etc etc remember the Joker is an entertainer.

If you didn't do it already and didn't know, Google the meaning of Foile a Deux

Go and see it. I understand why people don't like it."
10.0,10 October 2024,
10.0,7 October 2024,"Ok so lets preface:

If you don't like musicals - don't watch this.

If you didn't fully get the hidden psychology in Joker 1 - don't watch this.

If bombs, bullets and boobs get your three brain cells twitching - don't watch this.

Ps - it's a musical. It's a musical. It's a musical.

This movie is groundbreaking, intelligent and smashes together genres like no other.

If you have a brain, enjoy musicals and not just enjoyed but ""got"" the first Joker, you will love this.

The use of fantasised musical scenes with graphic violence to illustrate Arthur's mental state is fantastic.

Watch the movie carefully, appreciate the hidden links and depths. The ending, so many people simply didn't get it, look at the other guy around 3 seconds before credits roll, check what he's doing to himself.

Seriously this movie deserves awards but I can see how the thick brainwashed TikTok scrolling masses would not like it."
8.0,9 October 2024,"Everything seemed very logical to me. In the first film, we see a man on the brink of what could be called ""egoistic suicide""* (Durkheim, Suicide: A Study in Sociology). He is under immense stress and unable to cope with the pressure. He begins to respond to stimuli in the simplest way-through aggression* (Erich Fromm, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness). There were no ambitions to become a king or change the system. He was simply acting out of pure rage. Notice how he wasn't even aligned with the protesters; he was just enjoying the attention they gave him.

The second film, then, is a logical progression of the situation. Yes, it takes place in a somewhat exaggeratedly brutal world... but that depends on perspective.

He is lonely, he finds hope in Gaga's recognition, the music plays in his head, and he starts to heal. But then he confronts reality: Gaga and the protesters need the Joker; the lawyer needs a schizophrenic. But no one needs Arthur Fleck, the man who committed crimes consciously, but never truly wanted to."
10.0,9 October 2024,"I write this as someone who is not a diehard comic book fan. If you are someone looking for an amazing adaptation of the original Joker from the comics, and you might not find it here. But you will find an amazing movie nonetheless. If you enjoyed the first movies themes of mental health, exploration and subversion of someone's mind and delusion. If you enjoyed the elements of unreliable narration from Arthur. You will find that and much more in this movie.

The main criticism seen online is the Musical aspect of the movie. I am not a fan of musicals myself as they tend to seem superficial and be all style and no substance. That can be fun and entertaining like popcorn, but if you felt attached to the grittiness and the themes of the Joker I can understand your apprehension to the idea of it becoming a musical. I definitely was. My fears were reassured within the first 20 minutes of the movie and within the first musical number. To be light on spoilers, he finds out information from a local news broadcast and in a moment where the original movie would've had him interpretive dance to a haunting backing track, instead we can a glimpse into the mind of Arthur directly. He hear the music and the chaotic energy lurking beneath his mind. This instantly quelled my fears of the musical ruining the experience for me.

The other main criticism audiences have is the folly of their expectations. If you come into this movie expecting Joker to be transformed and become a version of Jokers prior. You will be disappointed, he is not going to become this mythical villain. He is Arthur fleck and that so happens to contain elements of the Joker. He is not the Joker in the same way Heath Ledger is or Jared Leto. He is Arthur Flecks Joker. Which for me personally I find very compelling as we rarely get a glimpse into the machinations of the person behind the Joker.

To not delve into spoilers I'll leave it with this. If you come in with an open mind, don't expect a cunning supervillain action movie, don't have a disdain for musicals entirely and are not dissatisfied by a unorthodox telling of the Joker without ties to the comics. You will find yourself thoroughly enjoying this movie if you found any appreciation for the first. I can guarantee it."
10.0,6 October 2024,"In the final moments, as Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix embrace - their voices blending in perfect duoloquy...

For those of you complaining? Hello!?! You wouldn't know creativity if Raygun busted a move right upside your heads!

I'm seriously done trying to educate you people. Greatest breakdancer EVER! Greatest musical EVER!

Heck, aside from Megalopolis? I mean - who even knew Plan 9 from Outer Space even NEEDED an origin story?

That, my friends, is the true genius of people like Coppola, Phoenix, Gaga, and last but NEVER least... the incomparable Rachael Gunn.

We are very susceptible to suggestion, but time has a way of redeeming truly interesting artwork once the zeitgeist has washed away.

This movie slaps and the musical format works incredibly well for the themes. Making a musical is always going to piss off a lot of people. Some of the courtroom stuff falls short, but overall it's a really fun and interesting sequel to the first film. My daughter and I loved it. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is as always superb and Lady Gaga does a phenomenal job as well. Adding Brandon Gleeson on top of that was delightful, and there are some interesting new faces in the asylum scenes who I am looking forward to seeing more of.

One criticism is that the person they chose to play the Young Harvey Dent was so bad that it nearly ruined many of the scenes. I want to know who that person's relatives are because they didn't get there by ability alone."

9.0,13 October 2024,"Joker makes his deput in one holocaust of crime against the idea of being a hero than a villain that he is! It's inappropriate way to say ""real"" or ""true"" for the movie. Filmmaking with such scenario is a new idea standards! Cartoon scheens in the start creates a comic experience than we ever seen before. Its a coming of a new age script for movies with new boundaries! Having read DC comic books and graphic novels such as batman and Robin, Joker Endgame,I have never seen the part of Joker himself. This is the movie to see Joker in one of his own psychological,comedy and Crime movies of 1950's now at the cinemas! At last the second movie is a musical romance! Harley queen (Lady gaga) plays her role on this undergoing thrilling movie!"

10.0,4 October 2024,"I watched the original Joker five times when it came out over the span of a month or two. Obviously I couldn't get enough. I don't put a lot of expectations into movies these days. I try to just go in hoping to get a few goosebumps here or there if at all. Joker 2 did do that. It did it toward the end two times. That was unexpected. Joker 2 didn't deliver a carbon copy movie of the first though some of the songs and soundtrack seemed to be the same. It is a movie for people that get something from knowing a director went for it. By that I mean not trying to appease the masses that came in droves to watch the first one. It challenges those that come in thinking they will see Joker be Joker and be triumphant as that, but the movie is about Arthur Fleck. A nobody that one day finds himself a cult hero for the unhappy masses of Gotham. That's no spoiler. That's what happened in the first one. It was poetic. Becoming this thing was almost accidental and we saw that magic grow inside Arthur. We all rooted for him to finally become something even if it meant killing people and destroying his world. We were in that same fantasy state throughout. It was perfect. Then reality hits. That's what Joker 2 I think is about. As that song that is played in the first and second go, ""That's Life"" Joker 2 takes us on a voyage of what happens to those expectations. Almost meta because we have our own expectations going in wanting Joker once again to succeed in his diabolical plan. Yet without spoiling it we find that life is just that. Nothing special. Joker 2 is an excellent film if you see the magic that it is. It is okay to hate it for now, but it will grow on you if you let yourself also grow. That is the power of a good film. One that has the potential for being watched over the years and getting something else each time. I think this is one of those films."
9.0,6 October 2024,"I love musical, jazz, Lady Gaga, and the first Joker movie. When I saw the trailer I knew it would remind me of Chicago: a nobody who rises to fame because of a murder they commited, and having to go through a trial and ""razzle dazzle"" attention from the media and society... eventually realizing that everything is only for the sake of ""entertainment"".

The movie was exactly like what I hoped it to be. I absolutely loved it, the acting was brilliant, the cinematography was as beautiful as the first movie. Watching it on IMAX was definitely a feast for the eyes.

I can see why a lot of people are complaining. Ironically, or should I say interestingly, they are just like the Joker's supporters in the movie. They're only here to see ""the Joker"", the violent man we all expect him to be. But they all leave the theater once they find out that he's just... Arthur. A sad, depressed, troubled humanbeing living in a real world. For me personally, it's a good thing because it stays true to the first movie. They're not trying to magically turn him into a high-class mafia in one night.

Joker Folie à Deux is hands down the most realistic and controversial take on an antihero franchise. It may get a lot of hate now, but that's just because it is way ahead of its time. It will be a pioneer of a new experimental genre, sparks never-ending discussions, and surely will be a cult film in the upcoming decades. Just like Chicago when it won an Oscar."
8.0,7 October 2024,"In the same way that Arthur, at the end, couldn't play the role others wanted him to play, which made everyone very mad and disappointed in him, this movie wasn't what most people wanted it to be. It was a real movie about a very real and very broken man who, sadly, couldn't possibly get a happy ending. This is the most realistic portrayal and ending for the joker. People want to see him as a crazy martyr, a leader of the oppressed, the spark of the revolution, a clown that just go around doing crazy stuff and not giving a damn anymore, Batman's enemy, but what they got was a hurt man trying to escape his horrible reality with a fantasy, feeding up on all his pseudo glory for a while before realizing he couldn't handle it. That he didn't want to play the role of the clown anymore. Both Gaga's and Phoenix's acting are magical. They really gave everything they had for the roles and they did it masterfully. Everyone is complaining about the musical part but I think it fitted perfectly with Arthur's escapism. Also the direction and photography of this movie are gorgeous. I am not a Batman fan and maybe this is why I didn't mind such a different portrayal of the joker when compared to the comics or Batman's movies. But I really think this is the most human and real joker they could have created. My advice is don't listen to the criticism, go watch it and have your own opinion about it and try not to expect a cartoonish caricature of the joker, because that's not what you are going to get."
10.0,13 October 2024,"It's always admirable when a filmmaker makes a film that defies expectations. And defy expectations Joker 2 does. Influenced by films like Leos Carax's Annette (which was also a major influence behind Megalopolis) or Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, Joker takes the learning that the musical genre contains in its core the seeds of lunacy and uses it to dive deep into the Joker's psychology.

When Joker 1 came along, it surprised everyone by not even mentioning Batman. Joker 2 pushes the envelope even further, basically staying away from the very Joker character for the entire film. The result is strange, disorienting and many viewers will come out feeling like they were shortchanged. But it's oh so refreshing to see a movie that chooses not to look like a ""full-in-the-blanks"" form!

Does it all work perfectly? No, and that's why it's rated 8 vs 10. The trial feels long. The joker scenes, albeit imaginary, work okay not great.

But ultimately that's not the issue with Joker 2, which is a good enough movie, maybe one of the best of the year to come out of a studio. The problem, for once, is financial. There is no reason this movie should have cost $200M to make. Anyone reading the script should have known this would not appeal to mass audiences. At a $40 or $50M budget, this would have been an example of how artistic movies targeting adults can be very profitable, and would have encouraged more. Instead, it will go down in history as a massive flop and a financial disaster and will discourage studios from taking similar risks in the future. This is Todd Phillips' responsibility, and one can both appreciate the movie and lament the damage done to filmmaking in general."
8.0,13 October 2024,"I understand that it's not what most people expected to see but how someone can say it's a bad movie..

For sure it's not a typical joker movie with elements of actions and violence that someone would believe it will have but it shows us from a realistic , charming and bold perspective what happened to the mental ill Arthur Fleck after the murders that he committed.

I liked the dark atmosphere of the film, I love Joaquin Phoenix he is a really brilliant actor and the music parts of the film fit in really well. Lady gaga was ok for her part..

I believe that it will be one of the films whose value is recognized years later."
8.0,9 October 2024,"I was captivated by Lady Gaga's portrayal of Lee Harlequin and it was sad at the end. Joaquin's performance of Arthur Fleck Joker was psychologically complex and moving. The multiple layers unravel firstly a sense of helplessness in Arkham Asylum and his social environment with the prison guards. Then hope from his relationship with Lee deepens but understands with love comes lies. The pacing of the film is good it moves easily thru the scenes and never skips a beat. The singing musical aspect didn't take away any of the film for me. I thought it was relevant for the Joker's and Harlequin's relationship also mental state and the scene imagination of his and Harlequin's tv show gives an indication or prediction of the final ending. I don't know what all the negative opinions are about being directed to this film. The performances of Joaquin and Gaga acting / singing, choreography ( esp Joker tap dancing) and cinematography was amazing. Todd Phillips and his production team created a real work of art!"

8.0,9 October 2024,"There are way to much innecesary movies made nowadays. Specially franchise spinoffs; prequels, sequels, remakes, multiverses... but not this one.

This is hands down one of the best sequels I have ever seen.

It is pretty concerning that movies like this or Furiosa are being box office failures, but DeadPool vs Lobezno is being sucesful.

If this movie came out 20 years ago when people was able to actually pay attention to a movie it would have been labeled as a masterpiece, but nowadays audience struggles watching something that's not a TikTok video.

A complete re-definition of the first movie that, while mantaining the tone and themes, explores complete different genres and adds new perspectives. All a sequel should be.

A superb production where all departments have been absolutetly brilliant.







-Production design at its peak, with ultra realistic life like scenarios, and imaginary musicals.

-Sound design, music and mixing, all elevating the job of the other departments to the max, with a combination of brilliant original music with other songs, a terrific atmosphere construction and life like dialog recording.

I am rewatching 100%. If you can, go to a Dolby Cinema, the Dolby Vision grading must be a life changing experience."
10.0,4 October 2024,If you are a fan of great movies then this fits bill. If you are looking for a comic joker redemption and happy ending then this is not it. Reminds me more of a one who flew over the cookoossnest than comic movie. The realism of a sad mentally ill person who craves love and stardom with a psychotic way to achieve that and an enabling sycophant who encourages it. Anyway the progressive detail of a person who wants to die his hole life and comes to the realization of how to achieve it crossed with blind love is amazing. The acting is incredible the cinematic shots are fantastic. The story is sad and people are mad because it's not the story they would have written but we didn't write it. Anyway I loved it.
9.0,11 October 2024,"Ah, I see I have your attention giving this movie 9 stars. I loved it, except I did think toward the end ""please, no more singing."" But, not because it was a musical (it wasn't, read on). But because I just didn't want to hear anymore singing. But the singing is relevant to this movie, but it's not a musical. And this is why I say that: Music infiltrates every crevice of our lives. We hear music wherever we go and if there is no music playing around us we hear it in our head. When we're in a particular situation we can think of a song related to that or we make up a little song. Some music is prevalent in our lives. So for Joker movie 2 to be a musical makes sense. This is not THE joker (all Capitals), this is a joker. THE joker, the original joker, did not have a name and he was a sociopath. He was disfigured and he got a little angry about that so he took it out on the world. Arthur Fleck is kind of like a parallel universe Joker. He is not the funny and silly joker from the 60s or the excited and psychotic joker from the 70s, etc. This is a different person. This is A joker. And he is not psychotic: he is insane. That's the keyword here: insanity. But even people who are insane still have music in them so it is believable to see someone who is literally insane equating music to different events in their life. That is acceptable, and if you're not accepting that in this movie then you're missing the point. Plus they gave you a big clue in the name of the movie. Those of us who were excited to see this different version of ""Not the joker"" that I grew up with, took the time to translate what the title is (because I don't know French). And it means madness for two and madness is another name for insanity. These people are insane and if you're trying to fit them into a mould, of the joker that you knew in the past or your own understanding of DC comics, it's not gonna work. Maybe you just need to understand insanity a little bit to be able to get this movie. Life is a musical and we should all be able to see this movie like that through Arthur Fleck's eyes."
9.0,13 October 2024,"Do not expect the first film. Do not expect Suicide Squad. This is not a typical comic book film with crazy Joker that is going to kill even more people and escape in the end with as crazy as him Harley Quinn, this is more than that. This is down to earth story of the Joker. Perceive him as a real person in a real world where laws work. This film is art! Every frame, every detail in it, combination of colours, makeup and costumes, lighting, camera angles and movements, shot sizes are well elaborate. The combination of psychological thriller genre with musical is somewhat risky, experimental. However, result came out as unique and brilliant. I haven't seen any film with this crazy but genial idea, and that's why I loved it! Do not have any expectations before watching, do not prepare yourself to anything but just watch it. Music, performance of the actors are on top. Joaquin and Lady Gaga have a great chemistry in this film. Both complemented each other. Despite that this is a dark story, there are moments you will at least smile on or even laugh at. In general, I would say that this film is a descent continuation and finality of Joker in this specific universe. Film deserves attention, it definitely is over hated for no reason and underrated. I'd say it is a must watch to make your own conclusion and do some thinking instead of giving ""coach critics"" the power to effect you!"

9.0,6 October 2024,"Phoenix once again shows a very sad version of the Joker. Just like the first movie - this movie reflects on how horrible we treat people.

I know that he is a criminal - a murder - but the treatment he receives in the mental facility reminds me of the movies I've watched about the Holocaust.

No one should be treated like that! He is abused 24/7 in ways that no human being should be treated.

I felt so sorry for Arthur. The whole movie was about his hardships - everyone using and abusing him - even Harley. Which is actually very true to life. When you are down - people will make sure they shove your face into the dirt.

This movie is not going to do as well as the first one. There were not many people in the theater when I went to see it. It is not light. It is not the usual defiant Joker that we are used to seeing on the screen.

This movie is a reality check - what Joker would be if he really did exist in our world - an adopted boy who spent most of his childhood being abused and mistreated - growing up into an mentally disturbed adult. He creates the Joker world for himself to escape this horrible world that constantly abuses him.

I was shaken by this movie - it was mind-blowing. The singing just seemed to make Arthur seem even more pathetic.

The Joker and Harley world has always interested me. I dedicated my first humor book to them - ""Joker and Harley Poetry"" - as a tribute to their twisted romance.

This movie may not appeal to many because of its portrayal of Joker - but it doesn't mean that it wasn't excellent. I gave the first movie a 10 because it was original. Never have I seen Joker in such a realistic manner. This 2nd movie was a continuation of his tragic story."
10.0,6 October 2024,"When you break the audience's expectations, you create a love-it-or-hate-it movie. The movie, while building a character (Lee), deconstructs the main character (Joker). The musical scenes are true dialogues, delirious ones that happen only in Arthur's head, because in the end this movie is about him, and not the Joker, no matter how much Lee tries to bring him in at various moments. Just as the Joker was born, he died, and we're not talking physically. The ending of the movie is surprising, which takes the viewer out of their comfort zone, and if you pay attention in the final seconds, a surprising connection occurs. Some won't like it, others will, and I'm in the second group."
9.0,20 October 2024,"Despite the first movie being a non-musical, I think this one shifts to the song-and-dance world well. Said scenes retain a level of grit that match the tone of the first movie (as opposed to being all-out Broadway glitz, which would have been too much of a tonal shift). Joaquin Phoenix surprised me with his ability to both sing and dance well, and of course Lady Gaga was brilliant. As for Gaga's character of Harleen ""Lee"" Quinzel, I found her incorporation to not only be an appropriate match for Phoenix but also a unique one. Both Lee and Phoenix's Arthur Fleck disturb and pull at the heart strings while having intense chemistry. There are genuinely funny and heartbreaking moments throughout the movie as well that kept me emotionally engaged.

If you dislike musicals and/or are looking for a movie that resembles Batman: The Animated Series, this movie is probably not for you. But if you want to dive deeper into the depths of the mind of Joker's sympathetic and insane antihero and don't mind song and dance, ignore the bad reviews and give this movie a watch!"
10.0,10 October 2024,"Seeing a lot of negative reviews, which I really don't get.

Let's get this straight, no one wants a rehash of the first movie, this is a continued story with the outcome of the previous movie, we now see Arthur Fleck behind bars and going on trial for his murders from the previous movie.

Let's get the musical element out of the way - I thought it was really good and in tune with the theme of the movie Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) meeting Arthur like a moment in Romeo & Juliet, total chemistry and the perfect duo, it was artistic and fitting of their desired fantasy living in a world that revolves around them.

I thought the cast was brilliant, Joaquin Phoenix once again putting in a top performance, gritty New York as the backdrop was great again and I like the fact the story continued from behind bars, first movie was about self discovery for Arthur, this time it's a case study and a court room drama."

10.0,11 October 2024,"In my opinion the first movie was to showcase Arthur's decent into madness, this movie expands upon that. The musical numbers highlight this in 2 ways. On the tonal shift from the start of some songs being off key voices with little instrumentals to a dark shift in the instrumental giving way to cleaner vocals, larger theatrics, and more accompaniments I believe shows the maddens or that the joker taking over Arthur's psyche. The second way I feel it adds is it continues to play on the unreliable narrator, is he actually singing and dancing or is it all in his head. I think the movie also poses the interesting ethical question, can someone truly be in such a broken state of mind that they are not fully responsible for their actions, and is it a failure of the state for cutting social programs that lead to his decent. Overall I left the theater confused why there were so many negative reviews as I throughly enjoyed it and will likely continue mulling it over until I'm able to watch it again. I think if you go into it expecting to be taking on a journey into the mind of a broken man you will enjoy it a lot more, which is the same mindset I went into the first one with."
8.0,11 October 2024,"A film, like any work of art, isn't meant to meet our expectations, but rather to challenge them. Many anticipated Joker: Folie à Deux to mirror the first film, but its divergence from that narrative is precisely what gives it depth. This sequel doesn't just focus on the Joker as the chaotic villain; it shifts the lens to Arthur, the man behind the mask. Arthur is a person desperately seeking love, recognition, and validation-a man whose life has been shaped by his mother's neglect and emotional mismanagement. His relationship with 'Gaga' represents his first taste of feeling truly seen, and through this connection, the film delves into his struggle to express himself.

The musical numbers, rather than being random, are a window into Arthur's inner world. They serve as his unspoken emotions, giving voice to feelings he can't express in words. In these moments, we witness how Arthur escapes his reality by retreating into the songs in his head, making the film's musical turn a clever narrative device for those open to free-spirited expression.

This isn't a story of good versus evil, but rather a reflection on how society's cruelty can warp a person's psyche. It shows how we can sometimes romanticize the twisted sides of people, while overlooking the more fragile and human aspects. At its core, Folie à Deux reveals the way cruelty can push people into a never-ending loop of psychological pain, when all it might take is a bit of kindness to break that cycle. If you let the film resonate with you, it becomes a poignant commentary on human frailty and society's role in nurturing or destroying it."
9.0,18 October 2024,
8.0,8 October 2024,"Arthur is not THE Joker. He's not intelligent, he's not a criminal genius, he's just a mentally ill loser. Nothing more. He's an insignificant nobody. That was already clearly shown in part 1, but many viewers didn't get it and got it right in the face in this film who Arthur is. A loser. A nobody.

The director knew what people would hate about the film. When they were dancing the audience got quiet and said Lee let's give them what they want and a violent scene was shown. Just as he says at the end that she should please stop singing. He asks because the director knew that the audience didn't want that either. The film plays with the audience's expectations."
9.0,10 October 2024,"Review of Joker: A Clash Between Fantasy and Reality

If you're expecting chaotic action, car chases, and Joker's iconic laughter, you'll leave disappointed. This Joker isn't about sensory overload; it's an allegory, an emotional reflection of sorrow, akin to the hidden pain in Busby Berkeley musicals. While critics missed its dramaturgical brilliance, this film should be seen through a Kafkaesque lens. Trapped in tragedy, Joker is already dead. A tug-of-war unfolds, between the fantasy of an avenging Joker and the brutal reality Phillips and Phoenix force upon us. Joker's fall into humanity is his betrayal, stripping away the fantasy everyone clung to."
9.0,8 October 2024,"I loved the first Joker and felt it was such a pure cinematic experience so naturally I was excited to see this.

Good lord, this was painful. Not only painful but beyond cringe inducing. Reminded me of a bad unfunny SNL skit but worse. Lady Gaga looked like she wished she was anyone but on that set. The whole vibe reeked of embarrassment. I love me a good campy bad movie however this was not even close. It just was so boring and dull.

For example Glitter was a hoot yet Swept Away was just a snore.

The musical numbers kept going on and on and none of them made you feel anything except sheer boredom.

Avoid this movie and go see The Wild Robot instead."
8.0,11 October 2024,"Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold, unexpected sequel that takes significant creative risks, stepping away from the structure of the first film. Instead of merely continuing the revolutionary energy that some might have anticipated, it chooses to deconstruct the very mythos of its predecessor.

The film pivots from the chaotic, gritty narrative of the first Joker and shifts into a surreal, almost self-reflective portrayal of the character's evolution. At its core, Folie à Deux explores the identity of the Joker as something that constantly reinvents itself. The choice to embrace a musical format adds a layer of irony and nostalgia, reflecting an era of innocence and naivety, much like the Joker we might remember from earlier portrayals. The musical elements are not just stylistic flourishes but serve as a commentary on the Joker's transformation-juxtaposing the dark themes with a sense of playful absurdity, reminiscent of older, more innocent times.

However, this innocence does not survive the movie's trajectory. The film carefully dissects the Joker's character, showcasing the tension between the chaotic and the tragic aspects of his identity. Rather than glorifying rebellion, it reveals the futility of the anarchic figure in today's spectacle-driven society. The film seems to say that the ""revolutionary"" Joker, who became a cultural icon after the success of the first film, has been chewed up and spat out by the same system that made him famous, leaving only a more terrifying, unhinged figure in his place.

Folie à Deux masterfully combines moments of surreal beauty and unsettling psychological depth. It resists being a simple continuation of the first film's success. Instead, it dares to question the very nature of its protagonist and the role of art in our modern world. Some might feel betrayed by the lack of a clear revolutionary narrative, but that is precisely the point. This isn't a film about sparking an uprising-it's about holding up a mirror to the audience and reflecting the chaotic void we often find ourselves in, both as spectators and participants in the modern spectacle of life.

By the end, the film leaves viewers with an unsettling sense of finality, not just for the character but for the innocence of what the Joker once represented. It's a film that challenges expectations, deconstructs its own narrative, and ultimately redefines the character in a way that will provoke deep reflection long after the credits roll."
9.0,6 October 2024,"The new Joker film, which powerfully combines Joaquin Phoenix's raw portrayal with Lady Gaga's nuanced performance, is not only a deep exploration of human vulnerability but also a profound commentary on the brutal consequences of neglect, mental health stigma, and abuse. This film takes audiences on a heart-wrenching journey, revealing the Joker as someone desperately seeking love and acceptance, only to be repeatedly beaten down by society's cruelty.

A key theme is how singing becomes his only refuge, his one means of expressing his inner turmoil. Through music, he connects with Harley Quinn, Lady Gaga's character, and it's the rare form of communication that brings him any sense of relief. Singing is their language, offering brief moments of hope and humanity in a world that continues to crush him. Yet even this relief is fleeting, as his vulnerability is repeatedly exploited, and he is treated like a joke-rewarded only when he performs for others, as though he's less than human.

The film boldly critiques how society treats the mentally ill, showing how those in positions of vulnerability can be manipulated and humiliated. At one point, Joker is degraded to the role of a clown, literally and metaphorically, where he's expected to make others laugh, his pain trivialized and his struggles ignored. The way people exploit his desire for connection and mock his suffering is both shocking and disgusting-yet it's heartbreakingly real. While the film is fictional, it touches on issues that mirror the real world, where vulnerable individuals are often pushed to their limits by cruelty and indifference.

This film is a stark reminder of the consequences of neglecting mental health and treating those in pain as entertainment. It's a devastatingly sad tale of a man who was once kind and caring, but who is ultimately destroyed by the relentless abuse and exploitation he endures. Joker's descent into madness feels inevitable after years of being torn apart by those around him. Society didn't just fail him-it turned him into the monster they feared, only to punish him for it.

This portrayal of Joker is absolutely genius in its layered storytelling, exposing how unchecked cruelty and a lack of compassion can transform even the most vulnerable into something unrecognizable. It's a dark reflection of the world we live in, where people can be pushed too far, and it leaves you questioning how many real-life tragedies could be prevented with just a little more empathy."
8.0,5 October 2024,"Thematically, it was brilliant. Aesthetically, it was gorgeous. It was a dazzling display of lights, that encapsulated the demented imaginative psyche of Arthur Fleck.

Now. --generally in films, I'm usually not a fan of attempts at sympathy to an irredeemable protagonist. Here it works PERFECTLY in this film. Because not only, do we get this , concentrated form of the layered onion that is Arthur fleck unpeeled, we get to learn more about what'd built him up to his present self on trial for murder. He was sexually assaulted, ignored at every turn, demoralized and lied to. He felt so naked... vulnerable and practically violated in the court room scenes.

And the love, or, primary theme of this story.. wow. It worked on every level, and made every Arthur Fleck visual fantasy all the more floaty, for lack of better terms. I found myself grinning at every choreographed dance scene, and upset at every hint at Harley wanting him for attention and chaos, opposed to love.

They had a tug and pull, and it became the primary dilemma for Arthur's character. Really made you FEEL for him. And you shouldn't right?

And this, plea of insanity driving the verdict, felt like such a correct plot device as a means to split Arthur's ethics and identity with 'the joker'. Driving the question, an extension of Arthur fleck? Or a personality made to protect fleck from the abuse.

All this together, made the film excellent. With stellar themes, and things to SAY.

Kept the essence of the original, whilst spinning a new story with an entirely new medium. People'll come to love this movie."

5.14,6 October 2024,"Everyone says how bad this film is due to it being a ""musical"" it's not even that bad, this film captures Arthur fleck beautifully. As for the musical part it's a few maybe 8-10 songs that are 1 minute even most less then a minute long and people cry over it as if its that bad but it is really not that bad whatsoever not even close matter of fact if you cant deal with 10 minutes of singing then I wouldn't recommend any movies lol. The last hour of the movie is beautiful It's a work of art,I really think that the producers did their thing switching up the genre. Also may I add 10/10 acting from Joaquin Phoenix here."
5.14,6 October 2024,
5.14,13 October 2024,"Joker: Folie À Deux is brilliant precisely because it did not give the people what they wanted. Instead of being a movie about an evil genius, it is a film about the mundanity of life. Serial killers eventually get caught and, despite their best efforts, they never break out of prison. They rant, rave, fantasise, write books and give interviews to the media, thinking that they are so smart and have great plans, but eventually they die in prison, either from old age or killed by a fellow inmate.

This film is also about the morbid obsession society has with people like Richard Ramirez, Charles Manson, et al., personified in this film by the character of Harley Quinn (played by Lady Gaga). Podcasters, authors, lonely pen pals and people who just want to see the world burn view these characters as anti-heroes, but in the end, these killers are not heroes. They are murderers who have accomplished little in life, often have low IQs, leave devastated families in their wake, and rarely show remorse. These killers find it hard to understand the pain they cause to others because they live in a complete fantasy world, as does Joker in this film.

This sequel exposes Joker as being just a delusional and common criminal. The audience keeps expecting great acts of revenge or great acts of romance, but Joker never accomplishes anything great. He is a loser stuck in both a physical and mental prison. Violence and romance only take place in his head but, in real life, he gets beaten, abused and condemned by the system. Viewers expect a cartoonish victory by a cartoonish character, but instead they get a Joker far removed from the comic book pages he was born in.

This film is sad and hard to watch, but, unlike dross trying to be funny with cartoonish violence like Deadpool vs. Wolverine, it is grown up. Although Joker 2 will likely never be loved by the masses, appreciation for it will probably grow among audiences who are into studying characters' mental state rather than sitting there waiting for the next fight scene or for something to go boom.

In its character study, in being perhaps the first downer musical, and in completely failing to give the people what they want, this film is shocking, bold and incredibly frustrating, but it is all the better for it. Instead of the anti-hero we craved, we got a mirror to our society and the dead-end loser we deserve. This is not a comic book. This is real life. Weep for it."
5.14,6 October 2024,"After watching and loving the first Joker film I was keen to see the sequel in spite of some poor reviews.

Although the story line is a continuation the film style is certainly different from the first one in a lot of ways and to be honest I found that refreshing. So many sequels are filmed in repetitive ways and the storylines are predictable ( which I suppose gives some film goers comfort) whereas Folie a Deux takes you out of your comfort zone and gives you a completely new experience Joaquin Phoenix and. Lady Gaga are brilliantly insane together and play their roles of two people united by hiding behind a fantasy facade that takes them away from the reality of their real lives.

Throughout the film both Gaga & Phoenix break into song ( and dance) routines that express their emotions and highlight their craving for the love and attention that they both crave but has sadly eluded them.

I get that some critics were left uncomfortable with the amount of singing in the movie but to me it perfectly emphasised the sad and crazy personalities of the two main characters.

A great film

I think a lot of people hate this movie because it does the complete opposite of what the first film did. It doesn't give people what they want a classic Joker story. What the movie is trying to say is that the world doesn't care about mental health; it cares about spectacle and being entertained. That's part of the reason Arthur became the Joker. This movie shows us that people only care about the Joker, not Arthur Fleck. People just want to see the Joker being a murderous psychopath, terrorizing Gotham, rather than seeing him heal, recover, and go back to who he was.

In my eyes, this movie suggests that the Joker is a personality created by a broken system that doesn't care about mental health. Harley Quinn's character symbolizes us, the audience, and how someone's mental health shouldn't come at the expense of our entertainment. Harley only loves Arthur because he's the Joker, which further drives home that point.

Now, on to the reason why I actually love this movie so much: the cinematography was outstanding; so many of the shots were beautiful and artistic. I loved the musical elements of this film. All the songs were great, and they made me want to get out of my seat and start dancing. I loved the courtroom scenes; they were gripping and engaging.

That said, I can see that there are indeed a lot of flaws in this movie. One issue was the relationship between the Joker and Harley Quinn it felt shallow, at times even stupid, and didn't seem to work well. Another problem was how underutilized Lady Gaga was as Harley Quinn. She could've had a much bigger impact in the movie, but overall, her character was poorly written.

Lastly, I feel like Todd Phillips made this movie a musical because he hated the incel fans of the first film. I actually enjoyed the ending, as it reinforced the idea that the Joker is more of a personality created by a broken system than a person we should look up to. I absolutely adored this movie and think everyone should give it a chance. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but I loved it."

Some people want to see the same super hero/vilan film all the time, the same avenger style as always, only action movies, etc... I bet many people won't watch or will talk badly about this movie ONLY because its a musical.

About the film then. I heard many critisim wannig to kwon what the story is about. The movie is about a realistic Joker. It's about mental heath issues, abuse and violence. Its also a critisim about the judicial and prisional sistem of America and civilization in genaral.

Its a slow story, because the joker is in trial and being a ""realistic"" movie, he will not blow up jail and run. I think the alternative to make the movie more dinamic and to show more of the over the top and lunatic joker that we kwnow, was to make it a musical. I think it was a great idea and it was perfectly done.

The performances, specially joaquin phoenix, were exceptional. The frames look incredible and the musics are beautiful. I specially love how the ""musical parts"" start getting more and more frequent and over the top as joker is getting more and more mad. He's of course allucinatining with harley.

In the end I love the movie. My only critisim is about the durating. For a movie with a slow storyline and a different style 2h18h it's too long. Sometimes even good musics became a bit massive because we are already tired.

Said that, Joker 2 Its not better then the first one, but its a very good movie that deserve the recognition of a work well done."
5.14,9 October 2024,"People who rated this movie low clearly didn't understand the movie. They expected a cliche movie.

It shows how society creates a villain and how it kills the same person if they resist to become a villain.

On the other hand when the guy cuts his own face, the story continues in the audience mind that maybe Batman is fighting the fake joker to take the revenge of his own brother, the real joker, who was the victim of everyone around him. His mother, his father, his government that cut his treatment found, his lover, and his fans.

The name of the movie is larger than the frame because this character is huge and won't fit in the frame."
5.14,13 October 2024,"The first Joker was lightning in a bottle, a damn-near perfect standalone experience that left many questions unanswered, something that worked in that film's favour quite wonderfully.

So did Joker 'need' a sequel? No. Yet here we are...

Despite my preference for the tale of Arthur Fleck/Joker (?) to remain shrouded in mystery, I have to admit that Folie à Deux has wormed its way into my mind and my appreciation for it has deepened since leaving the cinema.

I for one applaud the bold creative choices made by Phillips and co. From the Looney Tunes-esque animated intro to the musical numbers peppered throughout that range from understated and solemn to loud and exuberant, it's safe to say that this isn't what people were expecting to see.

The decision to flip these characters on their heads has proved to be understandably controversial. But it's all in line with the ideas and themes the filmmakers set out to explore: the veneration and worship not of the individual but the figure and what they represent, the fascination with high-profile killers granted celebrity status by the media and the masses.

The acting is top-notch as expected, Phoenix's Joker and Gaga's understated Harley in particular shine in every scene. The film looks fantastic with dynamic camerawork and cinematography. Hildur Guðnadóttir also returns with another appropriately sombre and chilling score

Those expecting the Joker & Harley show however will be left wanting.

My initial reaction walking out of Folie à Deux was one of uncertainty and coldness whereas Joker left me feeling emotionally drained in the best way possible. That being said the film has honestly stuck with me, and the more I think about it the more I appreciate the filmmaking on display.

It may not be as tight, poignant or disturbing as the first film and the question surrounding the necessity of a sequel will linger for some time. But I respect it nonetheless and in time, I believe, it will earn the respect it deserves."
5.14,10 October 2024,"I think it is important to see this film for what it is not what you wanted it to be. Todd Phillips is playing with our own (his audiences) madness, and let's face it, we are undoubtedly mad. He is has obviously achieved this successfully and this is made abundantly clear when I read the wording in some of the other reviews here on iMDB. In the first film he introduced us to a character and played with our psyche to the point that we wanted him to kill people, we wanted him to kill the bullies on the train, we felt he was justified to do so. It was all leading up to him appearing on the night show where again, we felt OK and excited about him shooting the host dead. In our own fantasies, by watching a film, should we want people to be murdered just because the world is rigged? We, the audience are essentially the raging crowd at the end of the first film admiring a madman who is helping us get revenge on all thats wrong with the world. The second film, without giving too much away, hints at what the masses, in the real world (if it is indeed real) and the masses in the film that want Arthur set free into the world to start a movement. We, the people watching the film are essentially the people outside the courthouse, though we get to watch it all unfold to our disliking. And that is the point, he wants to spit in our face, that is the true art of this film and in my opinion he has successfully and artfully achieved that feat..."
5.14,3 October 2024,"What can I say, the true shared madness is the one between the director and the screenwriter: a sequel so antithetical to the prequel, that it subverts the premises and takes an anarchic approach to delivering a metacinematic reflection as powerful as it is clumsy and superficial, I would have never imagined it.

The musical inserts are unbearable, and the commercial flop seems almost inevitable (the Joker fanbase will feel betrayed - just look at the first IMDb ratings), but it will be remembered as a remarkable case of self-sabotage for a potential blockbuster that risked everything, with no regard for audience expectations or the box office.

Todd Phillips could have taken the easy path paved by the 2019 Joker, culminating in an escalating frenzy of shared violence, satisfying the sadistic viewers who, five years ago, reveled in watching the transformation of an anonymous outcast into DC's most charismatic supervillain.

Instead, this Joker will go down in the history of cinema for diametrically opposite reasons, leaving theaters empty."
5.14,21 October 2024,
5.14,6 October 2024,"The cast is brilliant. There is chemistry throughout, even in the supporting performances.

The production value has been outragely raised, but we see not that much more of Gotham City in the 1980s.

Cinematography, production design and music are all Hollywood top notch. But the editorial lingers too long in cell, corridors and backyards which technically could save the picture 15min in running time.

The first thing I heard in an half-full IMAX auditorium by just a guy with his girlfriend seating in my route ""What a let down"".

I think two or three dialogues should have been in place without singing due to the script by Silver/Phillips. The Harley/Joker stage show scene would have had more impact.

My conclusion, there are huge opportunities lost because of the sheer anticipation by the mass movie audience.

07/10."
5.14,7 October 2024,"Well look what happens when Todd Phillips doesn't directly rip off a movie and creates something on his own.

I hope this exposes him for the hack that he is and all of you realize just how bad the first movie really was.

Phillips doesn't actually have anything to say and these jokers movies were only created so he could ""turn the superhero genre on it's head."" He thinks he's capable of much more talent and didn't create these movies for any other reason than to be a contrarian. And that's not how real art or good art is made.

This was obvious when this ""anti superhero movie"" not only set itself up for a sequel but then made one. And a musical? You know the thinking was, ""What's the last thing that anyone would do in a superhero movie?"" Phillips sucks."
5.14,5 October 2024,"Horrible? No. Cinematic trainwreck? Far from it! Disappointing? Absolutely.

There was no chance this would live up to the first ""Joker,"" even though, like previously, I went in with unreasonably high expectations, despite the reviews out of Venice being mixed-to-negative. I honestly wanted to ignore them since the first ""Joker"" wasn't as well-received either, at least by critics. I saw that film a few months back, and it was fantastic! It came across as a movie dedicated to developing the Joker beyond what the Batman movies beforehand showed him off as, making for a tragic and shocking watch. Was a sequel to the first ""Joker"" necessary? Not really, since there was nowhere to take the story that would feel natural - and it shows.

It's not as bad as people say it is, but it is hard to ignore the flaws and appreciate the positives, and they were a lot for me.

First, even if this film failed, the aspects that could not possibly fail were the performances and all the actors delivered. Despite his character taking a unique direction I'll discuss in a second, Joaquin Phoenix does outstanding work as Arthur Fleck / The Joker. He feels more constrained since he is in custody for his actions in the first film, but Phoenix makes his character believable. Lady Gaga does a great job as Lee Quinzel or Harley Quinn, although she is never called that. Weird.

Before talking about another positive, they marketed this as a musical. It works to an extent, with two phenomenal musical sequences, but it's easy to remove them entirely. They weren't original, as they licensed songs for the characters to cover, which makes me wonder if they spent most of the $200M budget on songs. Also, how did this film cost $200M? We'll get to the directing in a second, but how the film was shot and structured could have easily been made on a $100M budget, not a $200M budget. John Wick: Chapter 4 cost $100M, and it looks fantastic, has mind-blowing action, and feels like a film they spent more money on. It should have happened with ""Joker: Folie à Deux."" If projections are anything to go by, we are looking at a potential box-office bomb!

Okay, now the directing. Todd Phillips delivered, especially when it came to the music sequences. There are many interesting shots that I would call remarkable, on top of moments that land outside of the sequences. Additionally, Hildur Guðnadóttir's score was excellent, which made the scenes more emotional and extravagant than they have any right to be.

I also appreciated the film focusing on the Trial of the Joker rather than the Joker wreaking havoc. It's not as good as what Joker did in the first, but it was compelling, for the most part. That, however, leans into my first negative. The film's focus on the trial leads to scenes dragging and not engaging. The unnecessary musical numbers feel like they were supposed to keep the movie's pacing from feeling boring. I'm glad I don't have to title this review ""Joker: Folie à Deuzzzzzz.""

I might as well talk about the rest of the negatives. There were many unnecessary scenes outside the music, or they felt inessential and threatened to drag down the movie's momentum.

I didn't entirely appreciate Joker or Lee Quinzel's portrayals in this film. Given the circumstances, Joker at least feels consistent, but I must say that Quinzel wasn't that captivating. For the most part, she was extraordinary, and I felt her connection with the Joker. Unfortunately, once the ending happened, I ceased to care about her character, which is a huge problem since they advertised this as her movie alongside the Joker.

Also, can we talk about that ending? It's teetering on bad and brings the entire experience down. I liked this movie up until that ending, but it was such a letdown that I more or less respect the film more than I like it.

In closing, ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" is almost guaranteed to disappoint. It's in the running for the most disappointing film of the year alongside ""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""I Saw the TV Glow."" It's an incredibly ambitious movie, but those ambitions make it sound incredibly out-of-tune.

Technically, impressive. The directing, the score, and all the performances stand above the good, if misguided, screenplay, making it an easy 8/10.

For the enjoyment score, it depends. I know you better than me, so I'll say if you are expecting a film that is as fast-paced and thought-provoking as the first, you are in for a discouraging and possibly depressing experience. If you are expecting a film that may not impress general audiences but can feed into that film lover in you, go see ""The Substance"" or rewatch the first one again. For me, my respect for the film helps to make the enjoyment score a 6/10. It's hard to determine who will like or love this movie, and I'm not even sure it's worth seeing in theaters. I didn't regret my time with it, but it may get worse for me with time, and you're better off waiting to rent or stream it on Max."
5.14,2 October 2024,"You know from the beginning that it won't come close to the first movie at all. However, the beginning of the film with the comic is clever. You want to see how the film will develop. The strong scenes that will make you watch a movie again are missing, while the songs for such a movie are too many and many times they don't even seem to relate to the situations taking place.

The character of Harley Quinn has nothing to do with what we know from the comics. The end of the film is completely disappointing. Poor script, bad idea for a musical.

Joaquin Phoenix is amazing once again.

Lady Gaga would make a nice Harley Quinn if she had the chance to develop the comic character more."
