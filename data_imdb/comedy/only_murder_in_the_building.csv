9.0,22 October 2021,"Season 1 (9/10) When this series came my girlfriend wasn't especially interested. I'm a huge fan of comedy mysteries and loved Steve Martin when I was young, but her enthusiasm for either is mild.

But after five minutes I had to stop and make her watch it, because we are New Yorkers and this series nails New York in five minutes. The weird relationships with by-passers, the artsy types, the justified paranoia, it was all there and immediately hilarious.

The series is about a trio of murder-podcast fanatics who bond over an actual murder in their luxury apartment building. Soon they are investigating and podcasting. But they are also each keeping secrets from one another in a wonderful mysteries-in-a-mystery structure. Everyone has secrets, the series says, and digging deep is fascinating exercise.

The cast is terrific. Martin is low-key funny, Short, who I am generally lukewarm towards, is very funny as a flamboyant theater director, and Selena Gomez more than holds her own as a hilariously snarky temporary tenant.

This show has been a hot-ticket item as far as I know - certainly my friends (and fellow New Yorkers) love it - so I was shocked to see how many user reviews just hate this show, or only find it mediocre, to the point where they insist all favorable reviews are paid for. This response is inexplicable to me. The show is amazing. When a new episode dropped we watched it immediately. It's just so, so, so, so good.

Ignore the naysayers, this is a must watch.

Other seasons: Season 2 (8/10): A shade weaker than the first season, but still excellent.

Season 3 (6/10): What the hell happened? Season 3 had Steve Martin playing his character as a complete idiot and after 2 great seasons, Selena Gomez turned lackluster - more glum and less snarkily witty. And when the mystery was solved, oh my God these were the most nonsensical motives you could come up with.

Sure, there were still good moments, good guest stars, surprisingly enjoyable songs. But OMG."
8.0,11 September 2022,"So I just finished watching Only Murders in the Building and have to say I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I originally had no intent on watching because it looked like a show aimed for people 60+ years old. I was wrong. After seeing all the great reviews and all the award nominations for both seasons I finally gave in and watched it. It's a funny who dun it kind of show. It's about three strangers who all love true crime podcasts and then all of a sudden find themselves making one of their own from a murder in their own building. These three (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin and Martin Short) start to put together the clues to find the murderer. The series has something for everyone. If you're looking for a show to just have a good time with and keep you entertained then give this a try. It's just a fun show that you can binge over a few days."
8.0,29 September 2022,"I was actually surprised by how much I liked Only Murders in the Building. There's a reason that both seasons have been nominated and won so many awards. The cast (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, Martin Short) and writing is what makes this show so special. Martin and Short play off one another like the legends they are and Gomez is a lot better actress than I expected. The three of them are just so likable and easy to root for in this series. This show was so good and every episode is so entertaining that I binged both seasons over the course of a weekend. It's a murder mystery show that has plenty of twists, turns and laughs. I'm looking forward to season 3 coming out soon. Season 3 should be the best yet with Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep added to the cast. Can't wait!"
9.0,19 October 2021,"When the initial episodes of 'Only Murders in the Building' started raking in 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, I must confess that I was skeptical that Steve Martin and co could keep up the quirky fun nature of this comedy-thriller series till the last episode.

But Martin Short, Selena Gomez and him form an unlikely yet rambunctious trio who keep us hooked and entertained till the very last episode of this brilliantly written, infectiously funny series.

Steve Martin and a fantastic Martin Short star as a pair of geriatric has-been performers who run into a young gild (Gomez) who also happens to be a fellow murder podcast fanatic. How this rag-tag trio come together to solve a strange murder that takes place in their apartment forms the rest of this story.

Although some comedy-investigative series' have had huge fan bases like Monk (2002-09) and Psych (2006-14) this genre has always been a tightrope walk that most creators shy away from.

Finding humor in the most unlikeliest of places and filled with unexpected twists and turns and a host of delectable supporting characters, it is no surprise that Steve Martin was also one of the creative geniuses behind the writing of this work.

Leaving us on a tantalizing knife-edge with a cliffhanger climax, I cannot wait for Season 2. Well worth the 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating. An immensely bingeable, suspenseful, laugh riot!

Highly recommended!"
8.0,7 September 2021,"We all know that Steve Martin and Martin Short can combine to produce comedy gold, but who could have predicted that Steve Martin and Selena Gomez would have such incredible chemistry? Add in the wonderful Nathan Lane and now Sting (!) and after just 3 episodes I am completely hooked."
10.0,2 July 2022,"Love everything about this show from the opening credits to the cast to the music.

But why oh why ruin it with the god awful casting of Amy Schumer as herself. She's awful. Then you have Cara Devilgne whose just as grating.

Both need to go quick."
9.0,18 September 2021,"This type of lighthearted and quality comedy and show is hugely lacking in this day and age! I am really enjoying this show so far.. I think it Steve Martin and Martin Short are comedic geniuses and the banter throughout was very natural and fun. I was a bit skeptical at first because of the seemingly odd choice to cast Selena with these two classics, but it totally works! üëè"
10.0,31 August 2021,Good writing fantastic casting and a brilliant story . I'm hooked .
10.0,31 August 2021,A great cast. Lighthearted and funny. Just what we all need...during the horrible times we all have faced in the last year and a half. Nothing dark to drag you down here.
6.0,28 June 2022,"First series enjoyable, the introduction of Amy Schumer is annoying. She isn't funny and can't act. It's really ruined it.

I'm hoping it's a shorter term introduction like sting in first season rather than a Permanent cast member."
10.0,25 September 2021,"I love Steve Martin. I do, I do, I do.

But I have to say, Martin Short is the funniest person on the planet and I already love this TV show.

I don't even care about true crime podcasts. I think they're weird and that morbid fascination is not healthy. Also, I'm too old to know who Selena Gomez is. But I do like detective stories and this one is original and laugh out loud funny.

But this show is that good. Watch it."
6.0,9 October 2024,"When I first found ""Only Murders In The Building"", I thought it was clever, funny and kept me wondering what would happen next. Season Two picked up nicely where one had left off. The dialogue was great.

However, Season three found me feeling as though they were undoing what made this show unusual.

Now we are at Season 4 and it's like a piece of gum after you chewed it for an half an hour. It's tastelessly bland, uninteresting and more trouble than it's worth.

Sad, really. Martin and Short are great together and Gomez was tolerable. Adding all these cameos was a big mistake. They didn't need any more than the cast on hand in the 2 initial seasons."
5.0,11 November 2021,"I saw all the good reviews for this and decided to give it a go. I'm so disappointed cause I really expected this to be good. It was just ok. Felt kind of forced and a bit too silly for me.

I enjoyed Martin Short's character but I didn't think Steve Martin was that funny in this which was a shame. Kind of felt like a male version of Grace & Frankie... with Selena thrown in to widen the viewer age range.

I like Selena but for whatever reason she put on this dull, monotone voice throughout the whole thing which began to really grate on me a couple of episodes in.

I'm hearing impaired and the deaf episode just felt too much. All the hollow, muffled sound in that episode was just really annoying for me and left me turning my hearing aids down. I understand that they are trying to be inclusive but just felt weird.

Not the worst thing you'll ever see but definitely not an 8/10."
8.0,20 September 2021,"This show is a joy to watch. It's witty and light-hearted, which is exactly what we need right now. Very reminiscent of Clue."
10.0,23 December 2021,
9.0,10 November 2021,"Some barely plausible characters end up starting a podcast on a murder that happens in the tower block they live in.

I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

*EDIT SEASON 2* Season 2 starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that don't land and Amy Schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party.

But by episode 3 it is all back on track Well done!"
10.0,31 August 2021,"This show is so refreshing, the casting is so good. It has the right mix of comedy and mystery. Selena, Steve Martin, and Martin Short are the trio we never knew we needed to see on screen. 100% recommend this to everyone."
10.0,31 August 2021,"Seeing the dynamic between the trio is really fun to watch! Selena performing along side comedic legends must have been intimidating but she holding her own and performing spectacularly. She's a great actress and on her way to potentially join the legends in the future. Look forward to seeing the rest of the series and more from Selena Gomez in the future! The soundtrack is beautifully scored. Well done Siddhartha Khosla!

Definitely one of the best released shows by HULU and in my opinion one of the best this year!

A MUST WATCH!"
10.0,31 August 2021,"Watched the show tonight, its funny, witty and the mistery is actually very enjoyable and gets your attention sincs the beginning.

The acting trio is really charismatic and has good chemistry. I thought it was going to be a Steve Martin/Martin Short thing but i was very surprisded with Selena Gomez. Her oerformance was great and you really get drawn to her performance and scenes. Maybe this will open opportunities for hwr in the acting industry, she deff has some chops!"
7.0,31 August 2021,"A well made gentle series, Steve Martin does all the heavy lifting acting wise, Selena Gomez provides a bit of 'young' input and Martin Short some moments of silliness.

The plot is a bit jumbled, but that is intentional to create a bit of mystery, it also has a slightly cartoon feel in the costuming and art direction.

It's not gripping or tense more curious and fun, some of the critiques and scores here are over the top, it's good but not that good. Also the short episodes are annoying, 35 minutes minus the intro and titles is too quick, best to let 2 or 3 episodes build up and then watch the 2 or 3 at one time."
8.0,22 August 2023,"I previously rated the show an 8, but i have had to lower the rating after season 3. I loved season 1 and 2, but I'm just not enjoying season 3 as much. The main characters seem to have different personalities.

The show in season 1 and 2 was warm, engaging and funny, but a lot of that is lost in season 3 somehow.

I personally don't really like the musical theme of season 3, but others appear to love it.

The reveals are obvious and easily guessed at the beginning, and aren't very interesting/twists.

The writing seems way less serious, as though they know it's a stupid premise so haven't put as much effort into the writing.

Overall I am disappointed with season 3, the ending certainly wasn't worth dragging out 10 episodes for. Would love to see the show carry on, more similarly to season 1."
6.0,26 October 2021,"What can i say? Really well filmed, great cinematography, steve martin and martin short are a great duo that works perfectly and selena gomez is good on handling her role with these two legends. The show is funny and has a very good pace, with sting, nathan lane, jane lynch and tina fey showing up.

The episode with nathan lane's son is a brave effort on his own and i did enjoy this resolution. Due to being really good it will certain gather a bunch of emmy nomminations. If you are not watching this yet, you should. The binge will be quick because this is extremely charming and entertaning."
3.0,5 September 2021,
10.0,15 September 2023,"The first season of this series was ok - especially Steve Martin's character and comic work. The later stuff has started to meander and is not very entertaining at all.

Why is it that series producers feel compelled to milk every last drop out of an idea, rather than leave on a high and sail away gracefully.

I suppose the real problem is that the streaming services are calling out for more and more product. To heck with the quality. That is very unfortunate for viewers and in my mind it is embarrassing for experienced entertainers like Steve Martin.

Overall, not really watchable any more. Sadly."
9.0,8 November 2021,"And boy are you with ""Only Murders in the Building""! This clever miniseries is a parody of/homage to true crime podcasts, with Martin's and Short's characters (along with a young woman played by Selena Gomez) investigating a murder in their New York apartment building. Plenty of surprises are in store, and there's great chemistry among the cast members (including some guest stars).

You're sure to love every part of it."
10.0,23 October 2021,"This is so cleverly written! The acting is also great, though Gomez is the weak link in the chain.

The story is very well written, the dialogue is believable. The cast is great despite Gomez' weak pedigree. But everything else was absolutely worth seeing again and again. Very, very funny and smart. The mystery is very compelling and engaging. I love it.

Highly recommend."
10.0,29 September 2021,"They have some good, episodic cliffhangers, but for me, the charm of the show revolves around Steve Martin's and Martin Short's catalog of works - their expressions alone make me want to laugh. Selena Gomez is an excellent balance for the two comedians. The additions of Sting, Nathan Lane, Tina Fay and more, put it over-the-top for me."
9.0,17 August 2022,"I do like her, butttt holy cow, her acting has gotten worse over the years. Her monotone delivery is ear stabbing. Cara and Amy are horrendous as well."
10.0,5 November 2021,"But with a nice addition of Selena Gomez, who I didn't know could act, although she mostly plays third fiddle to show's greater talents of Martin Short and Steve Martin.

I hate the term binge-watching but that's exactly what I did with Only murders in the building - it hooked me from the start, not just because this show reunites two thirds of one of my favorite childhood cinematic teams (Chase-Martin-Short trio from 1986's Three amigos) but also because the premise sounded promising and once I started watching I couldn't really let go.

As all of the murder mysteries go, this one follows the same beaten formula of twists and turns, suspects and innocents with an unlikely trio to lead the investigation the police seemed to have dropped from the get-go. So many questions and most of them get answered my the season finale (can't wait for the second season by the way) and overall atmosphere of the show, although a bit pretentious and too predictive at times, captures and opens up the characters to the core so much that we instantly fall in love with them and route for.

The gem above all is Steve Martin's Charles with his once big now small and broken little man who just wants some peace and quiet but rushes headlong into life as soon as another person loses it and finds friends he seemed to have long forgotten how to make. Martin Short's Oliver is his usual charming self with his own interesting story yet to unravel and Selena Gomez' Mabel is an extraordinary insertion to the team of 70 year-olds which gives it that life and vigorousness they all (including the tenants in the building) needed.

Above all, besides the outstanding performances by the cast, fantastic soundtrack and one-of-a-kind episode 7 are among this show's greatest moments and I hope it would get only better and bigger in the upcoming season.

UPDATE: Season 2 certainly did not disappoint as it added more mysteries, more colorful characters and more depth to the already established ones and the ending - bring it on, season 3!"
7.0,31 August 2021,Really fun. The best trio ever. Mabel mora is my fav character ever . Highly recommended.
8.0,24 September 2024,"I have watched this perfectly casted bunch of actors religiously for 3 seasons. Season 4, not so much. The path it's taken, just doesn't do anything for the draw to keep watching. The storyline has always been exactly what it took to be excited to watch the next episode. While I understand wanting to mix it up a bit to keep it interesting, I just don't get this idea of bringing in other named actors for the twist and turn of a different storyline. Everyone in the watching audience I'm sure has their own take on this changed season, but for me keep the original group of fine actors and just change up the situation. Cheers to those 1st 3 seasons!"
7.0,4 September 2021,
4.0,10 September 2021,"I know we are only four episodes in to this series, but I am really enjoying it so far. It is dark, funny, topical and has a little bit of mystery. I am not a huge New York-o-phile, but I appreciate the appeal and the willingness of this series to poke fun at itself. This reminds me of how much I enjoy and have always enjoyed Steve Martin.

I am seatbelted in and can't wait to see where this story takes us.

The series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in New York called The Arconia...or at least our three strangers turned podcasters think it's a murder, the police think it is a straightforward suicide. The three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast (the podcast is done by a character played by Tina Fey), everything is not ok in Oklahoma. When the three of them discover there has been a death in the building, they decide to come together to solve it...and naturally do a podcast about it.

Amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylines...everyone seems to be hiding something, which is a great set up for a who-done-it."
8.0,31 October 2021,"This is the strangest collection of reviews I have ever seen. It seems that most of the reviews are from people who love Selena Gomez and are answering back to a lot of the reviews where people obviously hate Selena Gomez. All of these ""9"" and ""10"" ratings don't seem genuine for such a take it or leave it show. It doesn't have the ""oh, I gotta binge because I can't wait to see what happens next"" feeling. It is more like ""It is just ok"" or ""meh"". To give it such high ratings means it compares with the greatest things you've ever seen. Did those people just come out of hibernation? There is something off here."
10.0,21 April 2023,"Why is Selena Gomez in a show with a talented cast?? She just doesn't fit. She doesn't know how to act, her character is is so stiff with NO personality or emotion, and I can't stand the way she talks, she talks like her mouth has been wired shut! Also, you can hardly hear her! I feel sorry for Steve Martin & Martin Short, two great actors to have to work with someone that seems to put no effort into her character/acting. I'm, guessing she was cast in this show only because she has a huge fan base and most followed female singer on IG?? Why not give the role to someone more talented? A real comedic actress? This show could be so much better without Gomez."
8.0,31 August 2021,"One thing I love about this series is the characters. When the trio are always together, they create chemistry. I have to commend Selena's brilliant performance here. I thought that choosing Selena Gomez as a co-lead actress with the comedy legends, will not work very well. However, I underestimated this woman and turns out she's doing what I want her to do. Never expected to love this show at first, but I'm saying it right now - watching this show is a must. It is definitely one of the best shows released by HULU and one of the best TV shows of this year!"
9.0,2 September 2021,"I'm a long time fan of Steve Martin and Martin Short so I had to check out this series. Their past collaborations are electric. Im not aware of Selena Gomez's work but I know WHO she is.

After reading other reviews, it's fairly obvious there are many Selena fans who wanted to voice their overwhelming approval of her performance to pad the rating. Those ""reviews"" stand out because they are not really reviews, just kudos because they are ardent fans. Tell us WHY you liked it!!!! I'm sure many who stated such and also stating their admiration for the other leads' past work was a token. I can't imagine the fandom realistically includes legendary septuagenarian comedic movie and stage actors and a Disney popstar. If I had a dollar for everytime I read the word ""amazing"", I could produce the show.

I digress - this show, after 3 episodes is fabulous!! I hate most TV shows created in recent years. Comedies are formulaic, recycled crap. Drama is redundant and stale. I give some with an interesting premise a chance - 99.9% fail. The ONLY network shows I like now are NCIS, the original, and Young Sheldon. Streaming: Stranger Things and Alien TV. Yes, I'm odd that way. Castle Rock was cancelled, so.... I love quirky original concepts like 3rd Rock from the Sun, Big Bang Theory, the aforementioned Stranger Things and Alien TV ,etc. This show has it all. It's hilarious, dramatic, thrilling, mysterious, eclectic, thatrical and insane all at the same time. It's a definite rollercoaster ride of emotions. If you didn't bust a rib with the cats ""arrival"" on scene then you are dead inside.

Steve Martin is his usual sardonic self and teaming him with Martin Short's over-the-top theatrics - their sarcastic banter is always entertaining, add to that Selena Gomez's deadpan snarky often dismissive repartee with them is priceless!! They have fantastic chemistry for their 3 very distinct personality types. I'm quite impressed at her ability to hold her own with these two and it was so refreshing to hear a young woman have a lower register voice for once and NOT hearing ""super"" this and that constantly. C'mon people, there are other synonyms for that word. It makes you sound silly and unintelligent.

The storyline kept my attention and I love how they cut to each characters unique perspective in interpreting the clues they have; Short ""auditioning"" the tenants and Selena's visions/delusions. They throw in backstories with flashbacks and ambiguous habits to build the character profiles.

Finally, the supporting cast - masterful casting in my opinion. The tenants are the kookiest group of people you could ever imagine and they all live in the same building!!! Nathan Lane AND Sting as well!! Great!!

I was sad when episode 3 ended, I now have to wait until next week but it's worth it. You never know what will happen scene to scene or for that matter, what may come out of their mouth.

So yes, millennials and Gen Z...Selena was AMAZING!!!! So are the rest."
8.0,31 August 2021,
8.0,31 August 2021,"And then I found this hidden pearl. I've seen the first 3 episodes and I'm liking it. Phases like in Episode 2 ""just say anything to agree"" yeah, my kind of humour. I'm really hoping that they will make the sensible decision and don't stretch it if this does become a success and they see dollar signs, because then we are again in for bad writing, bad plots and 100% bad final episode."
7.0,8 October 2021,"Steve Martin. Martin Short. Nathan Lane. I could watch them all day. Takes you back to a different time, yet the storyline is so relevant. I loved this so much."
10.0,24 August 2023,
7.0,27 October 2021,"This was a phenomenal show! It is so much better than I thought it would be. I started watching this show late. I didn't start watching it till 6 episodes in. I saw commercials for it before it aired, but it didn't peak my interest. Then, weeks later, I am scrolling through Disney+, this show catches my eye, so I decide to start it. (I live in Canada. We don't get Hulu, Disney+ Canada imports some of Hulu's shows to the country). I binged the first six episodes of the show in under 48 hours. I then had to wait for episodes weekly which is normal. Because this show is a murder mystery, I feel making the fans wait a week for each episode built so much more suspense than if all episodes were released on the same day. I loved everything about this show. The acting, the writing, the characters, and the story. Martin Short, Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and everyone else, and I mean everyone were absolutely perfect in their role. My favorite was Martin Short as Oliver Putnam. The character of Oliver was so quirky and funny, and Martin Short was perfect for him. Oliver wasn't the only perfectly written character. All of the main three, as well as the side characters, and all the suspects were so unique in their own way, especially most of the suspects. They were all funny. It was perfect. Lastly, the writing of the show was perfect. The writers made the perfect murder mystery. The suspects, the leads, the red herrings, all perfect. I also loved the character development of the characters. It was cool to see their backstories.

This show was incredible. Everything about it. I 100% recommend this to anyone. Trust me, you won't regret it. They left us on a massive cliffhanger at the end of season 1, I need to find out what happens next. Can't wait for season 2!"
3.0,8 October 2021,"The show is cleverly done, with comedic brilliance from Steve Martin and a light enough touch for just about everyone. But Selena Gomez is unwatchable ... her intonation is flat as roadkill and her expressions are barely any better. She is so annoying to watch that my wife refuses to watch the last two episodes. It's quite a tribute to Martin, Short, and any others who were involved in the writing that the show is as popular as it is."
10.0,7 July 2022,"Before I start this, I think season 1 is an absolute treasure, 10/10 from me! The plot is great, character relationships feel real and authentic, and just the feel of the show is just captivating!

Okay, lets start off with Amy Schumer. I know her role is giving mixed opinions, and rightly so. The way they presented her in this is not well written at all! I think this was a last minute decision and they didn't have too much time to write her character a good story. Also, her playing herself... doesn't make sense in this show. I get the whole keeping celeb thing intact but come on now, it's just a bit too random.

The next point is Cara Delevingne. She should not be in the show at all! It simply doesn't suit her or the show! She plays a bit of a wacky painter and enters the show through Mabel. Now her character entry is okay... but in general, this seems too fast paced and there is ABSOLUTELY no chemistry between her and Selena! It feels so forced and unnatural, what on Earth is going on. Please tell me these two do not actually get together, it seriously feels empty and cold! Don't get me wrong, both Selena and Cara are good actors but them being in a relationship... yeah unfortunately we need to pull the plug on that, as I said before it was SO forced, rushed, and awkward. I honestly want to know what was going through the writers, producers, and directors' heads when they saw this scene!!

My final point, the plot is fine but after seeing the first three episodes, it's not drawing me in like season 1. When watching season 1 I literally could not wait for the next episode to come out, but season 2... I really hate to say it but the series has lost its magic :(. I told all my friends about this show and didn't ever shut up about it too! Such a shame.

Takeaways:"
8.0,30 July 2022,"I think overall Season one was quite good. Steve Martin and Martin Short, while not a magical duo, worked very well together, especially as each others' straight man. In think we all agree the false leads was overplayed and season one could have been perhaps two episodes shorter.

Season two, in contrast, is just insufferable. The writing is cringe. The humor has changed from subtlety, repartee, and irony to entirely dumbed down sophomoric or physical humor that simply does not work. I dare anyone to show how and where this is a script with any intelligence at all. Where is there anything that would even bemuse a New Yorker. Were are the funny references to well known Manhattan foibles and uniqueness? The only one I saw in the entire season was stolen directly from Woody Allen. And this seasons supporting cast is there for what exactly? Selena Gomez did a yeoman's job considering her struggling with serious illness and being thrown in with the mega talents.. Great comedic star? No. But she did well considering. People should know the original script did not include her character. But Cara Delevingne and Schumer? Please, their inclusion is forced, artificial and they add nothing at all.

The repetitive gushing positive reviews of Season Two here on IMDB are glaring in that they are uniformly not specific. (they also include a lot of repetition, making many possibly shills) What is so enjoyable about it? They don't say. I can only guess it is because they got more of the jokes because it was so dumbed down? And what on earth is with the ticking of every woke box? I can see that if it supports the story, but how does that does that support the story here? It doesn't. It seems like a glaring and forced substitute for quality writing.

Enjoy Season One, skip Season Two.

Season One: 9/10 stars Season Two: 2/10 stars."
10.0,31 August 2021,This is is honestly the best one ever. Old school comedy with a drizzle of thrilling experience in it. Selena Gomez's sarcastic role and the 2 comedy legend's old school humor is just perfect. Three of them remain to be the main character there's no overshadowing each other here and I'm loving it. A MUST WATCH.
10.0,23 October 2021,"I love my share of ""who dunnits ?"" Sometimes I have to take a break though because I start to feel a little unsettled watching too many of them. This one brings the mystery, but is also strangely a little more lighthearted, as weird as that sounds because it is about murder after all. This was unique in the way it has a comedic, satirical spin that completely works. The three leads are unlikely friends but they have great chemistry together. The ending gets a tad silly, but again, it works with this show whereas it may have not in other more serious murder mysteries. A negative factor is the show's episode is less than 40 minutes and you have to wait to watch the next episode until the following week. At times it feels like more ads than substance. However, can't fault the show for that. Glad it was renewed. Hopefully season 2 has a bit more of a shocking twist and the reason for the murder is a little more complex than season 1, but overall, really enjoyed this!"
10.0,1 September 2021,I love the show and can't wait to see the mystery unfold. But as a teenager I think the language is a bit severe. Wish they didn't use those words that much in the show. But other than that I think it's great!
10.0,1 September 2021,Love the cast and especially selna gomez really add some great colors to the show.
6.0,31 August 2021,The acting from everyone is just so natural and the humour isn't forced. Loved it. Selena Gomez proving once again that there's nothing she can't do. Steve Martin and Martin Short showing their powerful dynamic once again but with the added bonus of the Gomez. 100% WOULD RECOMMEND.
10.0,31 August 2021,"This series is simply wonderful! The charisma of the characters and the plot holds you a lot and right in the first episode you're amazed. The series has a really nice mood too. The production is also very good, and not to mention the performance of the actors that is sensational, especially Selena Gomez who showed what she came for. No doubt this series has come to be a major contender for the emmy."
6.0,11 December 2021,"Trying to be goofy with two wild and crazy guys, the show bogs down every time Selena Gomez is in the scene. Decent cameos and the Sting puns rock but I don't expect I'll be checking out season 2."
2.0,31 August 2021,This show is incredible. All the acting and the plot are amazing. Especially Selena Gomez with her return to tv. She embodies character and delivers every line perfectly.
10.0,28 June 2022,"Cannot stand Michael Rapaport in ANYTHING!! He ruins anything he's in. Keep the formula simple. Amy Schumer??...Ugh! Short, Martin, & Gomez are great in this (as they were last season). Short especially. Gomez is the hidden gem on the show. Martin is always incredible in everything he's in."
10.0,21 August 2023,"I only watched season 1 and it was okayish, barely. Thinking back, I don't know why I didn't give up on it faster. It's not particularly funny, nor ground breaking, it's not even even that interesting. Steve Martin and Martin Short are the only redeemable aspect about this, but they can only do so much with what they are given, so they're not great either. I think I'm maybe nostalgic about them since I used to always watch them while growing up.

Now, Selena Gomez.. I don't dislike her or anything in general, but here.. her acting is really, really bad. Is she even trying? She delivers her lines in such a monotone way and she lacks any comedic timing.

If the script wasn't so bad, she would be enough of a reason to not watch this.

It's up to you, but I would pass on this one."
10.0,21 September 2021,Good show but the show is to short for a week to week drop. Hulu should have invested a little more into it. I didn't know I would have fall in love with it.
9.0,24 October 2021,"Writing writing writing The writing is so good and not wasted on characters' back stories, each character serves a purpose.

I hope it continues like this next season."
10.0,21 October 2021,"So good to see Martin & Steve on screen together again, and their chemistry with Selena is great. I loved the whole aesthetic - costumes and set mixed with the scoring and music is fantastic. Great mystery, funny, endearing and clever."
8.0,27 October 2023,"I started to watch the show with the mindset that this would be a light 30 minute episode comedy to shut down your brain in those lazy days, yet I was surprised how engaged and entertaining it turned out to be!

Steve Martin and Martin Short are long time collaborators (and I assume friends as well in their personal lives) so their chemistry is unquestionable, this on its own is a major positive aspect of the show.

Murder mysteries are a Hollywood classic and there's ton of content already on this topic so it's hard to be original in the realm.

With that being said this show actually does that in a refreshing way! The chemistry is, again, the glue of it all, the comedic duo gives the heart and are the major source of comedy, which on most cases is well timed so we have plenty of funny moments.

While being a light hearted kind of show, the murder plots are actually interesting and well designed, of course some folks are obviously not guilty and depending on which episode you are it might become more clear who de culprit is, yet the moments leading to the inevitable revelations are great and most of all they make sense which is something not all murder mysteries get right.

I did enjoy all seasons including the third, while it becomes more far fetched as more seasons are made (season 1 and 2 murders are more plausible while the third could arguably be debated as stretched) I still felt that the plot was interesting, the actors involved did an amazing job, they really went for an all start guest list of actors!

It's a well written story with great depictions and it maintains that balance of being a TV show about murders while at the same time it feels like a cozy light hearted family comedy.

I do struggle a bit with Selena Gomez performance, I've seen her in other movies and I don't think that she is a bad performer but her delivery on this character feels off and distant, you get used to it at some point but I don't know why she seems to struggle to deliver intensity or charisma to the character, although her chemistry with Steve and Martin is great!"
6.0,6 September 2021,I 100% recommended. Yes its only 3 episodes in but its so good and I'm so happy to see Selena Gomez in acting. Its a Disney plus original everywhere and HUlU in US so watch it.
9.0,31 August 2021,"This is definitely a series worth watching, 3 episodes in and I am hooked! Only Murders in the Building not only has a star-studded cast, but a hilarity in its dark material that makes the series totally binge-able and entertaining. If I could compare it to another show it would be Search Party. I can honestly say I can't wait to see how this ends.

The only problem I have with this series is that it was not released in full in one day, I hate waiting around to watch it on a weekly basis like its 2004.

Update: 12/24/2021

I rewatched the series and would have to say that although the first time around this show was exhilarating to view, the second time did not hit as hard. I LOVE the show, I think it was fantastically produced, the sets are gorgeous, the dialogue is funny, the characters are well written. However, I would agree with most of the reviews this time around that the twists were predictable and could be seen from a mile away. Nonetheless, the series is still one of the best to have come out in a while, it was quirky done right. Definitely going to watch it again soon!"
7.0,5 September 2021,Great story and the men are great. When Selena Gomez opens her mouth Im taken out of the story she is really on the surface and sounds like Kermit the frog. Is that her usual voice? Soo weird.
2.0,1 October 2021,"Steve Martin and Martin Short are great as always, and Selena Gomez does a good job of keeping up with them; better than I expected, She is not as bad as a lot of these reviews make her out to be. Overall it is a very enjoyable show, a little different than most of the garbage on TV today. (For instance, let's make yet another NCIS with a bunch of unlikable people doing the same old tired things in a new place. But I digress...) I love Nathan Lane in anything, and all of the actors do a good job. I am looking forward to more twists and turns before the final reveal. My one criticism is Episode 7, the silent episode. I get it, very artsy, fartsy, or maybe just an attempt to show what it is like to be deaf. Whatever the reason, just because you can do something does not mean you should. I do not stare at my TV when watching it without ever looking away, so this was very difficult to watch. Also, I missed the texts and some stuff because it was too small and I could not see it. Needless to say, I feel frustrated because I missed a lot and I do not want to watch it again; once was torture enough. So please do not use that particular method of filming again."
10.0,8 October 2022,"I really liked season 1. It was great. There were signs of things to come with all the emphasis on how wonderful in every way Mabel is. Eye rolling in the extreme. It's intersectional feminism. She's called ""amazing"" so often, it's ridiculous. That aside, the writing was solid and engaging and the irritations I felt could be compartmentalised and didn't ruin the overall enjoyment of the mystery. If Steve Martin wasn't in it, however, I would probably not watch.

The intersectional post modern writing is very sadly turned up to 11 in season 2. What on Earth is Amy Schumer doing in this? Or Cara Delevingne? The quality of the writing took a dive. I don't think they had a plan for season 2. Well, if they did, they have done a very poor job with execution. One good season will have to do..."
10.0,23 August 2023,"First to seasons were excellent. This Third season is so lost, convoluted. The show lost its direction. It's seems to me they are turning the series into a show about the creation of a broadway play and lost the most important and compelling point of the what this was originally about MURDER and how this eclectic threesome were able to solve the crimes with the added bonus of a pod cast I believe for some reason the show has gone off the rails, it has lost the uniqueness that made this a really good series. I truly hope the show can get back on track but for some reason it has gone down a rabbit hole and it seems to be losing its original charm."
10.0,31 August 2021,"It's very good the two martins, comedy vets who we all know and love have an outstanding performance here and Selena gomez is a welcomed addition to the iconic pair. The writing is witty the mystery is set up very nice, and the sets and costumes are very well made. There is a sense of privilege within the characters but that's what it was trying to do. Sometimes the comedy doesn't land but it's a treat to watch all these amazing actors do their job. 10/10."
9.0,21 September 2021,"Was looking for a good show to watch and just stumbled upon this show. Saw it had Steve Martin in it and that got me interested. Martin Short in it got me even more interested. When I started watching it I didn't even realize Selena was in it. Liked her character and acting. Great to see Martin and Short to their old selves again. Kind of felt Martin fell off with the Pink Panther movies. But the writing is great, the acting is great and they managed to capture this certain vibe I haven't seen in a movie or series for quite some time. Definitely a fan. Hope they can keep up this standard."
10.0,1 September 2021,"Very lighthearted, easy to digest, and amazing characters. Not difficult to understand or catch on, despite being a crime show also."
10.0,21 September 2021,There seems to be a lot reviews downplaying the acting by Ms Gomez. She is playing a character to embody stereotypical Gen Z and I think she does a fantastic job (f-bombs and all)! Steve Martin and Martin Short bring classic comedy and writing while Selena Gomez helps provide a modern spin. I also appreciate Nathan Lane to throw in some Albert Goldman vibes. The writing is funny and sweet. My only complaint is I wish the episodes were a bit longer. I definitely recommend a watch!
7.0,23 September 2021,Great show great cast I'm really enjoying the show so far.
9.0,31 August 2021,This show takes an interesting approach to murder mystery and keeps you intrigued. The main characters compliment each other well and are so funny.
6.0,20 August 2022,"Not my typical review because I feel like I might be the only one bothered by this. Firstly, I promise I really like the show and before anyone says it yes I know Gomez's character is supposed to be like that, but the monotone and stiff Mabel keeps distracting me from the story. Like, I struggle to take her seriously I know it's not Gomez herself because she is a good actor so clearly that's how the director wanted Mabel to talk and act. I really wander if anyone else feels this way because I know it's a specific little thing but I can't get over it. So, besides that personal issue it's a good show and I highly recommend it."
4.0,24 September 2021,I really have enjoyed the show the banter between characters is engaging from sarcastic to heartfelt feels like a convoy I'd have with my friends when I'm tipsy. Steve is perfection character wise and Martin is like can you be by uncle or grandpa I'd love a guy like that in my family. Selena well plays her 20ish character to a freaking tee (touch bit entitled but still exudes confidence & respect). So far loving the story line and input from characters a bit refreshing from normal comedy type dramas some seem so hokey pokey this one seems more down to earth shall I say believable. I'm hooked thanks for the show guys.
10.0,14 December 2021,"It's very well made, just that Ms Gomez's horrible acting ruins it every time she is on. Forget about the dialogue delivery, get expressionless face makes the series unwatchable."
9.0,7 August 2022,And they decided to take a great show and destroy it by throwing in Amy Schumer Michael Rappaport and the lesbian angle OF COURSE! Sheesh! Thank you Hulu I mean not surprised by the heavy handed commercials that are rampant on your platform.
8.0,23 September 2021,"I love Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys! Like ND and HB, this show has a lighthearted and mysterious pull. I absolutely love the actors, they have a great dynamic. This show is without a doubt binge worthy. I cannot wait for the rest to drop!

Note- Tip for the people knocking 10 star ratings, go find a different genre. I have this show 10 because I get exactly what I want from it, laughter and relaxing mystery. I'm not looking for a panic attack at 10 p.m. I just want to relax and watch some of my favorite people.... So yeah it is 10 stars."
10.0,1 September 2021,"The cast is great, with comedy legends and Selena Gomez shining in her role as well. It's a great blend of comedy, lightheartedness and thrill, making it a great watch. I def recommend if you are looking for something new to watch."
9.0,29 September 2023,"Let's just say this show is one of the ones that keeps you wanting to watch more after the episode ends! It's has great comedic scenes, but it's also a mystery thriller, it does a good job of keeping it funny but serious at the same time... it can make you laugh one minute and the next you're hanging on the edge of you're seat... the acting trio of Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez plays very well together who would of thought?! Only thing I'm worried about is just how many seasons it can go on with the same type of plot line but overall very watchable obviously like any show it could be better but overall it's a 8/10 would recommend the watch."
10.0,27 October 2021,"Absolutely fantastic series! Totally hooked from the get-go. Brilliant cast. Excellent writing.

WHAT a cliffhanger! Cannot wait till Season 2.....which just got the green light!"
7.0,9 November 2021,"Martin Short, Steve Martin, and Selena Gomez are SO FUNNY in this. It takes a couple episodes to hit its stride, but once it does it's LOL funny. There's silly physical comedy and great dialogue banter, and the chemistry between the 3 characters is awesome. The mystery itself is light and fluffy, so go into this expecting more of a comedy than a murder mystery, and you'll be satisfied."
10.0,19 October 2021,"Slow at the beginning but as characters are introduced got MUCH better. Martin Short is his usual self, Selena Gomez's character is very flat & dry (probably written like that) Steve Martin is neurotic & lonely. Jane Lynch is hysterical. It's a madcap mystery/comedy - reminded me of It's a Mad, Mad World. Throughly enjoyable - Looking forward to a 2nd season."
7.0,30 October 2021,"Only Murders in the Building has an interesting setting, a nice prompt, cozy atmosphere, and great cast. However, the three main characters, with their undenayable chemistry and interesting background stories, were far more interesting than the murder case itself, which was presented rushly."
2.0,26 October 2021,"Not only do I love whodunit style shows, I live the actors. I've always been a huge fan of Martin Short since his SCTV days. Steve Martin has a great dry humor that pairs well with Short. Finally Selena Gomez rounds out the trio with her youthful insights and wit. I can't wait until next season!"
10.0,26 July 2022,I don't get this casting. She can't act and she's not funny. The writing for the other characters is still witty (especially Martin Short!) but I find her to be a distraction.
10.0,29 June 2022,"While I rated the first season highly (with a unique set of actors and compelling story), the second season appears to be a rehash without a new twist. More Hollywood fluff versus a creative comedy that we saw in season one."
10.0,24 October 2021,"It was a fun watch. It was decent, at the very least. Not sure if my standards are just getting lower and lower these days or I just actually liked it. Although I'm pretty much sure I would watch season 2 when it comes out."
10.0,1 September 2021,A perfect cast. Lighthearted and very funny. Just what we all need...during the horrible times we all have faced in the last year and a half. Nothing dark to drag you down here.
10.0,31 August 2021,"From the first chapter you want to discover more about the series, the three protagonists really combine and it seems so natural that I enjoyed watching it, I'm already excited waiting for the next chapters‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
10.0,1 September 2021,"If you're debating on watching it, give it one episode. I promise you'll be hooked. I decided to watch this because let's be honest.. I can't be the only one who misses seeing Selena Gomez on screen? The genuine friendships between the actors are so aparent and perfects the chemistry within the show and makes it WORK. SOO GOOD. 10/10."
6.0,31 August 2021,"Arguably the best series of 2021. Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, and Martin Short all in one show? It's a guaranteed hit. Gomez's comedic personality in this show is everything. Make sure to give this show a watch, you'll love it!"
10.0,1 September 2021,"Already hooked on this show, mystery is interesting yet still easy to follow, and the comedy aspect makes it easy to binge watch. All three leads did an incredible job on this, can't wait for the next episodes."
6.0,10 October 2021,"They're trying to keep it interesting with plot twists, but was expecting to like this more. What stands out to me though is that Selena Gomez's voice is really grating on me."
3.0,31 August 2021,"The show is a delight to watch and contains themes of comedy and mystery. The acting by all the characters, especially the main characters, helps to execute the plot in a phenomenal way. All in all, this show is definitely a must watch!"
10.0,1 September 2021,"Must be people involved with the show, hoping to up the ratings and get people to watch. Not a good tactic, I'd say.

I tuned in because I'm a long-time Martin Short fan, but I found Short's energy and charm to be brought down by Steve Martin's character, who seems aloof, and by Selena Gomez's, who seems uncomfortable, not to mention rude."
10.0,12 September 2024,"I liked everything about season one. Selena Gomez made everything work. Steve Martin and Martin Short needed something to balance their slapstick.

Season two dropped my rating of the series down to a 4. Everything felt too tired. Still, I watched the entire season. Who knows why.

I returned for season 3 when I saw Meryl Streep on the cast list. Sadly, the blah ha blah ha blah ha drowned her out. She is one of my favorite actors.

I am watching season 4 episode 2 as I write this. I may or may not make it through the season. Making it through the episode is also in question. The actors playing the actors who are going to be in the OMITB movie set a new low for the series.

It seems that most series go well beyond their Sell By date. With Only Murders that might have been season 1."
8.0,1 September 2021,"Show of the year!! Funny , and gets you hooked up."
9.0,2 September 2021,"Well the two comedy kings have shown their power. Every scene is dramatic, mysterious and funny . Selena is back in her best . She is as good as Sherlock Holmes."
10.0,7 September 2021,"This is an absolutely hilarious and spellbinding series. However, it would be great without all the F-bombs. It's as if they are just thrown in over and over to get a rating that might attract more viewers. I'm no prude, but this is really an excellent series and doesn't need to have that included to make it great."
10.0,1 September 2023,"I enjoyed the first two seasons, though mainly for Martin and Short, but the third season is just drifting aimlessly and episodes have gotten repetitive.

Characters wander about spouting limp dialogue with the rare flash of humor, and then someone finds a ""clue"" in the last scene that points to another character possibly being the murderer, but that character will have an alibi in the next episode so they start all over again.

Even Martin and Short look bored this season. And Gomez has never added anything to the show. She's completely out of her depth as a character and ""actress.""

She stumbles about with her dead eyes droning out words in an irritating nasally voice that makes you stop listening as soon as she appears. Even the occasional flashes of cleavage and lesbian kiss from last season haven't made her interesting.

As for guest stars, Streep is always a joy, even with little to do, but Rudd is completely wasted.

I'll keep watching but unless this thing kicks it up several notches (and maybe Gomez flashes more than cleavage) I suspect they won't have a fourth season.

Then again, based on Martin and Short's attitude, I doubt they'd care."
7.0,1 September 2021,"The type of series I love to watch. There's not many shows like this currently so I'm excited that they did this. I love the cast, Martin Short & Steve Martin are legendary and are known for being great comedic actors. Selena Gomez is also a great addition to the Duo. Already hoping for a season 2."
10.0,31 August 2021,
7.0,9 December 2022,"Steve Martin and Martin Short make this show worth watching. Selena Gomez on the other hand is so bad that it's painful to watch the scenes she's in. She delivers her lines as if she read them from a large sign, teeth clenched and staring emptily. It is hard to believe that she would have landed this role if she hadn't financed part of the show. Please replace her in season 3!!! Maybe a small animal could take her place.

Season 2 is slightly better that the first one, so it seems they are still looking for a suitable form for this show. Combining comedy and drama/crime is not an easy genre, but Steve and Martin know their trade."
5.0,31 August 2021,"This show is something, I loved this show starting with first series! This show is definitely show of the year!"
10.0,10 October 2021,"Stick it out, the show gets progressively better.

It isn't as good as half the reviewers say, nor is it as bad as the other half say.

It's a light hearted show that won't give you many actual laughs, but it is cute and clever in a Martin and Short kind of way.

The storyline isn't very engaging at first, but it definitely gets a fair bit better after a few episodes. I almost gave up a bit into episode 3 but I hung in there. Episode 3 is a bit of a turning point, that's when it starts to get interesting. I'm now on episode 6 and the story has gotten quite good.

It's a decent ahow."
10.0,18 September 2022,"With powerhouse comedians Martin and Short this should be non stop funny. Unfortunately it's tiresome, slow, NY-centric annoying, and of course caters to the required intersectional nonsense which distracts unnecessarily from the core context of good story writing. Gomez cannot act, let alone open her mouth to speak properly. Martin is slow, somewhat funny but seems a bit past his prime. Short is funny and energetic but could be unleashed more to propel the show forward as the monotone Gomez and sleepy Steve Martin hold it back. Nice effort, good visuals, clever format, but too many neurotic cliches and not quite the zest I was looking for based on my expectations."
10.0,29 June 2022,I love this show. So much. Can not wait to watch the season 2. So excited. Until.... Amy and Cara are in this show. Please make 'em go away! Their acting are ruining the show. Not a big fan of the two of them.
10.0,1 September 2021,"Amazing tv show, it's nothing like I expected and it exceeded my expectations. Y'all should give it a try, seriously! Plus, Selena does an awesome job, it's nothing like she's done before and oh my god, she eats the roll up."
10.0,17 September 2021,"I have missed the quirky very Steve Martin/ Martin Short type of upbeat comedy that was so popular in the late 1980s-2000 and have found myself really missing it....until....

HERE IT IS AGAIN!

A little off-beat, a lot witty with some New York style sarcasm thrown in, this show is a murder-mystery in an apartment building with three strangers and nothing is as it appears on the surface.

NUFF said about the PLOT.

The acting is Steve Martin. Classic Steve Martin. Who remains fabulous. And Martin Short. Also always a winner. Selena Gomes is a fun addition to their act. Highly talented and quite enjoyable.

I will be looking forward to the next episode every week!"
10.0,31 August 2021,"This show was so refreshing, no comedy has done it the same in a while. With the awkward silences and the down to earth real raw emotion in this show, it's bound to be an Emmy favorite!"
6.0,1 September 2021,"I haven't watched a sitcom since Frazier went off the air. As so many others have already written, it is witty, engaging, entertaining and all out fun. It does't pander to the lowest common denominator nor insult a viewer's intelligence. The writing and performances are spot on while the story captivates the viewer. Playing along with The Who Dunnit, I felt like I was at dinner theater mystery rather than my living room. I can't wait for the next episode!"
10.0,31 August 2021,Highly recommend 10/10 This show is best in mixture between criminal and comedy wow. Love all the cast.
6.0,27 August 2023,"S1 was so good 2 & 3 were not good, specially when cara delevingne came it was unwatchable just couldn't bare watching her scenes.

When I started watching this show it had me laughing out loud and eagerly awaiting each new episode. The first season was a breath of fresh air, with clever writing, witty humor, and a cast that had excellent chemistry. The show seemed to have found its comedic stride right out of the gate. It's unfortunate that the show didn't recognize its peak and instead decided to keep pushing forward with more seasons. In retrospect, it's clear that the show should have heeded the old adage, ""quit while you're ahead."" The first season was a delightful gem that left a lasting impression, but the subsequent seasons left me wondering why the show's creators didn't know when to call it quits. It's a disappointing reminder that not all good things are meant to last, and sometimes it's better to leave the audience wanting more than to overstay one's welcome."
4.0,31 August 2021,"This series is amazing! The story, production and acting of the actors is spectacular. I was surprised with Selena Gomez, her acting is great. I highly recommend watching this series, everyone will love it."
10.0,22 July 2022,Seriously do the directors of these US shows have a checklist?? First season brilliant. Second season enforced changes that make zero sense like seleba gomez character suddenly having her cake AND eating it. And as for amy schumer..............
9.0,30 June 2022,First season was smart and funny. Schumer adds an awful stupid angle. She steals scenes and I hate seeing her. Perhaps if she could act that would be helpful.
10.0,31 August 2021,I can't stop watching it's so good They all did a great job in love with the show Selena queen of acting real did what she had to do.
10.0,6 September 2021,"Such a great and funny show! Love this trio... Please, we need more Episodes üòÄ"
10.0,31 August 2021,"This show is a must watch !!!!

Just saw the first three episodes and I am obsessedüòç"
10.0,31 August 2021,Fantastic! Rarely does such a smart show last long but here's hoping it will. This show is very well written with just the right amount of comedy and a perfect fit for the current True Crime Podcast trend. The two Martins work well together and Ms Gomez is perfect in her role. Can't wait to see more!
6.0,31 August 2021,
9.0,31 August 2021,"It was really good!. Such a good series to keep away with, so interesting. It is awesome to watch selena acting again!"
6.0,3 August 2022,"It is awesome to see Steve Martin and Martin Short at the top of their game. The show lets them have fun and take viewers on a whimsical ride at the same time. It's unfortunate that Gomez' acting detracts from every scene she's in. I can't figure out if her exaggerated affectation is intentional or if she's just that bad, but it's pretty jarring. Still a fun romp, but not must-watch TV."
8.0,1 September 2021,"Like many others, I listen to true crime podcasts all the time. This show is perfect for that large demographic. Its also really funny and keeps you engaged at all times. Can't wait for next weeks episode!"
10.0,13 September 2021,"Can someone replace Selena Gomez? No doubt she is gorgeous, but she can't act. Her acting is so plain makes me cringe. Please, casting director. Don't ruin the series.

I'm giving it 6 because Michael Short, Steve Martin, Amy Ryan (i'm a huge fan of hers), Sting, Tina Fey, and other neighbors; stole the show.

I like the concept. If writers can read the reviews. Some scenes are not necessary."
10.0,31 August 2021,"First Off: The show is average. Average and that isn't bad. If you think Knives Out is the best mystery ever created you will love this. If you are a fan of everything from Death In Paradise all the way to Father Brown Mysteries you will think this is average.

The start is not needed... The three telling a tale of ""their"" new york isn't needed. It's too ""woody allen"" and it's like bad poetry... Artistic decisions only look artistic when done for artistic reasons. This reeks of trying to hard to be intellectual. There of course is the obligatory ""women get raped by men cause it's a mans world and wah-men"" reeled off by Selena Gomez.

This isn't novel or unique. In fact it literally follows the same beats as so many before... To the point where Ultra City Smiths lampooned it only a few weeks ago on our TV screens.

The positives. Steve Martin and Martin Short. They are legends and this isn't a ""payday"" for them. This isn't phoned in. I will agree with that. Amazing from them. Selena Gomes. I love her. I am not a huge fan of her music but her personally I actually like as she has never come across the same as Miley and Tay-Tay... Both seeming up their own... Ahem... Ms Gomez has always seen like the cheerleader that didn't want to be mean like the other vapid airheads but couldn't help being attractive and popular. I am so glad she is normal in this and that she plays someone that isn't just a 20-something idiot. She actually is playing a functioning adult!

The cinematography is lush. No other words for it. Money spent well. The acting between the 3 is amazing.

Now the negatives.

The pacing is off. The story is taking too long to set up. Exposition can be done far more naturally. The start is elongated and filled with horrible little cliches and tropes. The pilot is bad... But I give the show a 6 as pilots aren't usually the peak of a show.

The mystery is not that smart with the only good aspect being that they are fans of podcasts... No different to the main character of Zomboat being into zombie movies or things like Truth Seekers. It's been done and worse still... You should never touch a subject that Rhyse Sheersmith and Steve Pemberton have touched with their amazing Inside Number 9.

The pilot follows Campbells Journey way too much... At the 18th min mark they literally hit one of the steps on time...

As for the reviews... Anyone that has given this above a 9 needs a word with themselves. Worryingly on here and google the reviews seem fake made by people that have had their profiles for less than a week.

Is it bad? No. It is amazing? No. It's average. Worse still it's a hackneyed mish mash of Agatha Christie tropes. We have them all here... From Miss Marple to And Then There Were None.

As for the podcast thing... It's a bit 2018 isn't it?"
10.0,31 August 2021,The characters complimented each other. It was thrilling and funny at the same time. I grown up watching the three of them. Never I have imagine that those 3 will make a good team of amazing actors.
10.0,1 September 2021,I loved the first episodes and I'm really looking forward to the next ones to come.
10.0,1 September 2021,Selena is everything üòÅ show is different in a good way.
7.0,4 September 2021,"It's definitely unique and I love the creative direction of it. However some of the acting is not up to par in my opinion and it's a bit slow. But nevertheless I love it, excited to see how it grows üå∑"
10.0,2 November 2021,"Just a quick review, but I will say this show is absolutely sublime. Honestly it is the best show I have seen in a while. Very clever and very funny. A perfect mixture of satire, comedy, mystery, thrills and physical play.

The trio of lead actors just fizz with chemistry, and the story builds with a steady flow of twist, turns and farce. But what really makes this show shine is the brilliance of the characters interplay that keeps you mesmerized and hooked.

The music is also a nice surprise from the well written theme tune to the clever choice of music in the different episodes.

DO not listen to the haters, they know nothing. This is the real Deal. Happy to report that the long wait of Steve Martin and Martin Short back on the screen, is well worth the wait! And the very talented Selena Gomez definitely holds her own.

Sit back and enjoy top class acting and a first class script.

Cannot wait for season 2!!"
6.0,23 October 2021,"There are probably similar shows but there are also hundreds of shows one can watch, on regular tv and all these platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+. But when I gave this serie a try, I was pleasantly suprised as I can't remember to watch a similar serie like this as I could really relate to one of the main characters of the shows, an amateur detective trying to solve a murder crime. Therefore, I love the serie. I just hope it won't last too long as 9 out of 10 series, quality drops after the 3rd or 4th season."
3.0,19 September 2021,

10.0,13 July 2022,"I realize that we're trying to appeal to a younger audience, but did there really need to be a F@ck f@cked f@ck f@cked f@ck f@ckly f@cked tirade in the second season? Seriously? I guess swearing was easier than writing something better. Not needed, first season was better in every way."
10.0,23 October 2021,An amazing storyline and the characters are entertaining. The music is great and I give the show a 10/10. The show is very interesting and not at all what i expected but it's even better. I really hope there will be a lot more upcoming seasons from this show. And at last the details are amazing.
10.0,25 October 2021,"Firstly, ignore the haters. If you hate whodunnits or things that do not rely on gore/extreme violence, nonstop cgi action, gratuitous use if the f* bomb, and/or sports, then this is not the show for you. It's also not about rebellious mensa youths playing chess.

But, if you like murder mysteries/whodunnits, and are looking for something clever, fun, and just a tad lighthearted despite being about solving murders, please watch this show. The filmmakers do a great job of taking the podcast medium and bringing it to life in an entertaining and colorful way (more entertaining, in fact, than many actual podcasts themselves regardless of your imaginative capabilities).

The casting is fantastic and the main 3 protagonists have a great chemistry together, really bringing life to their characters. And while some supporting roles aren't fleshed out too deeply, you get a great sense of the overall ecosystem of sorts at the Arcadia through the protagonists adventures - which is all that matters here. It isn't the deepest show or the most dramatic, but it's approach to death, our differences, and the weird things that can bring us together is honest, thoughtful, and genuine. Yes, there are silly moments, and silly characters. But this is a comedy - and unlike other shows/films purporting to be comedic, does actually contain amusing things. As a millennial, I enjoy a real range of genres from romantic period pieces to rob zombie style horror, but, at the end of a long day, I truly looked forward to each episode drop of Only Murders as something light- but still thoughtful - to enjoy and decompress. Really looking forward to season 2."
10.0,31 August 2021,"This series is wonderful. The story, production and cast is spectacular."
10.0,1 September 2021,OMG! I loved see the selena GOMEZ act again. Its soooo good.
6.0,4 September 2021,"Only Murders in the Building is fun and entertaining from the start. I caught a review from David Bianculli on Fresh Air just prior to the show's release that grabbed my attention and had me marking the release date on the calendar. His review is spot on. The show is as good as advertised. Those disappointed after expecting a novel and superior crime/mystery series are partly missing the point. The mystery cliches are part of the humorous parody. The podcast plot line provides an amusing relatability - many watchers will know the experience of discovering a friend or acquaintance shares an affinity for the same true crime podcast (e.g, Serial, etc.). The enthusiasm for such podcasts is noted with a hilarious reaction by a detective outside the murder scene to the three main characters snooping around: ""Goddamnit, What F'n podcast are you all hooked on?"" Many viewers will also connect with the characters from a childhood and/or adult secret desire to be a real crime detective.

Martin, a co-creator, is more subdued and cynical in his role, allowing Short and Gomez to balance either side of him with their typical high-energy and dry sarcasm, respectively. Gomez really shines and her character has depth. The viewer gets to share the tension and conflict Mabel must feel hiding her secrets from the other two.

This show hooked me like I hoped it would when I heard about it, and I simply can't wait for more."
10.0,1 September 2021,"This is fresh story, amazing cast, full of thrillers and suspense. Can't wait to see how story unfolds in upcoming episodes. First 3 episodes keeps you on the edge of you seat. And love to see Selena Gomez on on-screen."
7.0,22 September 2021,"This is a pleasant show. Steve Martin and Martin Short are fun to watch. Selena Gomez was fine in Wizard's of Waverly Place and a few Disney made for TV movies but she is really wooden here. Maybe it's the direction, but her performance so far is mediocre. The story moves along slowly but at least it moves."
5.0,1 September 2021,The show is so fun! The cast is amazing and SELENA GONEZ ate the role.
10.0,7 September 2021,"I am liking this show well enough after 3 episodes. First of all, Selena is gorgeous as always and also somewhat coy and mysterious. Good on her landing this gig.

But some things bother me a bit. The attempt to be edgy seems to just be gore and swearing. There is not a clear direction on what the target audience is. Is this for young adults, old people, what??? I watch things outside my target demo, but I want that to be a consistent experience. I don't flip on some Looney Tunes from my youth expecting it to be adult oriented, I want it to be a kids cartoon. So far I'm being pulled in a few different directions so it's a bit annoying.

From an acting perspective I think Martin is standing out. He fits the character as written almost to a T and seems to jump out of the screen at you. On the other side, Steve just doesn't quite work for me and I've never really considered him a top level actor anyway. But he still kind of works as a contrast to Martin. As for Selena, let's all be honest here and admit she's just not a top-level actress, but she's cute and is clearly there to counter the two old guys with her youth. And as we've seen in the trailers (no spoilers), she's a central character but so far maybe hasn't had a chance to flex her acting range. (I'm also throwing out the question: what is up with her speaking voice? Her tone is so very nice as always but her enunciation is off almost like she had a jaw injury.)

Another comment on the acting in general is that everyone seems to be a bit distant. Put another way, I am not seeing as much chemistry as I would like. We'll give them some more time to warm up but for now it's almost like each person is acting to the camera, not to their costars.

This show does give me vibes of ""The Flight Attendant"", which I also liked, but sometimes it feels like they copied some things here and there. Could just be me..."
10.0,8 December 2021,Boooring but I am forcing myself to watch it to the end out of respect for the comedy giants in it. The dialogue sounds like it was written by an average Joe in a coffee shop. Just awful.
10.0,1 September 2021,I just can't stop think about the secrets behind this murder.
10.0,31 August 2021,"Great acting, excellent cinematography, and great script! A good balance of lightheartedness with elements of mystery as classic 'whodunnits' have."
10.0,31 August 2021,"It really doesn't get any better than those 2. Surprisingly, Selena Gomez is doing pretty good in this show with acting she fits the part. I cannot wait till they release the new episodes!!!"
10.0,31 August 2021,"I've been waiting a long time, I'm already looking forward to new episodes, very excited!!!"
6.0,31 August 2021,"I adore this serie! It's sooo funny and interesting, and the actuation is *üíã*!!! Y'all should watch it right now! 10/10!!"
10.0,3 September 2021,"This series has me hooked, it's unique, fun & suspenseful. I see a couple bad reviews claiming it's not much of a ""thriller"" but that's the point, the series is a mystery-comedy and it's suppose to have some comedy and it's not meant to be thriller, also we have Steve Martin and Martin short they are comedians so it's to be expected the show was going to have some comedy. I recommend watching this if you enjoy true crime, mystery and comedy, because this show has them all and it's very unique and different from other shows. Also Selena Gomez shines through along with Steve and Martin, they're all an incredible cast."
6.0,28 September 2021,"For a show in which the casting was the main hook, it doesn't seem to work that well between them. Gomez is off, bland, doesn't fit and it's only more obvious when put against the backdrop of Martin and Short who actually have great dialogue between them. But that's really all they have. This show forgot plot so it kinda plods along sleepily. The pacing is off big time as well. That said, good side characters and surprisingly well directed, but Selena was the wrong call in casting."
3.0,31 August 2021,"Amazing cast , plot, binge watch worthy excellent performance by the actors loved it."
10.0,1 September 2022,"Funny, campy and weird. An easy to watch crime comedy that takes you all over New York and keeps you guessing. It's well produced and has a decent cast.

The jokes can get a little repetitive and forced; especially the ones about age and Charles' (Brazo) 'bad acting'.

Something that cannot be ignored though is Selena Gomez's acting. Emotionless and wooden when she speaks, almost not even opening her mouth to deliver the lines. It's very distracting. I don't understand why they could not have found someone else for that role.

Still looking forward to Season 2 though and I heard there may be a season 3 in the works."
10.0,23 August 2023,"First two seasons were excellent but struggling with the third. Meryl Streep is very overrated and is so lack luster all the Tim. Don't get me started on her thinking she can sing! It's also lacking the pizzazz of 1&2. The story is very blah and boring. Paul Rudd is fantastic as always just really wish he was in more scenes and longer. While the Martian and Steve chemistry is good, it's definitely running its course and needs to wrap it up soon. I hardly find and laughs in this. Weird characters have joined the cast, a mother son relationship that is pretty awkward, boarding on incest. I hope this is the last season."
10.0,31 August 2021,"The best show of 2021. I Loved it so much Selena's acting is superior she's so wonderful and amazing actress also, steve Selena and marty are the trio I never knew I needed."
10.0,31 August 2021,10/10 one of the best show of Hulu & my favorite already . Grt job Selena(mabel)-my fav character.
10.0,11 September 2021,I absolutely loved the moustache on that bloke at the dinner party.
9.0,31 August 2021,"My new favorite show!

All 3 characters are shading and funny!"
7.0,31 August 2021,"Can we talk about the twists in this amazing series?? It picks slow but you will get hooked after watching second episode. Let me not begin to talk about the actors. Steve, Martin, Selena are fabulous. I can't wait to see Aaron's part in further episodes."
10.0,28 June 2022,"I loved season one,i anticipated season two and then suddenly Amy Schumer appeared. Amy Schumer thanks for ruining season 2 for me! You couldn't be less funny!"
7.0,7 September 2021,"I know I'm going to upset a lot of people here with this one, so I'm going to get it out first... I'm not sure Selena Gomez was the right person to put up against two comedy powerhouses like Martin and Short. As dynamic and outstanding as these two, Gomez is equally flat and uninteresting.

Adding in guests to the show like Tina Fey, Sting, et al. And she really pales on screen with her flat affect.

Other than this, I'm a huge mystery fan, usually British mysteries, but this has enough of a feel to compare to those and I'm enjoying this show very much.

The story line grabs you from the moment Martin says, ""Only murders in the building!"" Given it's a mystery, it moves slower than I'd like. But... British mysteries usually wrap up very quickly, so I'm allowing this to not bother me. I like how the character's lives are fleshed out so we can know them better.

The show's not at all heavy or dark, other than the fact they're investigating and podcasting about a murder in the building. The jokes are also light and the byplay between characters is enjoyable.

It's my sincere hope when this one is done, Martin and Short will consider others, sans Gomez, but with a more talented actress."
1.0,16 September 2021,"This remind me so much of game Clue, in the best way possible. I want to know what will happen next as what I expect never happens, which makes the story and writing brilliant, making me on the edge of my seat, awaiting the next episodes."
10.0,6 September 2021,"Because this is definitely binge-worthy. Martin and Short are back at it again folks and it's exactly what the world needed. Both are aging like fine wines and are just as funny (Steve Martin) and dramatic (Martin Short) as ever. I can't wait to find out the complete story and ""who dunnit.""

E. T. A. - Though I find the show entertaining and definitely would have watched the entire season in one go, Only Murders in the Building isn't the kind of show I'd watch every week. I realize that sounds a bit strange however it's the kind of show I might forget about or, I likely would choose to watch something else over this if I was in a time crunch. I may wait until the entire season has been released then go back and watch all at once."
10.0,17 November 2021,"When I saw its promos, I became very excited, seeing big names, experienced cast. But it was a let down. Too slow.

Did we really need to know that much of the characters' back stories? The current happenings could have been made more interesting. And considering wide range of colorful characters living in the building where murders occur, the tv show turned out to be very bland.

I held onto my patience for upto the first quarter of the 3rd episode before giving up on it."
10.0,19 October 2021,"I LOVE IT ALL!!!! The cast is perfect and effin' adorable together!! I can honestly say... that, for some random reason I never was a Steve Martin fan... idk why, I've never watched any movies with him in it ever really... BUT, nowww... I adore him!! And Martin Short is, I mean, come on... awesome!! And then Selena Gomez, which I can say, I was pleasantly surprised by her as well! Loved it!! Two thumbs up! Gold metal! Lol I'm excited for a season 2 to see what happens next and then hopefully a show with many, many more seasons!!"
10.0,16 September 2021,"This show is funny and warm with great acting, fabulous characters, and an absorbing mystery storyline. I expected all that, but really didn't expect the tenderness among the characters and the depth of the characters. These are just superficial characters with slapstick jokes. Sure, it's funny, but it's heartwarming and heartwrenching at times too. Grade A entertainment."
10.0,16 September 2021,"A high quality production from top to bottom, well done and thank you everyone concerned."
10.0,6 October 2021,"This Midwestern girl loves this show! Steve Martin always so likeable since forever. I've seen him with his band several times. Fan since SNL. Martin Short, never a fan, but he is brilliant in this! I'm going to have rethink and review Martin Short! Selena, didn't know she was an actress but she is believable and very interesting to watch. Those eyes and body language! The fans outside were well chosen. The kid on S1 E8 1:57 what a face! Hoping he and ""The Fans"" are incorporated into the storyline somehow. Not done, LATER!"
7.0,21 September 2021,Stylistically refreshing for a murder mystery comedy. I found myself laughing and repeating lines throughout the evening.
10.0,31 August 2021,"Selena is back with a bang!!!!!!!!

The leading trio is everything.. Highly recommended."
6.0,17 September 2021,The whole premise of the show seems intriguing but the show is very slow with not much going on I don't understand why the rating is so high maybe is all the Gomez fans.
1.0,31 August 2021,Light hearted and so much fun to watch and selena killed it.
10.0,1 September 2021,"Not sure what kind of television these 10 star reviewers watch but this show is 6 at best. The production is good but the plot is certainly not inventive.

I am on ep 3 and am over Martin Short's annoying character. More Selena, more Bunny. Not on the edge of my seat, more like edge of sleeping."
10.0,2 August 2022,
10.0,1 September 2021,"I like the fact they use modern features such as podcast, and mix them with a crime but at the same time funny story. Very entertaining and Selena is stunning here."
10.0,1 September 2021,"The show is amazing, Selena, Steve and Martin are the trio we never knew we needed! Btw I have to say that Selena Gomez acting is just out of this world!! I'm obsessed with OMITB and can't wait to see ep 4."
10.0,4 October 2021,"Though it wears a face of a mystery, it is as much as ""Three Amigos"" were a western.

This is a festival of interesting characters, not taking itself very seriously. The last thing you want to do is guessing who dunne it. Just pay attention to everything around the plot and you'll have a great time.

It brings back the vibe that got buried lately by self absorbed writers and wooden actors. If you consider it over the top, well, it is, on purpose.

The rating wouldn't have been 10 if the market wasn't riddled with ""Me, me me, I'm so important"" characters, but in times like these, the 10 is a no-brainer."
10.0,6 September 2021,The trios chemistry is very good. Only 3 episodes in so far so good.
6.0,1 September 2021,Selena really did a great job üëèüèº Mabel is my favorite so far; I love her character.
10.0,1 September 2021,"For fans of cozy mystery and crime stories, this is a gem. Steve Martin and Martin Short have allways been favorites of mine, and Selena Gomez fits in well in this trio of amateur detectives... seen two episodes, cant wait for the next ones."
7.0,3 October 2021,The show has been interesting but has way to much needless F words. It doesn't add to anything and just makes the show seem vile.
2.0,20 October 2021,"Only Murders in The Building is a masterpiece. It is perfect and I love it. Every episode is perfect, there is not one flaw with the show. It is a much watch. It might be my favorite show of all time. The performances are fantastic, Marty Short gives a perfect performance as Oliver Putnum, which is probably his best performance and Steve Martin gives a excellent performance that is one of his bests. Selena Gomez's performance really surprised me, she can really act and she was just great, I mean great in this. Without giving spoilers, the story and the other side characters and tenets are also perfectly acted and casted. Nathan Lane was amazing, I mean amazing. His performance and character was one of my favorites. All three of the main characters interacts are real because they are great together off set and Marty and Steve have always been hilarious in this. This show is so funny I laughed out loud so many times, it was so funny. The directing was so good, I was very impressed. I am invested in the story and the characters. All the episodes were perfect but the finale was amazing and that cliffhanger was so perfect, I loved it! I can't wait for season two! I want a lot more seasons of Only Murders in the Building!"
8.0,3 September 2021,"After 2 episodes I am still watching. The cast and production quality are obviously top notch. I have always loved the casual nature of Steve Martin's acting. Half the time he doesn't even need to say anything. But he feels a bit underused at this point, especially considering he created and produces the show. I want to know more about his character (maybe it is coming). The character played by Gomez is set up very well, the dialogue is good and there is ample intrigue. It would be a bit harsh to say Gomez cannot act. It could well be the direction is also poor. What is with the monotone nature of her voice? It sounds to me like she is just reading the script out loud most of the time, barely a hint of feeling in the words. I get the distinct impression she is trying too hard. There is no energy to her acting. But it must be a bit daunting to play opposite her co-stars. I will give her a chance, let's see where this takes us."
10.0,7 April 2022,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is painful to watch. I tried to watch the first four episodes to see if the series would get better but it only gets worse. The premise is absurd, affronts our intelligence and the dialogues seem straight out of a high school play.

The series starts with a murder in the middle of New York and the Police assume it's a suicide and worse still, three residents of the building with access to everywhere and everything start an investigation and a Podcast about the case.

Veteran actors Steve Martin and Martin Short are completely wasted in this series and Selena Gomez, unfortunately, does not convince as an actress. This series is just awful."
10.0,28 June 2022,Show is great but Amy Schumer kills season 2!! Season was well written had pretty much everything for a dramatic comedy. Good to see Steve Martin and Martin Short back together again. Selena Gomez is always good and glad to see her back acting again. The three of them work well together. Steve Martin and Martin Short have great playoffs as they always had as in previous movies. I'm not sure why they added Amy Schumer to the cast but they could have done better. She doesn't fit in with the rest of them. She tries to be funny but nothing she does or says really hits. Her comedy in stand up isn't funny either so she was a waste of a cast member. The producers could have gotten a nobody to fill her role. Can't wait for the rest of season 2.
10.0,19 September 2021,"I started watching it a few days ago and I love it. Steve Martin is brilliant as always, Martin Short is hilariously neurotic and Selena Gomez proves that she can hold her own with these comedic legends. This is the show everyone must watch this fall."
8.0,17 September 2021,"SHE NAILED IT SO FAR. THE 5 EPISODES JUST SO GOOD. We can't forget abt the other actors either omg, steve martin & martin short & aaron dominguez omg preach for them too they're such good actors & i love them !!! This is gonna be one of the best shows of all time i can see it."
10.0,22 September 2021,"This is awesome.

I love the combo like Crime, Murder Mystery, Thriller, Comedy really enjoy this.

Good Script and Brilliant Casting."
7.0,6 September 2021,"I really warmed up to this show. Short, Martin and Gomez have great chemistry. I like the old-fashioned decor and the moody atmosphere. The story is engaging and I will look forward to the rest of the series."
10.0,23 September 2021,"I'm a bit disappointed on how short the season was, since it was only 6 episodes and each for about 30 minutes. I loved the chemistry between all three characters, and I loved how there were a lot of plot twists in a short amount of time. And the show moved on pretty quickly as well. So ready for season 2!!"
7.0,12 October 2021,"Short and Martin are great, especially Short. However, Gomez is a distractingly bad actress. If not for the writing and the acting of the other two she would make the show unwatchable."
1.0,1 September 2021,The show is amazing so fun the cast did a great job.and Selena Gomez ate the role.
9.0,26 October 2021,"Most older viewers will go in to this to see Steve Martin and Martin Short team up while younger viewers are likely here for Selena Gomez. You will certainly get your fill as far as screen time goes, but not quite the best as far as performances go. All three are fine enough in their roles but we are talking a spoofy murder mystery here.

Steve Martin gets more humor and drama than the others and does well with it and generally being a lot less over the top than we are used to seeing him - which I found refreshing.

Martin Shorts character works more an annoyance that lets others be funny although he does have some funny lines, but much less than we normally see.

Selena Gomez is a bit uneven. She works best when she is investigating and not so good when she is supposed to be emotional. It can't be easy holding your own with this cast, but I do think she held her ground pretty well.

The story is a spoof about crime/murder podcasts and manages to go through many different phases during the 10 episode run. It started strong and then ambles along very pleasantly until it crescendos with a very good final episode. It feels comfortable all the way through and that isn't a bad thing. In this age of media violence this is a balm that I looked forward to watching each week and enjoyed until the end."
10.0,21 October 2021,"I have been a fan of Steve martin and Martin Short in their earlier efforts...but now...It seems they have suffered from Major Talent Withdrawal... and Selena Gomez, what a completely talent-less piece of work...she talks as if her jaw is still numb after major jaw surgery. And her monotone voice emits the F-bomb at regular intervals.. Apparently one of the major requirements to be a writer in Hollywood today is to inject as many F-bombs as possible . I fail to see how this series got labeled as a mystery/comedy when both elements are absent."
10.0,31 October 2021,"Only Murders in the Building is perhaps the most unique show out there right now. Martin Short, Steve Martin pair works like an well oiled machine.

The pacing of the show is just right for this genre. There was plenty of intrigue in the plot to make the audience glued to the story.

Right after the first episode the plot starts thickening and by the end we had a very nice well developed plot.

In terms of performance both Martin and Short did a commendable job. They were not only funny but also were emotionally invested in their characters.

Overall this is an exceptionally well written show. Looking forward for the next season."
10.0,6 September 2021,This is a really great show. I think Selena Gomez is really good in it. Martin and Martin are great as usual. This is well written and keeps you interested. I do not find it funny tho. At least not yet.
10.0,31 August 2021,
10.0,31 August 2021,Selena is very very very beautiful and the story is so good also i like it.
7.0,31 August 2021,"I always say I'm not going to binge watch next time I find a show I like but alas, I have failed again. This series is adorable, fun, and so far, anyway, bereft of any of the social agenda garbage virtually every show nowadays seems driven to inject. Just simple, lighthearted fun, reminiscent of when TV was actually entertaining. It does have a bit of profanity, but at least it's not blasphemous. I adore Steve Martin anyway, Martin Short is thankfully low-key, he can get annoying when he's over the top, and it's my first encounter with Selena Gomez, but she does a great job, too. Watch it!"
9.0,31 August 2021,I'm literally obsessed with this show. You have to watch this.
6.0,1 September 2021,"When I first heard about the show, I didn't had a lot of high expectations but I was so surprised after watching the first 3 episodes. The plot is well executed, the characters are multidimensional and there's so much to uncover about them. They are not what they seem like at first glance. Each episode leaves you wanting more and more as the story unfolds. If you want something fun and intriguing at the same time - congrats, this one's for you."

9.0,6 November 2021,"Found myself getting bored with it, but saw it through to the end. A few, very few, funny lines, and a story that isn't particularly interesting. And and do they have to say 'Tim Kono' every time they are talking about him? Wouldn't 'Tim' do most of the time. Some of the storyline was lacking in logic, and, unlike 'Curb your enthusiasm', I really wasn't all that anxious to tune into unwatched episodes. Appreciate the effort of all involved, as it's certainly not easy to write a who-dunnit, but given the cast, I expected to be laughing a lot more. Don't think I'll tune into season 2 unless the wife really wants to watch it. Fortunately, the episodes are only around 30 minutes long, so it's tolerable."
10.0,31 October 2021,"Only watched up to episode 2. Boring, dull and unfunny. Selena Gomez even acts and sounds bored of it. Nothing keeps you interested in the first 2 episodes to keep you watching any more."
10.0,28 October 2021,"A great series! Very funny, brilliant story, great characters and makes me want to go to New York Desperately. I'm not a true crime fan, and you definitely don't need to be to watch this either."
10.0,12 July 2022,"Look I love the show it is amazing, since episode one it has kept me constantly on my toes and I am so happy we are going to be getting a season 3, but I do not like cara and Amy's characters I mean I am all for progressiveness but what happened to Oscar I don't understand I mean did he and Mable not date???

Anyway grate show worth your time <3."
10.0,25 October 2021,"I Love the story line, I think my favorite was the Cat in the Freezer. Can't wait til season 2. A little more light in the picture, be nice it was really hard to see. Otherwise, it was good."
6.0,8 September 2021,"This is HANDS DOWN Hulu's best series. Full of comedy, thrills, mystery and murder. Steve Martin & Martin Short show their still strong comedic forces in this industry! Selena Gomez is at her best along side Martin & Short. Gomez's comedic timing and quick witted delivery is up with the greats of this show.

This show will be a staple not only in Hulu's ever growing discography-but the discography of each actor involved in this series."
10.0,1 September 2021,"Althought the reviews were good, I actually didn't except the show to be THAT good.

I've finished watching it 24h ago and since then I've been doing nothing but think about who the murderer is, I've been collecting clues and trying to hold a case (failing miserably but well), made about five different theories since then and even created a gc on to debate about them. Safe to say, I can't wait to watch the next episodes and hulu is sick for releasing ONE episode per week like what was the reason."
7.0,2 September 2021,"I have to preface by saying I LOVE Steve Martin and have since I was a teenager and saw him sing King Tut on SNL and as Dr Maxwell in the old Bee Gees Sgt Pepper movie. I made a scrapbook of him and everything. I feel he has rarely made a misstep in his career and I was thrilled to find out he was finally going to be in a series show. I love Martin and yes Selena too so... but there's a reason for the many high reviews as this show has it ALL! Truly laugh out loud comedy, great cinematography and sets and a truly twisty intriguing mystery that unfolds in a tantalizing way. I think the episode lengths are perfect too. Can't wait to see where this goes."
5.0,13 October 2021,"I like the show sometimes. But whatever is going on with Selena's voice is weird. Is she trying to talk like this, is she going through some physical struggle, is she trying for a certain effect? Did I miss something that explained this. Seems like all the reviews that say only the nicest things don't address this elephant in the room. It constantly takes me out of the plot. I have seen her so fun and full of life and her normal voice. Why this change? Please explain so I can enjoy this show fully."
10.0,31 August 2021,"Amazing, omitb is so good, i love to see it, congrats selena gomez!"
9.0,25 July 2022,"This show could be so much better- why did they choose Selena Gomez for Mabel? She ruins it for me. Luckily Martin Short and Steve Martin are kings, so they carry the show. But Selena? Could have picked anyone but her - she's so monotone and not believable in this role. Her character is not very likeable anyway so it's super hard to write anything positive about her."
10.0,28 June 2022,
10.0,7 September 2021,I can't give this show enough love. The amazing cast is obvious but damn do they work well together. The score is amazing. Can't help but to get excited when the opening song comes on. Just love it! Keep it coming!
9.0,31 August 2021,"I woke up and was like "" what should I be watching "" it has been a while since I watched something. So i was quite surprised 'cause i had no clue there's a Selena Gomez tv show ! It's been a while right!. I'm excited I watch the first two episodes and they are great funny and gloomy, it should be it's a gloomy Tv show after all. I know this has nothing to do with the show itself but I love Selena's outfits and color mixtures. Soo girly I know.

Any way enjoy this."
10.0,2 September 2021,I've been waiting to see OMITB for a while now and I actually signed up for Disney+ just to watch it. I enjoyed all 3 episodes and was left wanting more. These characters are very fun together and I'm glad to see Selena on TV again.
7.0,31 August 2021,"Good Clean Lighthearted Fun -- kq999, couldn't agree more."
9.0,31 August 2021,"Fantastic cast and a fun premise, two episodes in and this series shines. Unexpected, quirky, and well written, only hope it keeps this up for the remaining 8 episodes."
7.0,2 September 2021,"This trio was a good choice for an ensemble story. I really enjoyed seeing Steve and Selena of course Martin, playing on each others talents. I think this was the best casting fir the type of story that unfolds. A unique way to blend a little mystery with light comedy for sure."
9.0,16 February 2024,"This show is pretty good...but honestly it peaked in it's first season imo, which is a shame.

Season 1 was quite outlandish but in a controlled way. Like fireworks. Whoever decided putting coloured gunpowder in a pipe and setting it on fire - crazy. Whoever decided to shoot a bunch of them up in the air and make a display - genius. Season 1 is twisty and dramatic, a little bit hammy, a little bit clich√© and very self aware. The acting is solid, the mystery is entertaining and engaging, the resolution is great fun. It just works.

Season 2 is...fine. That's not fair, it's actually pretty good too, but it's essentially a rehash of Season 1 so meh.

Season 3 sucks. It couldn't hold my attention at all. The dynamic changed far too much, far too dramatically. The situation doesn't work, the character balance is off and the chemistry is dead. I'm content to pretend in my own little head that it didn't exist and the show ended at the end of Season 2."
10.0,2 September 2021,I've seen the 1st 3 episodes and I'm really enjoying it. The 3 different characters and their individual stories are unfolding is well done. Steve Martin can't do wrong in my opinion. Martin Short is of course great at doing over the top. I love Selena Gomez. The way she's playing the character reminds me of Lauren Bacall.
10.0,6 September 2021,"This is a show I was eager to see. There are aspects that, personally, disappoint - the pacing (Woody Allen used to do these things so much better, with an under-appreciated energy and precision), the peculiar interactions between the 'odd trio' (yes, I know Gomez's character is supposed to be somewhat disconnected from the older pair, but her behaviour in the early episodes is just a bit too odd and illogical to work for me), the already-cliched 'talking to a dead guy' conceit (after The Flight Attendant, and others, this needs a long, long, rest) and (I know, I know, these things are subjective, but...) Gomez's weird, ultra-constipated, nasal mumble - but the charm of Martin and Short makes up for any misgivings and keeps one watching. Like so many shows these days, this feels like a 90 minute movie stretched out to fill up a non-negotiable run of episodes, but it's entertaining even during its detours and digressions. Not a great series by any means, but a welcome one."
10.0,22 October 2021,
10.0,24 September 2023,"I stumbled across this by accident and quickly became obsessed!!.... It's literally everything all rolled into one... amazing writing, cast, acting, directing... The 80's/ 90's style comedy from the amazing Steve Martin and Martin Short instantly transported me back to my childhood, comedy duo genius. The facial expressions alone had me belly laughing.

If you're looking for a light hearted, funny, who done it series with cameo's from legendary actors this is definitely for you. It will NOT disappoint.

I binged all three seasons over a weekend and can't wait for the next one!!! Bring on Season 4!!!...."
9.0,2 December 2021,"I had already heard rave reviews on Only Murders on the Building and just by seeing the cast lost I knew it was going to be a good show. I was immersed in the story within the first 10 minutes of the first episode. I was happy to see Selena Gomez getting the recognition she deserves because, honestly, her role in Only Murders in the Building is truly amazing and I loved every bit of her acting. Regarding Martin Short and Steve Martin, I mean, what can I say. The ""OGs"" are back and better than ever. Loved their role and the touch of comedy they brought to the show.

Last but not least, there was something about the production and direction that made me fall even more in love with the show. It is so well directed and produced, from the color scheme, to the choice of venue to the secondary actors, I simply loved it.

I can not wait for the second season to be available. If you are debating whether or not to watch this and you like ""modern crime"", good actors and a touch of fun, you should definitely start watching it as soon as possible. You won't regret it!"
7.0,5 November 2021,"Im not a critic or reviewer by any stretch of the imagination, and, to be honest I've never written a review nor given advice about what anyone should watch - but with this everyone should give it a go... It's just incredibly, incredibly good. From the casting, performance's, set/location, story and writing, to the music in the background it's all perfect. Loved every minute - this sends my viewing into a whole new direction!"
10.0,22 October 2021,"Comic genius of Martin and Short can't help but make this one to watch.

You have to be prepared to invest and wait for the layers to unfold.

I enjoyed it."
7.0,21 October 2021,"Not sure what any bad reviews about this about. I went into this show with an open mind and i was not disappointed. Just finished the 10 episodes. SO entertaining, i cant wait for more. The acting is great, the cast is great. WHAT A FUN SHOW TO JUST RELAX AND ENJOY."
5.0,31 August 2021,"She's back like she never left. Hope she never sings again and just acts, she's a generational talent. This show is incredible, if you haven't watched yet definitely tune in."
10.0,27 July 2022,"I love this show but I cannot stand Schumer. She is a horrible, hateful person and it is ruining this show for me that they have her on. Thank goodness it is just two episodes, but that is two too many. Beyond that huge misstep, I love this show and the chemistry between the three leads."
8.0,2 November 2021,It had such a great cast of f characters. I find it interesting and relaxing at the same time. Definitely something to look forward after a long day. I am so happy to see Steve Martin and Martin short in this show. They are as great as they have ever been.
10.0,6 September 2021,The 10 star reviews have to be fake. I'm watching for Martin and Martin. To read some of these you would think Selena Gomez is the best actress since Meryl Streep. I don't know much about her music but her voice is so annoying. The show isn't horrible and it's not great. It's something to watch.
10.0,29 February 2024,"Watching season one now. It's an interesting story. Steve Martin and Martin Short are genius as usual, always a great pairing. Martin Short, in particular, is hilarious. I've never watched anything with Selena Gomez in it before so I had no prior opinion. Her speaking voice is beyond grating. I didn't know it was possible for someone to speak nasally and monotone at the same time. Kind of like that Roz character from Monsters Inc. If you can get past Selena's irritating voice and the excessive, unnecessary, thoughtlessly applied and sometimes distracting use of the f word, it's fairly binge worthy."
10.0,1 October 2023,"The show reminds me of the old TV ,where we had charisma, good writhing and most important really good actors. Selena Gomez really does bring some intresting youth to the trio,but withous Steve Marin and Martin Short the show wouldn't be such an interesting one. They bring that acting that we do not see anymore in the new TV shows,they give not only the appeal for drama ,but they have the fascination for classy and dashing. The show as said before brings a couple of good points together such as writhing,acting,something really important to me - new faces without thaking out the base actors. I really hope the show continuous with the same energy,love and devoution to create such an amazing content."
10.0,7 July 2022,"First season was excellent, but second is not.

Martin Short and Steve Martin are brillian, but... Selena Gomez is not a good actress, in fact she is terribly bad. And Amy Schumer? Really? She is not funny or anything.

I keep watching because story is interesting and funny and scenes are nice, and want to see what will happen next. All in all a good series."
6.0,21 October 2021,"This series is a good series, it's a funny series .

And the actors its a really Good was a good choice.

I wanna a 2 season because i like.

Congratulations."
10.0,20 October 2021,I really have enjoyed this series. The acting is perfect and the comraderie amongst the characters fun. I am so glad it is renewed for another season!
7.0,13 September 2021,One of the best shows that i ever watched. Loved it.
1.0,13 September 2021,"I couldn't get enough of the cliff hangers each episode, Steven, Martin & Selena do an incredible acting in the show. It's comedy and mystery mixed in together and I love seeing mature content coming from these characters. Selena does a great job interpreting her emotions into Mabel mora, true actors can literally bring life to characters and Selena has done it. So proud of the good reviews."
10.0,11 December 2022,"The first season was fantastic. We couldn't get enough of it. We watched it so fast. Once the second season came out, we were so excited to watch it. The second season left a lot to be desired with each episode. They turned a good portion of it into trying to push a narrative of sexuality which isn't anything this show has ever tried to do before. It was extremely disappointing to see yet another show fall into this pattern. It was so boring that I don't think we will be watching the third season. They could've done so much better. Cara Delevingne was a horrible addition to this season and it ruined a good portion of it. This was supposed to be about mystery and solving murders, and her character completely ruined it."
10.0,20 October 2021,"I've been a fan of Steve Martin's since the beginning, I saw him early on in his career when he said, ""Excuse Me"" and wore an arrow through his head. Loved him on SNL every single time he was on, Bowfinger is one of my favorite movies. I was delighted to see that he can still do physical comedy, his antics in getting to the elevator and the subsequent mayhem that ensued had me roaring. Really a fun show to watch and I can't wait to see how that awful woman died."
10.0,2 June 2022,"I think I'll start with the bad stuff first. I was really looking forward to this show for a while and then after months of waiting I finally got around to watching it and at first I was very disappointed. So I seem to be in the very minority in that I didn't mind Selena Gomez's character, her acting didn't blow me away but it was fine. Her character wasn't actively annoying like the other 2 main characters were. I get they are great actors and I used to love Steve Martin in his older movies when I was younger, but I think the characters themselves were just so unlikable, but that's just me.

But aside from that, it took me over a week to get through the first four episodes, they were just so boring and nothing happened and no meaningful progress in the plot happened aside from a few seemingly interesting cliffhangers. I almost decided to stop watching completely. A character later in the season actually referenced an earlier episode and it seems the writers were self aware of how pointless the first few episodes were: ""A whole episode with no stakes."" Except I would say it was multiple episodes.

But starting at episode 5, stuff actually starts happening and the pacing becomes much better. I won't spoil it but it starts getting some interesting reveals and the characters become slightly less full of themselves and more bearable. I don't typically like whodunit murder mysteries, but I think the differing personalities of the main trio and the intriguing premise ultimately paid off, even though it was incredibly slow to start, so I don't really blame people who quit a few episodes in."
9.0,5 September 2021,"I love Steve Martin & Martin Short, but I truly don't understand the rave reviews for this show. I could only manage to suffer thru the first episode but that will be all. It was SO BORING, not funny, I could go on! But the biggest problem is the terribly miscast, Selena Gomez. Who is NOT an actress. She literally has one expression and couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Anyone saying she's ""great"" in this, is a fangurl. Sorry, but that's just the truth. In fact, I don't know what two comic geniuses like Steve Martin & Martin Short were doing getting mixed up with her in the first place. If you want to see them back when they were funny (it's actually depressing to see how old they are now!) and life was a lot better too, watch Father of the Bride. Talk about comedy gold! This show however, is not."
10.0,5 September 2021,"I don't know what I was expecting when I watched this but I ended up loving every minute. I've not seen Steve Martin or Martin short on my screen for a long time though I am a fan of their work. Such an odd mix of actors on paper but somehow it really works! I loved the twists and turns and the nod to all the true crime junkies/armchair detectives amongst us. Every other person seems to be on a Facebook crime group these days and it made me laugh that they channeled this so well. I liked the heart behind the characters as well as the comedy element. I watched this show with my partner and teen daughter and we all enjoyed it it's not often you can watch stuff with the family anymore, we loved it and would really recommend."
9.0,6 September 2021,"What a show ,it get the viewers attention just as it starts,and i dont think any comedy ,mystery can be better than that ,these three brilliant actors have given us what we expected , truly exceptional show And the mystery of who did this will keep us guessing! What a show!!!!!"
7.0,7 September 2021,"I was honestly unsure on how I would feel about this series, but it's fantastic! It's funny and cheesy, and I love every minute of it. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez work so well together! They are the perfect balance.

I've seen a couple people complaining that Selena Gomez is coming off as monotone or rude, but have you all ever considered that this is the way the character is supposed to be portrayed? The same way that both Steve Martin and Martin Shorts are supposed to be portrayed in a specific way? I think everyone does a fantastic job with their character.

I'm also really loving everyone who they've gotten to be part of this show! I screamed with excitement when I saw Nathan Lane!

If y'all want something refreshing and something funny and with an interesting storyline, definitely watching this!"
10.0,20 September 2021,"Who knew dips could be a meal? Would you save a frozen, 3-legged cat? Who was Tim Kono? If you have ever sat around your home thinking about these things wonder no more. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez are here to answer your questions in a murder mystery 3-way called ""Only Murders in the Building"". Set in a building, ""Only Murders..."" moves from floor to floor with relative ease. (Actually, an elevator and some stairs.) Occasionally venturing out into the court yard and even the mean streets of New York. Along the way we meet other people with other lives, but the meat and potatoes is the murder in the building. So if you want to get hooked on an enjoyable series staring Steve-Martin-Short and Selena Gomez watch ""Only Murders in the Building""."
7.0,7 September 2021,"Even when she was tiny on Wizards of Waverly Place I was like this girl has serious chops and impeccable comedic timing. I'm so excited for to break the Disney chains and do real works. Unfortunately, we got Springbreakers and Behaving Badly. But look at her now. Steve Martin once again shows his stunning talent for writing and seeing him and Martin Short work together again is a real treat. Can not recommend this series enough."
5.0,31 August 2021,"Finally a great comedy show, It seems like it has been quite awhile since a truly good comedy series has been produced. The first three episodes left me wanting more, and the acting from the three leads is exceptional, their chemistry is undeniable. Short is truly a legend, and the story overall is very thrilling and funny."
10.0,20 August 2023,"I got hooked after first few episodes. Mystery Comedy and iconic characters with occasional cringey dialogues.

It follows the same old formula - lead to one suspect and new evidence appears, and turn to new suspect, and repeat.

Some twist in the end. Season 2 follows the same journey and making it so boring.

I like the characters. But the show struggles to offer something new and refreshing to keep me hooked. It also has a lot of fillers and some romance of side characters that has no relevance in the story. Howard's Romance ü§î‚ú®

I saw the ratings on Season 3 is great, I personally havent touched it. Yet."
9.0,2 November 2021,I don't know why anyone would think you would have to be paid to give this series a 10 star rating. It was fantastic. I wasn't sure about the first episode but after that I was hooked. I actually didn't figure out the killer right away and I didn't expect the ending.
10.0,6 July 2022,"The writers cannot agree on whether the folks who live in the Anconia are tenants, i.e., they pay rent to a landlord, or owners, i.e., they own their apartments and pay a monthly maintenance fee to the co-op. Thus, Bunny is Chairman of the Board (a co-op thing) but seeks to evict Martin Short (a landlord-tenant thing)."
10.0,26 August 2023,"The first 2 seasons were awesome, I was totally hooked. Very intrtreging and kept your attention through out. Waiting intensely for each next episode. Season 3...eh!!! Not so much. Episode 1 was soooooo boring, I left it numerous times to watch something else. Dredging through, I returned to continue watching it.... The 3 rd season thus far moved soo slow for anything exciting and seriously, nothing exciting ever happened. So sorry. Episode 2 and 3 offered little more excitement. I seriously doubt I will continue watching anymore of this show. Not sure what happened that it clearly went off the cliff .... Totally boring, very slow moving, no excitement at all. Sad, cause I was enjoying it. Oh well... On to another show!!!"
10.0,22 October 2021,"Ignore the long reviews from people who gave up after one episode, stick with it, sit back, and enjoy the entire masterpiece!

As soon as you think you know where the story is going, the investigation goes in an entirely different direction. Full of twists and turns, jokes and whodunnit excellence, Only Murders In The Building is truly fantastic.

Selena, Steve, and Martin may be as unlikely a trio as their characters themselves, but it really works.

Persevere at the start, it gets better, you won't be disappointed!"
10.0,23 October 2021,"Who knew that 2 aging comedians and a millennial would have great chemistry. It's witty and a great mystery caper. No spoilers, however I hate mysteries in which the culprit has two sentences the entire investigation until the last 10 minutes of the show. This is not the case."
7.0,21 September 2021,"I just finished watching the first four episodes and I'm already hooked, the chemistry between the three main leads are impeccable, it's a murder mystery in the same vain of knives out except you have three individuals who love true crime podcasts trying to solve a murder mystery in their building, the series blends comedy and murder mystery well but doesn't skimp out on the drama, as you hear the back stories of the three main leads, it makes you tear up, it has some of the best writing I've seen, can't wait for the next episode, I'm excited to know how this murder mystery plays out in the end, highly recommended for those that enjoy a well scripted whodunnit with a superb cast."
10.0,1 November 2021,Brilliant show. No faults. The three main cast members - two comedy legends and another surprisingly (to me as I hadn't seen her in anything before) great actor. Can not wait for season 2. Never even saw this advertised before watching just stumbled across it on Disney. Why was a bigger deal not made of this?
6.0,27 September 2021,"Maybe a storyline that's been done before, but everything at the same time is sooo original! The sets and fashion styling is extraordinary and just stunning. The acting fantastic, and dialog seamlessly witty. And lastly I simply love the music. Only Murders in the Building is a fun and gorgeous ride."
2.0,6 October 2021,"I just must say this show is out of this world, amazing, and a lot more.

I really really love it."
8.0,15 September 2021,"The hype about this show made me think that i was gonna watch something special but it's not, yeah it's fun and entertaining but definitely not a 10/10. The acting is bad from all the actors, they try to make the story clever but it's really not , nothing special about the direction or production , it's just a fun show that's easily forgettable ."
10.0,4 December 2021,"OMITB is a show that is well thought out in my opinion, but doesn't take itself too seriously. I like the 3 characters very much, they each have that 1 thing in common that connects them (and no, it's not just the podcasts). Their chemistry is funny, touching and dare i say homey.

I like it that it dables into the mysteries of the characters lives too, but also doesnt lose focus on the main mystery, the murder.

Some reviews might say it's too short, which i disagree. It's perfect this way imo, just as short as a podcast, and it makes u crave more and more without dragging it out for an hour.

I can't wait for the next season, that's all i'm gonna say!"
10.0,2 September 2021,"I just watch three episodes and I can say I like it. As you know, it contains comedy. This show is like the movie called pink panther. If you like pink panther you should watch this. If you like Detective show like sherlock you shouldn't watch this. Overall, it's a fun show to watch. It will entertain you in someway."
10.0,21 July 2022,"Can't we have ONE show that doesn't gratuitously interject wokism? And so many interject it in the SECOND season. We need ""trigger warnings"" if you're going to continue to do this. ENOUGH already. Too bad, because I was enjoying this otherwise innocent ""whodunnit"" series."
10.0,1 November 2021,"Being a big fan of Selena, I started watching this show, I didn't had much expectations from it but to my surprise it turned out to be awesome, the humor in many places justify the that this is not an ordinary crime drama, in some places the show gets too serious in some places to which the humor lite the seriousness, so it kind of neutralizes the show and balances both the sides, which is great to be honest. A the story plot is also kind of new, which I haven't seen in the past crime dramas. The best thing about the show is the trio of Mabel, Charles and Oliver. These characters are so well written, that makes the show more enjoyable."
9.0,1 September 2021,
7.0,2 December 2021,
10.0,26 October 2021,"It's a crime story, it's a comedy, it's a thriller. It just awesome.

All the characters are played extremely well and the tree main characters are just awesome."
6.0,14 October 2021,"An old feel, to a new show, classically scripted, heaped in mystery and fun. These types of shows are no longer made, which is the biggest tragedy.

The best thing I've seen in ages."
3.0,2 September 2021,"Binged the first 3 episodes last night and I am so excited for more of this show! They successfully poke fun at true crime nuts, police procedural dramas, and of course New Yorkers. The clues are interwoven a la Agatha Christie and Alfred Hitchcock, but the playful tone keeps the horror at bay. Shaping up to be a fun whodunnit.

My only beef.... They missed a chance to enhance the narrative in the opening credits! It shows a view of our 3 protagonists through the building windows each performing tasks specific to them... but they are in the wrong apartments üòÇ If a show is to take place in apartment hallways and elevators with little to distinguish where we are in the space, it could get confusing. During the 1st elevator scene I was literally thinking...ok per the credits she's in the penthouse, Martin short is in the middle, and Steve Martin is on the lowest floor...only to find out I'm totally wrong üòê They do a fabulous job of making the apartment interiors very distinctive which is such a blessing. It's a nitpick I know, but now 3 episodes in I still don't know where everyone isüòÇ It's also a distinction that may prove important later if say, one person passes a shady character on the stairs during a fire drill, but the others don't because they are on lower floors üòâ"
10.0,5 September 2021,"Well let me start off by saying that the show has potential to be a great. The story is intriguing and cheesy (in a good way) but the acting is pretty bad, especially from Selena Gomez. Her monotone character makes me not feel or root for her. Steve Martin and Martin Short both do a decent job but I have to note that Martin Short is carrying the show. Besides the acting, the show is filled with weird camera shots. Not sure if it's meant to make the viewer feel uncomfortable but I can assure you that I don't like it. For instance there was a scene where Steve Martin's character was talking and Selena Gomez was standing in the background looking very awkwardly. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the good stuff. First let's talk about the story. It's a classic ""who's done it"" which you can never go bad with. If you add Selena Gomez's little secret to this, it provides the show the tools to make it great. In addition, I have to say that I love the wardrobe of the characters and how effortlessly they made a simple scenes look beautiful. In conclusion, the show may seam decent, but there is something that makes me want to click that watch the next episode button. Can't wait to watch the next episode and see in which direction they drive the show!"
10.0,23 October 2021,"Great story, smart, fun, great actors! Martin kick ass:) All series are good and interesting! Very good characters and story!

Great story, smart, fun, great actors! Martin kick ass:) All series are good and interesting! Very good characters and story!"
10.0,16 October 2022,"This show is an excellent effort at updating the whodunit genre with modern sensibilities, story telling and settings.

But.... Serena Gomez is AWFUL and every time she's on screen she manages to completely take you out of the story. Her delivery is monotone and wooden. Her face doesn't move due to a lot of botox and most of the time she sounds half asleep. Imagine Lana del Ray acting and this is what you get. Seriously, she is absolutely awful and it really brings the show down.

Martin Short is brilliant at being Martin Short and he really manages to save this.

Steve Martin's character could be played by just about anyone but he still does a decent job.

The plot is nothing too amazing, it's just nice and engaging and worth a watch if you can get over the dead eyed frozen faced half asleep nihilistic hipster delivery of Gomez."
10.0,14 September 2023,"1st season was great, funny, terrific acting, just a real joy & pleasure to watch. 2nd season, good but not quite what the 1st season offered. 3rd season except for a number of the same familiar faces no more resembles the 2nd season much less the 1st than a hotdog in the bun resembles beef wellington. What is the horrid thing that is being passed off as Only Murders in the Building? The acting is stilted, there is zero feeding off of the cast between each of them. It's as if people were brought in off the street and told to read off of teleprompters. Whoever wrote season 1, please bring them BACK!"
10.0,27 October 2021,"Two screen legends doing what they do best for decades, in an atmospheric and artistic show. Selena Gomez is equally exceptional! I think season 2 will be even more marvelous! My most favorite episodes are 1 and 7. Don't expect something of a low quality, this show is like a gourmet fine wine. Not everyone is meant to recognize that. Sit back and savour it."
10.0,6 September 2021,"It's undeniable that this show came out beyond my expectations. All the cast members are performing really well, and the script and dialogue are flawless. Got a chance to finish the whole season, and I could confirm that no one will know who's murdered Tim Kono until the end of the season.

And I have to say the art direction, costume, and sound mixing are doing their jobs perfectly fine! Everything goes to the same direction to serve the story brilliantly. Another highly recommend show so far!"
7.0,24 September 2021,"I love this show. This is the best creative writing and production to come along in a long time. My only disappointment is the episodes aren't long enough. But, I love watching the episodes more than once to catch some of the details I miss the first time around. Don't miss this show!!"
8.0,1 September 2021,"It is a very good series, it has humor, it is interesting, from the first 10 minutes you can already notice that it is an excellent series, the characters are well done, you can see that the actors are really good at acting, it promises a lot and in its first 3 chapters It does not disappoint, just by seeing those 3 chapters you want to see the entire season and look forward to the second season, without a doubt it is such a good series that it is worth hiring Star + just to see Only Murders In The Building.

100% Recommended."
6.0,11 September 2021,Great show and great cast including those two blokes and that chick and a few other people.
2.0,6 September 2021,"As a fan of Steve and Martin, I couldn't wait for this. But my expectations were blown away by the writing, acting, and the great ensemble. This show (only 3 episodes in) is just fun to watch and the story pace keeps you engaged. Selena Gomez is doing a great job keeping up with the incredible talents she gets the privilege of working with."
8.0,25 December 2021,"This classy whodunnit turned out to be somewhat of a breakout hit and it's not hard to see why. Buoyed by a magnetic central trio, a strong supporting cast and bundles of twists Only Murders is an absolute hoot to watch. There are some real highs here and some genuinely innovative moments but the rampant joy of it all is slightly punctured for me by some of the heavy signposting for many of the twists and some clunky pacing. Overall though it's an impressively dignified and polished project that seems to jump from high to high. What will the fourth season bring?"
10.0,31 August 2021,"Selena Gomez is a talented singer & beautiful young lady but she isn't a very good actress, especially up against titans like Martin Short and Steve Martin. However, this is a very good show with a very good supporting cast, so it's worth watching."
9.0,16 September 2024,"Martin Short and Steve Martin make this show. The show is witty and funny. It is quite suspenseful with a few curveballs that keep you on edge. Very well written and superbly produced.

Most of the guest starts are funny and fit perfectly in - Amy Ryan, Tina Fey, Paul Rudd, Jackie Hoffman, and in particular Jane Lynch are perfect examples. However, some other guest starts, like Amy Schumer, Meryl Streep, Eva Longoria, just to name a few, are pure duds and pull the show down.

One thing that is evidently unspoken and the elephant in the room, is that Selena Gomez is boring as hell, and to start with, she needs to get some basic training in acting."
9.0,29 September 2021,
10.0,8 October 2021,"It's been a while since I've seen Steve Martin, but men, It's such a good feeling to see him back again. Funny, but with his own unique flair and style, and he's still got It. Martin Short was always a bit of the outsider that I kind of liked, but learned to appreciate more over time. He's just so weird. But in this show, It really works. Selena Gomes fits the bill as well.

And then the writing, excellent. It gives you that vibe of old crime movies, but in a very original new coat. Really a nice addition to the TV Show landscape.

It's never really tense, but the twists and turns are quite original and just entertaining. It's just a great feel good with some funny moments without overdoing It and an intriguing story. More please!"
10.0,1 September 2021,"I don't have a habit of writing reviews. It was a treat to watch a beautifully done show. Fantastic cast. It goes without saying that these performers are each fantastic in their own right, but even so, performances across the board that are are genuine, relaxed, grounded, subtle yet full, etc, is not a guarantee. This is some of the most refined work I have seen these performers do. Bravo to direction and whatever else in the show environment facilitated this.

Also, lovely writing that gently asserts a fresh step into this genre and is a fun addition to it.

Other arts in the show are very strong too; sets, costumes, props, editing, cinematography, sound, etc. Such a pleasure to experience the world that they built and the way they portrayed it.

On a personal note, as a native New Yorker who most recently lived on the Upper West Side and moved to California last year, I was grateful to see parts of my hometown and my most recent neighborhood, and so affectionately depicted.

Thanks to all who contributed for this lovely art."
7.0,2 September 2021,"I had to subscribe to Hulu to see this one and it does not disappoint! Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez are terrific. I *IDOLIZE* Steve Martin and am so glad he is dong this show. It makes me happy to watch it, which is very important to strive for these days! This show has humor with a touch of reality and surprises!"
10.0,1 September 2021,With a cast like this! Just wow! Hooked in the first few minutes!
7.0,23 October 2021,"Obviously, there are some plot holes. However, this is an all round, really good show! Super hilarious - love the chemistry between the characters, & the use of generational jokes. 10/10 would recommend."
1.0,16 October 2021,"This series is so good! Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez are a great team. The acting is superb! The whole production is brilliant. A must watch!"
10.0,23 October 2022,"Ok, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you that I didn't just binge both seasons in one weekend like I'm some cromedy crackhead. Because I totally did. This was just the right balance of predictable and unpredictable. The stories in both seasons were excellent. The cinematography - superb! The acting... ok, hold up. Who in their right mind decided to cast Selena Gomez in this?! Are you guys serious? Is that part of the joke?! Don't get me wrong - I LOVE Selena as a person but the girl has literally one facial expression and her voice does not change pitch throughout all 20 episodes. She just can't act. And that's a fact. No, I'm not a hater. I think she got the job done. But she wasn't a joy to watch, the way that it was with the older gentlemen who were such a pleasure to watch on the screen. Selena was simply... blah. Couldn't care less for her. And that made me also not care about her character either.

Anyway, go check it out. With or without Selena, it's still worth the watch."
8.0,2 September 2021,"As a true crime podcast listener this is so fun! I love seeing Martin Short and Steve Martin together again and adding Selena to the mix ... perfection.

I can't wait for the next episode!"
10.0,25 September 2021,"This show could have been great if only Selena Gomez had not been in it. Her delivery is very flat. Perhaps the producers should have considered a different female lead. Oh wait, Gomez is credited with an executive producer credit."
10.0,8 November 2021,"The writing is just terrible and makes everything seem like a Rick and Morty dialouge but still trying to keep it serious

The podcast theme just makes it less funny and whenever theres a single bit of interesting fact that you want to know about Short comes and shoves the microphone in everyone's face

Can't watch it with this terrible writing that tries to shove a joke everywhere, even with the cliff hangers at the end of each episode it's still a bore."
10.0,22 September 2021,"Only started watching it because I'm a big fan of Steve Martin, Martin Short and of course Selena.

I normally don't get into tv series. My only BUT is the language, it's gets way out of control at moments. Wish this show was family friendly."
10.0,5 October 2023,
6.0,31 August 2021,"Placing Selma Gomez sandwiched between two of funniest men in entertainment is genius. Martian and Short bring a sense of comedy to the show that is often missing in modern sitcoms. Bravo Hulu, and the remarkable case."
10.0,21 December 2021,I honestly watched the first episode and thought what a load of cr&p. I'm now on episode 7 and so invested.absolutely fantastic show in fact one of my favourite series of 2021.looking forward to season 2 so so much.
6.0,14 September 2021,"This show is charming and so much fun. Truly a joy to watch. Short and Martin keep getting better and better with every episode. And while I have heard some complaints about Gomez's 'monotone' voice... that's just what she sounds like. With that aside, she's also really good in this.

This show is different and fresh. And the setting is so engaging."
1.0,4 September 2021,"I must confess that, despite being a huge Selena fan, I tried to keep my expectations for the series not too high, because I didn't really know what to expect from the show, I had no idea how it was going to play out as I never had seen one like that before. But I admit that this strategy did not work very well. I was VERY looking forward to the premiere. Seeing her acting again in a series, and still alongside two legends, was reason enough to hold my attention. Assiduous viewer of Wizards since childhood, I already knew his gigantic talent for acting (for those who don't know it, search for Lisa's giving birth scene in Indubious Battle on YouTube - breathtaking), but despite not being surprised with the phenomenal work she does as Mabel, the character itself is a much bigger piece than I expected (and I didn't expect anything but perfection).

Oliver, Charles and Mabel are a trio who don't trust each other very much, but it's been fun to see that dynamic unfold in the first three episodes. They are very different characters, but, for some reason, they work very well even when they go wrong.

Mabel Mora is not only the most intriguing piece on the show, she really is the lifeblood of the show. Not only because she's connected to the case, but because her personality is so interesting, mysterious and, above all, relentless. Nothing escapes her gaze, she always has an easy answer for everything, making a meticulous and extremely surprising analysis seem obvious and inherent to her person, maybe because of the personal curiosity she carries about Tim. I dare say that in a line that is very similar to Sherlock Holmes.

Charles is lonely, down-to-earth, methodical, and clearly having trouble relating and bonding with others, probably because of his anxiety preventing him from being open to new things or clinging to other people and then losing them. It's what makes your forays into getting close to Mabel so interesting.

Oliver is a born creative and dreamer, who goes to great lengths to fulfill his desires or please others. He's the opposite of Charles, and maybe that's why he's the part that completes him and makes them the smartest and most curious pair of gray-haired men in New York City.

The series balances the trio in a very insightful way, separating them into different pairs each episode without us even realizing it. The dynamics between the information that the characters discover and that we, viewers, manage to perceive hidden in the scenes was composed in a phenomenal way, so that, every time I watch an episode, I come across things that I hadn't noticed at the previous time.

Only Murders In The Building is a mysterious, funny, calculating, intriguing and completely addictive series when we stick to the details. It is not a show to be watched without your attention being on it, at the same time it is a light work, which amuses and distracts us in a delicious and extremely fun way.

Tim Kono may be the victim the characters lean on to understand his death, but the protagonists' stories become another mystery to be discovered by the audience, and Mabel, without any doubt, is the character the audience is most curious to be unraveled.

I strongly recommend it!"
10.0,22 December 2021,"Overall pretty good. Not great. The biggest drawback, in my opinion, is Selena Gomez and her monotone voice. Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman."
10.0,4 September 2021,"Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin did an excellent job. It's a complete mixture of comedy and suspense. It really got me to think about what could their secrets be."
10.0,15 January 2024,"The first season was very good but the writing began to suffer in the second season although ""The Tell"" is my favorite of all episodes. The final episode of the second season was a total flop. I'm surprised the writing was so bad. They attempted to have twist after twist which ended up confusing and more importantly uninteresting. I started watching the third episode but with the mixing in of all the new characters, I lost interest. Sadly, Selena Gomez has very little acting ability and spends most of the time appearing like she has some form of affective disorder with her blank delivery and deadpan look. I know they can do better and I hope they do. So many series start out great with the writers failing to top their first season. All Creatures Great and Small has suffered the same fate."
9.0,3 October 2021,"Putting selena gomez in the cast was the worst choice they made, as an actress she is a great singer, in other words, disgusting, terrible, horrible. She can't get a sentence right without looking like a drugged robot."
10.0,20 October 2021,I thought it was great all ereformances were awesome Selena gomez acting with seasoned actors really brings her game up I thought she did great in the dead don't die. She had some really funny lines . The aestetics were incredible the sets and clothing was amazing. The mystery was solid it would be fun if it was a little more Agatha Christie style. Overall I recommend this to several people I hope others can enjoy it as much as I did. Thanks for the hard work everyone who made this happen.
10.0,1 September 2021,"I love their chemistry inside and outside the set. I think they're great actors! I love the way how Steve, Selena & Martin portrayed the friendship between two old pals and a young woman!"
7.0,5 October 2021,Can't wait for the next episode. It's getting interesting day by day!
10.0,4 September 2021,"So funny. Martin Short is absolutely hysterical. Steve Martin charmingly, subtly funny, the straight man adding to the overall humor. Selena Gomez so far keeping up as the straight, straight woman in this comedy trio. Loving it

Can't wait to finish the series. Pure enjoyment and entertainment."
6.0,24 August 2022,"Some shows are just better then they have the right to be, this is one of them. A funny and entertaining whodunit. The characters, pacing and a surprisingly great performance by Selena Gomez all come together to make this one of the best new shows in a long time. The mysteries are engaging, funny, heartwarming and sad, all at the same time.

The three unlikely wannabe podcasters placed against the backdrop of NYC is a delight. I can't wait for season three."
4.0,2 September 2021,"All the people saying this isn't a 10 star show are wrong. It's amazing! I'm already hooked 3 episodes in and I can't wait for what's to come with Oliver, Charles, Mabel and the murders in the building."
10.0,24 September 2022,"Loved the first series of this show, it was great combination of mystery, dark humour and a bit of slapstick. Steve Martin and Martin Short make a great duo. Selena Gomez is okay, she holds her own next to two seasoned pros.

I liked the idea of three random people who live in the same apartment building realising they're all into the same murder mystery podcast and then suddenly finding themselves roped into a situation that inspires them to put their detective hats on and start their very own murder mystery podcast.

It was something different. I really enjoyed watching the mystery unravel, and getting a few good laughs in the process.

The second series was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as much. I just wasn't as into the mystery of the second series compared to the first, it wasn't as polished as the first one was.

I'll give series three a shot when it comes, but I'm hoping the mystery will be more enticing and also that the comedy elements come back stronger; I didn't laugh anywhere near as much during the second series."
10.0,19 October 2021,"Just finished the first season, and I have to say I love this show. First of all, I'm a big fan of Steve Martin's writing. From his books to his stage plays he's got a certain je ne sais quoi where his writing and humor are concerned. This is right up there with Roxane, and LA Story. That brilliant quirky humor of his, and this show has his comedic finger prints all over it. That's not to discount Martin Short's contributions. These two work very well together. I've seen several of their live performances and I'm never let down. This show broke new ground in a world where entertainment is so flooded with all the same stuff done over and over and over until its all so stale. This show is a bright spot in an otherwise dull television landscape. I cannot wait for season two. In the mean time I'll have to watch this show again."
10.0,21 September 2021,"It's pretty good but for this Selena Gomez person. I don't understand her appeal. She's kind of average for her acting skills, I guess. Not good looking - not a good body - a very unattractive voice. I don't care about these things as much as Hollywood does: I care almost entirely about acting skill.

I get the weird feeling that one of her relatives sponsored this show. The writing isn't bad. It's okay but nothing special."
10.0,9 October 2021,"Brutal show. Two great comedians deserve better than this. I'd never heard of Selena Gomez before and she is just awful. Constant sulky face and monotone voice, who thought to cast her in a comedy? I watched four episodes and realized I couldn't care less about what happened."
8.0,2 September 2021,
10.0,27 September 2021,Steve Martin and Martin Short have graced us with their astonishing selves again!!!!! Selena you are doing fabulous darling keep it coming!!!! My family and I finally have something to look forward on Tuesdays!!!!
7.0,19 October 2021,This series is absolutely awesome. I Mean great. Great acting and vey entertaining. It's nice to have a show where you can sit back and just enjoy and laugh. Please RENEW !!!!!!!!!
10.0,31 August 2021,
7.0,12 September 2021,"After the first episode I was hooked. Love the dynamic between the 3 leads, it works perfectly. If you love a good crime caper I highly recommend this. Martin, Short, and Gomez are fantastic."
2.0,27 September 2021,I watched it just because Short & Martin were in it but it really is an enjoyable show. It's a good murder mystery but also funny. The language is too much and often not needed but thats the only thing wrong with it.
10.0,8 September 2021,"What a letdown! After all the hype, my expectations were so high but it just doesn't work. Steve Martin is so not on. I'm sure it is but he doesn't have characters who he can really engage with. It's just not funny!!"
10.0,11 October 2021,
10.0,27 November 2023,"I like that this show has three leads and none of them are meant to be a sex symbol. It is a fun, non-gory, whodunnit, a modern Agatha Christie. So many great character actors add to the experience.

That said, Selena Gomez's voice is jarring and immediately takes me right out of the story when she speaks. I'm not sure if the monotone, adenoidal, robotic, vocal fry is her natural voice or just her portrayal of a quirky character, but it is skin-crawling, nails on a chalkboard to me. Make it stop. It isn't quirky. It is annoying. I'm fairly certain the character isn't meant to be annoying in a non-quirky way."
10.0,10 October 2021,Every shot feels Unimportant. Selina's Mabel is absolutely uninteresting. I couldn't make it through the first episode sorry guys.
10.0,19 October 2021,I was literally hooked on the first episode. Such a good show. I love true crime so this is right up my alley. All the actors and actresses are amazing and the anticipation is everything. You never know what is going to happen. Couldn't recommend it more.
10.0,28 October 2021,"That title track, the acting, the vibes, the pace... such a great, well made series.

The background music is so enjoyable. It's perfect for the show.

Lovely to see Steve Martin and Martin Short after ages. Their best roles yet! Selena Gomez is perfect for Mabel's role. And of course it's always nice to see Tina Faye.

Can't wait for Season 2! Thanks for making such a lovely show OMITB team."
6.0,27 December 2021,"I kept seeing ads for this and thought...... and again..... and again.... Selena Gomez?......nahhh and again.... Steve Martin (anything interesting since? I can't even remember last) Martin Short? Hmmmm, same feelings finally watched it and the next episode and the next Amazing! Very short episodes, very amazing, fun fun twists!

Gomez's acting is better than I remember from that Ethan Hawke Getaway movie years back, still not great but doesn't matter because everyone else is and her performance is fine enough to be there quietly in ways among the rest.

Steve Martin does not age, wow! Maybe cause he always had white hair but he looks great."
10.0,19 October 2021,"Refreshing, funny, and gripping! True crime has to be one of the most used themes for TV shows. This show has done what many shows in the future will do. 3 true-crime podcast loving neighbours take on a case of a murder inside their building, the Arconia. The trio is unexpected, but just WORK. The atmosphere and the music set up for the show is truly something else. Simply cannot take off a star for any reason whatsoever. If there is anything I could critique, I would have asked for more content in EP8. That's about it. A must-watch for anyone who loves a detective story."
7.0,24 September 2021,"This satisfies 2 sides of you. Crime, suspense and intrigue and then the part that just wants to laugh and feel good.

Best show I've watched in a long time.

10/10 easy."
1.0,19 October 2021,"The main actors have an amazing chemistry!! Selena Gomez unexpectedly stole the series by her brilliant performance. Steve Martin and Martin Short killed it with their light hearted old comedy which combined very well with Selena. For everyone who likes murder/comedy series, THIS is the series for you. The ending was pretty good and leaves you on the edge of your seat. Can't wait for season 2!"
10.0,17 August 2022,"Season 1 was as fresh as they come. Great comedic chemistry, tongue-in-cheek fun, and a budding new star in Selena Gomez to keep company to Messrs. Short and Martin.

Season 2, unfortunately, is quite the clunker. The chemistry is gone, Selena's act turns stale, and while visuals and score are as good as ever, the writing has turned putrid. Unfortunately, we are invested and are therefore committed to finish watching this mess."
9.0,14 November 2021,"I really loved this show. The feel of the show took me back to growing up in the 80s, listening to radio whodunnits. Fun, quirky, silly, playful, not always pc, beautiful music that was arranged perfectly. The writing, the sets, the acting, the story, the journey, were all well done and I was happy to see Steve Martin again in this great show. People seem to love it or hate it and I was one that loved it for so many reasons. It didn't take itself too seriously and that's what I prefer to spend my time watching."
9.0,23 July 2022,"This show has some funny moments but, I think it is a bit overhyped. The story is very generic, something we have seen done a lot of times. Don't get me wrong - Martin and Short are good but, I don't think it's anything career changing. I enjoyed their clash and characters more in Father of the Bride.

Also, as much as I adore Selena - she can't act. I understand that her character is the more ""serious"" one and has a dry humor. But it comes off as though she is trying to sound monotone. I would like to see another actor in this role; someone who has a bit more chops."
9.0,3 September 2021,"I was looking forward to watch a what should have been great show, but seriously, it's a complete waste of time.. I don't even understand who would authorize this show to be played on Disney+.. Selena acts and looks like a dead cat, the story makes no sense at all, and in short (sorry for the spoiler) the show is about taking the elevator up and down.. So for me it's just a 1/10.. If you compare it to major shows like GOT, Walking Dead, 24, Breaking Bad.. Come on guys."
10.0,10 October 2021,Each episodes wants you to yearn for the next! I think thats the definition that it's working and having the mystery vibe.. It's like you want to share with them the journey of the mystery and gets so exited for thw next episode.
8.0,20 October 2021,"This series is the most fun I've had watching tv in a long time! I've just finished the first season and can't wait to watch the second. It's so quirky and different to any other show and the characters are written and performed so well! If you like crime shows but also like something a bit lighter this is perfect. A good murder mystery, a great friendship and beautiful New York scenery. What more could you want!?"
7.0,5 November 2021,"The series has a very powerful crime story that the different parts and puzzles of it are well matched and the viewer enjoys following it. What is very brilliant in the film is the very good acting of the actors, who are good at both the drama part and the comedy part, and they make the viewer laugh in a big way. The lovely characters of the series, which is due to the powerful script and good characterization of the series, the more the viewer communicates with the characters of the story. In general, the series is both a powerful crime and a happy and funny comedy that completely satisfies the viewer and puts the viewer waiting for the second season with its enigmatic end."
10.0,30 September 2021,"I'm 47. I'm not a Selena Gomez fan. My review is real & not fake...I absolutely adore Martin Short & Steve Martin and this show is clever, funny, lighthearted & entertaining. Just what we need during these weird times. I don't mind Selena - she does a decent job as Mabel. It's not difficult to shine when two of the funniest men alive are your co-stars. I love Oliver's old Hollywood glamour apartment that he can't afford along with the social awkwardness of Charles. Throw a young girl with no friends into the mix, add a murder and you're set. Great theme tune too. Just a wonderful show!"
6.0,9 October 2021,"Brilliant story, combining the grumpy old men with the eccentric old playwright ( reuniting Steve Martin (George) & Martin Short (Franck) in their respect for True Crime: Fresh and sarcastic intriguing Selena Gomez ( Alex Wizards) to bring different sides to this amazing comedy... I can't wait for season 2."
1.0,4 October 2023,
9.0,24 August 2022,"Martin Short and Nathan Lane are masters of their craft! As are the guest stars like Sting< Jane Lynch, Tina Fey, Shirley MacLaine. Steve Martin's a bit too mellow for me in this. His zany physical comedy is so great, I wish there was more of it. But Selena is just a terrible actress. Her words barely come out of her mouth and are so monotone. Every scene she is in, I find her annoying and it's distracting. With the right casting of the female lead, this show would have been a 9."
10.0,6 November 2021,"This show does a great job of balancing comfy, drama and mystery. The finale has such a great cliffhanger I can't wait to see what happens next. The amount of guest stars and foreshadowing is something that can't be replaced. Can't say this enough, I can't wait for the next season!"
8.0,16 December 2023,"Selena should be called Pinocchio because she seems to be made of wood except that her face is some kind of turgid soft sculpture involving Botox and facial fillers. Not that there is anything wrong with tweaks to one's face üòÇ Its just...she just doesn't belong on television! I think she would make a good dentist or dental assistant, but actor? No. I can just imagine the hilarious late night discussion between Martin and Steve where the two argue to each other against their better judgement that the ""need"" her because of her name recognition and because she adds a youth factor. I guess no actresses found the project interesting - or none with the name recognition of SG. Even she was probably about to walk out of negotiations until they promised her a producer credit. I was shocked at how much I enjoyed Steve Martin and La Short! Kudos guys!"
9.0,19 September 2021,"I feel bad for Martin Short and Steve Martin mostly because they are paired with Selena Gomez who is a terrible actress. I don't understand how her team didn't step in and get immediate help after a table read. Steve and Martin are absolute pros and carry the show. Selena is monotone and uses the F-Bomb throughout the show in really weird instances and out of context, I'm guessing to show that she is a ""mature"" actor and not a Disney kid. Overall, terrible. Just terrible."
10.0,4 October 2023,"This is such a delightful show. It actually makes me feel good after having watched it. It is so good seeing Steve Martin and Martin Short together in a well-written, funny and always engaging show. Selena Gomez is great as well, not to mention all of the wonderful cameos and guest appearances by some pretty famous celebrities like Mel Brooks, Matthew Broderick, Sting, Amy Schumer, Nathan Lane, Paul Rudd and even Meryl Streep. There is a reason why these celebrities sign up for the show. It is all due to the writing. I like how they give back stories for the residents of the building. Some of the eccentric characters are very well developed and their behavior makes sense given their backstories. This is just a good old-fashioned type of show and I have found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. The dialogue is spot on and I hope to have many more seasons of this show. I didn't know if I would like it at first after watching the first episode, but I really got into it and now it is kind of addictive and I can't wait for the next season. It definitely is deserving of all of the Emmy nominations it has received. I hope it wins something for acting with the main characters. Oh and I really love the opening theme song as well."
9.0,2 October 2021,Never saw a Steve Martin project that was bad and this proves it. Plus I gotta crush on Selena.
6.0,18 October 2021,"Selena's voice wasn't bothering me early on, but, now, by episode 6, it's really grinding by bloody gears.

She is supposed to be some sort of singer isn't she, if so, why does she talk out of her nose for chrissake.

Maybe the script is partly to blame, at this point it seems to have her doing a lot of navel-gazing & wallowing in self-pity.

But still, it's bloody annoying at the moment.

I may have to turn audio off and subtitles on, to get through this, if she keeps talking through her nose."
10.0,2 August 2022,"This a great show to watch . Twists and turns thru out . Not much of a fan of Martin but getting to like him . Selena is playing her role as a girl who lost nearly everything dear to her and slowly coming back to life , in the same building she lost everything .

I bet a few will agree Amy Schumer needs to go . She is not funny , cannot act ."
6.0,6 November 2021,"Wow the most Best movies of our legendary hero. Only murder in the building is epic, thrilling and quite suspenseful. But mostly entertaining if watch with families on Christmas eve. üéÑ"
2.0,24 August 2022,"A Finale is all you look up, but when it comes to second season we always have the expectations that can it be as good as it's previous seasons. Sometimes something's come and made you believe that it will be getting better than her pervious season that is Only murders in the building."
9.0,15 September 2021,But the acting is meh... Selena Gomez might just be the worst actor I've ever seen...I'm sorry...
10.0,13 October 2021,"Character development unfolds as a function of the protagonist(s) relationship to a murder. The singular goal of the story is told piecemeal, within a contemporary yet nostalgic nostalgic New York City setting that makes you want a trip reaaal baaad. This show is off the hook."
9.0,19 November 2021,"It's a decent show. The beginning is interesting but towards the end it starts to get frustrating because of logical errors and just being unbelievable. Acting is good except for Selena Gomez who clearly does not know how to act at all - I simply don't get why was she cast in this.

I'll probably at least try to watch the second season once it gets done, but I fear it's gonna be disappointment."
10.0,29 September 2021,"First I thought maybe 14 year olds but then there is so much swearing and crude sex comments (I got an STI sing). So then I thought maybe adult but it's so hoky! Broadway musical bits are boring and nonsensical. Bugs bunny is really a terrible addition to the script.

Could have had potential after episode 1 but went off the cliff.

I love Selena but she is so monotone it is distracting like another commenter stated.

Overall plot ends up boring and predictable.

Skip it!"
10.0,23 October 2021,"You could never get enough of Steve Martin and Martin short. With a touch of Selena Gomez this show is brilliant. Such an original idea, in an original concept. I'm only 16 minutes into the first episode and I'm hooked. I knew I would be. This is the stuff at Hollywood is missing."
10.0,6 December 2021,"Don't take it seriously. It was fun to watch. The series was well written...Hoping for a second series! Steve Martin and Martin Short, best buddies in real life, who have worked together many times, were as always, fun. Selena Gomez was good too, her dry humour matched the guys comedic wit! And the cameos were unexpected and funny! üòÄ"
6.0,28 December 2021,"First of all, Selena Gomez looks so amazing in the show. It was like watching Alex Russo's updated version with the same humour and sarcasm!

The first episode makes you think if it's worth your time or not but then you kind of get addicted with the unfolding murder mystery and comic timing of Martin Short and Steve Martin!.

Giving one more star for the background music making it a great show!

Waiting for the next season!"
10.0,25 September 2021,"Wasn't sure if this was for me.

I'm so glad I gave it a watch; it's phenomenal.

You wouldn't immediately think of Steve Martin & Selena Gomez would go together, but it works.

I'm loving all the untold backstories (especially Selena's). The title is ONLY Murders in THE Building, so, I'm hoping there will be more seasons."
6.0,1 October 2021,"I love this show. Martin, Short, and Gomez are an unlikely pair but share one thing in common; their love for true crime podcasts. They get together over a real murder in their building and try to solve the case. It's not completely different but the execution definitely is! I was hooked and rooting for them. I am really looking forward to seeing what's next."
1.0,31 October 2021,"Only finished 1.5 episodes and this is one of my all time great shows. There are few pure mystery/comedy shows on TV. If you liked knives out you will very much like this classic whodunnit with satirical elements. The characters are also extremely likeable. Selena gomez is also a standout in her breakout role, and very attractive."
10.0,2 September 2021,I love Martin and Short but the reviewers giving this a 10 need to go back and look at what these great comics have done in the past. This is not close to their best work. It is a solid 6 so I will continue to watch and hope it gets better.
10.0,4 December 2021,"Selena Gomez grounds the whole cast with her adorable snarkiness in this series. Teaming her up with Steve Martin and Martin Short was pure genius.

The backdrop of a classic building in NY is charmingly populated with interesting though fleeting supporting actors, adding to the true New Yorker vibe. The original premise of a podcast being made about the events taking place within the show makes this more than just another who-done-it. It's fun, clean, and cozy.

It takes some bold artistic risks in how it tells the tale, that I thought paid off. Giving us a glimpse of the life of others by letting you live it for an episode.

I can't wait to see what happens next season."
10.0,2 December 2021,"He best part of the show is the press interviews between the odd trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. Unfortunately, that's not part of the show itself which is surprisingly mediocre.

It's a shame because Martin Short and Steve Martin are generally can't-miss propositions and the idea of three amateur podcasters solving a murder plot involves a healthy degree of serialization.

So why is this so boring? For one, the actual murder isn't something that's particularly engaging. The idea is that one of the three members (Gomez) of this makeshift sleuthing team was a childhood friend of the murder victim but the show only commits to that angle half-heartedly.

Another problem with the show is that it feels awfully insiderish. ""Only Murders in the Building"" is set in a pretty insular Manhattan world and two of the three characters are aging showbiz archetypes. I'm on record as feeling pretty sated by sitcom characters who are in show business so this isn't drawing me any closer. The show tries to mine pathos from Martin and Short's characters as two old men looking back on their lives from the perspective of their twilights but there are character arcs are pretty predictable.

As for reasons to keep watching, Amy Ryan plays a love interest to Steve Martin and the chemistry is genuinely sweet between these two. Additionally, there's a very high probability that Steve Martin or Amy Ryan will do something funny considering that's what they've been doing for most of their lives."
10.0,16 August 2022,"The new season feels like they just phoned it in. They switched to half hour shows. Steve Martin already said this last acting gig, and you can tell he just wanted to get it over with. Selena Gomez's Debbie downer attitude makes watching her painful. Martin Short's carries the show on his shoulders, which is the only reason I'll each anymore. They really had a good thing going, but this second season is boring and has a nonsensical plot. I literally laughed out loud during season 1. They just couldn't recreate the chemistry between the characters from season 1."
10.0,24 August 2022,"This is probably the first quality show that has been oroduced in the last 5 years! Great show, great actors, original story line. Finally a show that isnt woke and doesnt bring politics into the show."
10.0,11 October 2021,"Oh this is my first review ..like ever..i loved every second og it.. the launch score, the setting , the premise, the jokes..the dialogues..the humour....

this is great... there has to be a second season..i cant get enough."
7.0,24 August 2022,"There are no flaws in this show, it's funny, clever, original and light, every time when there was a new episode I was like a child waiting for his presents on the Christmas night."
10.0,28 September 2023,"Finally something actually worth watching. Such an original idea coupled up with a great cast, great writing, great actor performances, great location.... Finally something new and so good, you can watch every episode again and again and always find something new you had not noticed before. Shall we also talk about that great and smart sense of humour, the comedy timing, the perfect casting, the brilliant direction (s) ... I just love love love this show. Favourite character: Theo. My only hope is that there won't be too many seasons cause that usually spoils the goodness of any show. But at the same time we all long for more."
6.0,12 September 2024,"I was aware of the show but didn't watch it as I thought it wasn't for me. I'm now up to series 4.1 and absolutely hooked. Brilliant scripts, Steve Martin and Martin Shirt are just nuts and Selena Gomez who I didn't know is hilarious. It's like an Adult Scooby Doo but with lots of show biz in jokes and sly references ( when Bunny was crying Martin Short says' I didn't know Bunny was a wailer = Bunny and the Wailers reference, pay attention. Great fun. Love the New York location because I've been several times and just love the city. Strongly recommend for all ages, will make great Xmas viewing."
2.0,24 August 2022,"Complete entertainment, great characters, super writIng, some real laugh out load moments. If you're looking for some light entertainment with some laughs, then watch this!! Excellent series, highly recommended."
10.0,6 July 2022,"This show reminds me of Woody Allen's Manhattan Murder Mystery. It would be a perfect 10 if it weren't for Selena Gomez. I just don't understand the casting choice. Everything else is so perfect, I can't help but wonder if her dull delivery is what the director was going for? She over articulates every word, nothing feels spontaneous, it's like I can hear her repeat her lines in her head before she speaks. Her character has depth but she is unable to portray them. Luckily Martin and Short's performances are so powerful that they make up for her cringy acting but I am so frustrated as this could have been such an amazing show! Maybe there's something I'm missing and she is right on point? That's the real mystery for me!"
10.0,9 October 2021,A fun exciting series with lots of twists! Best series I've watched in a while!

8.0,1 September 2021,"I am a fan of Selena Gomez of her show, Selena and chef. But I haven't seen her in a scripted series since her Disney wizards of Waverly place. Great show, she was amazing, every scene she was in, she mastered it. Splendid. Im a fan of crime dramas but if it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be invested into this show. Great show, refreshing, perfection."
8.0,22 September 2021,"I honestly hope that this show gets gets 2nd Season, because it's that good."
6.0,23 November 2021,"Only Murders in the Building: Season One is a Hulu series about three strangers who are obsessed about true crimes and end up working together to solve a murder mystery in their NY apartment building. Steve Martin is an out of work former actor, Martin Short is a struggling play director and Selena Gomez who is an artist who had inherited her aunt's place and also has a history with the dead person. Together they create a podcast about their findings and find themselves caught up in the murder. The story develops layers of dirt surrounding other tenants that are played by Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan and the real Sting. Tina Fey plays a popular podcaster who seeks to steal the story about from the trio along with a cameos from Jimmy Fallon and Jane Lynch. You can expect lots of funny tidbits and coverups that unravel to an entertaining series. Definitely one to watch, can't go wrong with this cast."
9.0,19 December 2021,"She definitely killed the role it was so good her character in nyc the opening lines needed some regard atleast overall it was pleasant can't wait for season 2 or ""only murderers in the building"" um some scenes definitely were not that great like the scene of imagination. But by the end of the episode their were whirls or twists. It was funny. Actually helped me give up the bingeing habit and made this habit where I should wait for an episode every week."
6.0,12 September 2021,Fun light and mysterous....went in watching ot without expectations...and really enjoying it...
4.0,26 September 2021,"Great show.. it's exactly what I needed in this pandemic world, having exhausted all decent shows to watch lol.. Interesting and funny/light. Steve Martin definitely carries the show. Eager to see who did it and I hope the show comes back for more seasons."
10.0,20 July 2022,"I don't know what direction they're headed to add it Meryl Streep for some weird odd reason she doesn't fit into the series why is she there? Selena Gomez I wish she would pick a path instead of going all over the place. This TV show will define destiny of Selena Gomez legacy why she should've stood out of this this series. I don't understand what you're trying to do now and the more they add additional cast the worse it gets one of the main regulars in it is no longer in it for some reason. Please don't mess with success by terribly adding Merrill Street you're asking for a disaster and it shows. Why did they mess with success for the first two seasons now it's turning into chaotic junk

I would have never started watch this mini series. The lesbian seen looked out of place, all picture perfect clear now see why. Her gay lover doesnt fix the plot at all. So much wondering what they were doing. All is clear now. It was put in without meaning to the story. A nice series but a terrible was to push personal Biases!? Why was Selena Gomez a co producer to start with? She have no abilities and it shows. It brought down the efforts of the 2 other stars that seems to know more what going on then Selena Gomez does. Ty read."
10.0,22 September 2021,"Selena Gomez is terribly miscast. I read she is a singer, she should stick to what she knows. Monotone voice and leaden facial expression are her major characteristics. No way she belongs here. Why?"
10.0,29 December 2022,"Refreshing different, interesting, with just the right amount of comedy. Styled with Agatha Christie plot twists and with use of some unusual film techniques borrowed from Chicago, Grand Budapest Hotel, it stays fresh. Short, and Martin have great chemistry with Selena providing a slightly flat but solid third musketeer. It works so well.

Great overall casts with a few well known cameos with a number of newer actors as well.

We totally enjoyed the episodes and often watched several in one evening.

So good it's was hard not to binge watch and we finished the first season in a week. Loved every minute of it."
9.0,21 October 2021,"The crime thriller fans, need a little patience with this series, because the real tension only builds up after a few episodes. But the series is definitely not real crime entertainment, because it is more or less comedy. What their two male protagonists play out excellently. Well worth seeing, especially for tough fans of Steve Martin and Martin Short."
10.0,3 October 2024,"Season 1 -- great. Funny, interesting, engaging...

Season 2 -- Pretty good. Not quite as funny.. but still interesting and engaging...

Season 3 -- meh.. okay.. I love Short and Martin - could do without Gomez. The writing is getting a bit repetitive and predictable. And stretching due to so many victims being killed in the same building....

Season 4 -- really a drag.. not funny, not very interesting.. STRETCHING to find something new with new characters that are more ridiculous than interesting. It's just grasping for ideas after 3 seasons. Although I've been watching season 4, it's no longer a show which I eagerly await a new episode. It's become one of those ""when there's nothing else to watch"" shows.

Without spoilers.. season 4 has one huge logic fault as well. The motive is speculated to be due to season 1 of their podcast..... but the podcast only started due to the murder... so... uhm... a preemptive motive?? Chicken or the egg?.. forgetful writers, or writers hoping viewers are forgetful, stretching to make a 4th season work. So much great talent in season four... and someone forgot to actually review the plot."
10.0,16 December 2022,"What more do you need than Steve Martin and Martin short in a comedic murder mystery genre film!! Selena Gomez holds her own but I am purely watching for the interaction and dialogue between these two amazing actors that I have grown up with and loved!! The cliff hangers are great and the cinematography is wonderful. It's fun and playful and I even came on here to see what others had said hoping no one slated it because there is absolutely no reason to!!

I have only watched season 1 and I couldn't stop watching! I'm hoping season 2 will be as good but tbh I am happy to have found this gem of a series .

Enjoy."
7.0,25 January 2022,"I'm usually not a crime series person, but the story,music and general atmosphere of the series makes you just want sit back, get cozy, grab hot coco and enjoy your self... Honestly, this series is one of the biggest hidden gems!"
10.0,9 July 2022,"Finally got around to watching ""Hulu's"" ""Only Murders in the Building"" and I must say the series was well done with acting chemistry and well written with sharp wit and one liners. Set in Manhattan at an upscale apartment building after a murder occurs three strangers in the unit Charles(Steve Martin) an ex TV star, Oliver(Martin Short) a stage director and Mabel(Selena Gomez) a young pretty twenty something meet up and start their own podcast while they investigate and look for clues! It' like a classic who did it? The suspense it brings with drama as each episode has character twist no one is whom the seem. Overall excellent work from excellent actors in Short, Martin, and Gomez a must watch series if you like comedy and dramedy that blends with real like suspense feel that's an ongoing twisty like mystery."
6.0,21 October 2021,"Feel good and fun whodunnit.

Don't take it - or yourself - too seriously. It's a warm little show to curl up to with a warm beverage and have a good time with as they unravel the 'mystery'.

Looking forward to Season 2!!"
5.0,27 September 2023,"This series has a great atmosphere, which is created by the interaction between the main characters, the setting, crazy plots and really interesting personalities.

Huge talents who really give something to their audience.

There is such and undeniabel charm, humor and sophistication, that I simply can't wait to see the next episode.

The main characters become people you feel you know, and they are joined by a cast of incredible talented people who all contribute to that particular vibe of the show.

Difficult to compare it to anything else, but the Vibe i am geeting is akin to Grand Budapest Hotel and similar movies and series with a strong narration and quirkiness.

Love it."
10.0,7 November 2021,"Just such a fun, witty, old school vibe show with great actors ( Steve, Martin and Selena are Fantastic!) With cool scenery ( NY, the apt. Building, etc) love the opening theme and song, just all around fun. My husband and I had to not binge, so we can savor the episodes. Can't wait until the next season."
9.0,2 October 2023,"First off, we really like the show. Great premise, great writing, great guest stars! Steve Martin and Martin Short as always are superior comedic actors . But, even they are clearly struggling to continue dragging the dead eyed, animatronic that is Selena Gomez. Holy crap, she is not only terrible at attempting to act, she's hard to look at, she's sucking all the oxygen out of the room through the TV! She makes Kristen Stewart look animated! I'd rather see a muppet, in her spot, at least their faces show expression. Anyway, I'm going to close this by saying - we just can't watch the show anymore as long as the third person is a corpse."
9.0,2 August 2022,
9.0,17 December 2021,"Season 1: I stumbled onto this series and I'm so glad that I did. It's incredibly funny and there is some extremely creative stuff going on here.

Very good cast. I like Steve Martin but Martin Short is just a gas here and is a blast to watch. I've never seen Selena Gomez in action and she's doing a far better job than I expected. She's a great straight woman here playing off the two old codgers' weirdness. Support cast is also very good.

I enjoyed season 1 start to finish. It's very different and I like it.

Season 2: I just finished watching the season and I have to say that the first half of season 2 has too much nonsensical ""fill"" material, it meanders a bit, and the ""smart"" humor of season 1 wasn't as good. But the second half of the season was excellent, much to my relief. I have to say that the acting in this series is absolutely spectacular. Now it will be a long wait for season 3 but I'm thoroughly looking forward to it.

Update: I just finished the last episode of Season 3. The entire season was a massive disappointment. The best thing about it was the last 30 seconds of episode 10. Acting was fine, as expected, but the writing was absolutely terrible. I read that it has been renewed for a 4th season. Let's hope that the writers get back to what worked during the first two seasons. Then I can hopefully come back and give it a higher star rating."
10.0,8 September 2021,I don't think I've ever written a review for imdb. I watch just about everything and can usually find the good in any show or movie. But these 10 star reviews are obviously false and it's upsetting because I use IMDb reviews and ratings to pick new things to watch. This show is only okay. I find the characters rather awkward and uncomfortable with each other. The story isn't that intriguing. I hope IMDb can fix these ratings.
9.0,8 March 2022,"This show is great on details in pictures and propping, first of all. It is hilarious, has good twists and merges multiple generations of viewers with the cast, which is pretty genius by having Selena Gomez sidekick Steve Martin and Martin Short, belittleing them in ""rando"" speech of her generation at times and telling them not to go on TikTok. Some jokes are a bit obvious (standing next to Sting in an elevator, what song comes up?), but overall, the journey the three of them take to pursue a murderer, manage their podcast and come to terms with their individual lives is just a joy to watch. It has inklings of Woody Allen (maybe it is just neurotic New York) in the storytelling. And it summarizes a feeling of a generation growing up with few tv shows, thus remembering those heroes, along with living next to young people and trying to stay put with them - in language, which can be learnt, and behavior, which, as we see, does not differ much. It is a triumph to and over ancient morals, and functions as the parentheses to exactly that gap many fear in modernism vs. Preserving-good-ol'-days."
7.0,21 September 2021,So excited to see the next instalment each week. Very confused about the selena gomez choice though.
9.0,27 October 2021,"I can not wait each episode. The story keeps you laughing, interested, and all while your waiting for the next episode. This is WTF entertainment is supposed to be! üôå"
6.0,20 October 2021,
3.0,1 August 2022,"This show is a breath of fresh air and I laugh out loud every episode. I never review shows, but I'm reviewing this because I want people to watch it. It's so funny and engaging. Thank you Hulu!!"
9.0,28 December 2021,"After so much wait, finally we have something fresh and binding in ""Only Murders in the building"". Its all other things than boring. Sometimes not so unpredicatable but still enjoyable. Brazzos and Ollie are the life of the show. Mabel (Gomez) too did justice to the character of an aloof, arrogant girl. I really liked the ending of every episode. Those literally begged you to click on ""next episode"" button. A rare comic murder mystery done fantastically well."
10.0,7 October 2023,"Only Murders is in exercise in frustration. There are so many aspects of it that SHOULD produce really outstanding content, and yet...it's watchable. I'm still watching 3 seasons later...but this show is like an engine with a timing problem. It's never quite maximizing itself.

The first, and biggest problem is the writing. The murder mysteries generally aren't that well done. You as the viewer are not presented the information you need to 'play along' and try to figure the mystery out for yourself. Which is part of the fun of mysteries, ESPECIALLY multi-episode mysteries where you have time to speculate and talk with friends. Critical information is withheld until the final episode.

The second problem is the comedy. For a show with Steve Martin, and Martin Short as regulars and with guests like Tina Fey and Paul Rudd, you'd expect the comedy to take a front seat...but it really doesn't. The comedy is pretty tame in terms of how funny it is, yet the characters often are very over the top.

Let's talk acting. You will see both spectacularly good acting and spectacularly bad acting on this show...sometimes in the same damn scene. The worst offender is Selena Gomez. This was my first exposure to her, and my god...she's terrible! This woman CANNOT act. Not even a little. She drags down every scene she is. She's often given the wittiest lines...and her timing is dreadful and the jokes don't land. It's honestly painful to watch.

Steve Martin is solid throughout. But seldom spectacular. Martin Short starts out VERY schticky playing an over the top broadway producer, and I found him repellent. But the good news is that he tones it down over time. And as he does a surprisingly good actor emerges from that. Short plays so many of his character loud and big that I was surprised to get quality acting from him.

The guest stars are hit and miss. Nathan Lane and Meryl Streep were the best by far. Streep is Streep. Lane has never been a favorite of mine. Like Short, everything I've seen him do he played so big. But this was excellent.

But some of the others I thought were pretty forgettable. Tina Fey was solid in her role, but nothing memorable. Paul Rudd was supposed to be annoying as the victim in season 3, and he was annoying. But not in a way that was fun or interesting. Matthew Broderick shows up for 20 seconds to play a bizarro version of himself that was basically one gag...and not particularly well executed.

Now, one of the things the show does really well is red herrings. Every season is just a shotgun of red herrings that feel like almost every side character has motive, means, and opportunity. But after a season or two of seeing that the show is REALLY going to withhold critical information until the end, it actually becomes quite easy to ELIMINATE suspects anytime they actually seem to have strong motives. This wasn't as bad with season 1 (the best mystery), but it very much was with seasons 2 and 3 and is something I wish the show would avoid in future seasons. I really hope they start 'playing fair' and presenting the audience with the information they need to solve the mystery and form reasonable hypotheses.

I'm sure it's not possible to replace Selena Gomez at this point...but MAN, nothing would improve this show more than de-emphasizing, or flat out recasting that character. She's really dragging the show down. Martin and Martin bring so much energy to their scenes and then her line arrives and it's just ... recited in the lowest energy way possible. I could get more personality out of an AI bot reading her lines.

Anyway. Overall a solid show...but uneven as heck."
10.0,20 October 2021,"This was truly funny, and silly, i thought it was done well, didnt really like Selena, I think she talks weird, but the dynamic between the 3 main characters was great, I laughed alot, the Sting thing was hilarious."
10.0,11 July 2022,"This series is superb.. The locations, the building, the decorations are impeccable. Martin Short and Steve Martin are veteran actors, I am just having euphoria as I am watching them - they are just delivering the outstanding performance that they delivered for decades. Supporting actors are all veteran theatre actors. They are just delivering a craft as well - just masters of their work. But why on earth Selena Gomez?? Whose idea was it to select her for this role. A robotic fridge would deliver the same cold, inhuman performance as well. I would vote it 9 if it was not Selena Gomez in that role. She is such a performance killer. She is so poisonous. She is just killing every scene she is in. Such a terrible performance.."
10.0,15 September 2021,"Steve Martin and Martin Short were amazing to watch but Selena's performance left a bit a bit too stilted, overall plot was good but some of the actors came off wrong."
8.0,3 September 2021,"It seems I am the among the minority of people who think this series really sucks, script is tired and old. Acting of the two guys is over the top and you don't know why Gomez is casted in this series. You really want to watch a murder mystery in a Manhattan apartment watch Woody Allen's "" Manhattan Murder Mystery"". I wonder where are the 10s are coming from !! It's hard to finish even one episode."
6.0,16 October 2021,"A very smart & funny show. Great actors and acting where all compliment each other so well. You will Love the ""old guys"" still on their game! You will enjoy this way more than you'd ever imagine. Especially if of a certain age range. Lots of good chuckles from ""the old days"" especially in season 1. Now that we're three seasons in, it's clear that Martin Short is the one holding it all together- he's the strongest, the funniest & cutest cast member by far. I love all the cameos, they work so well! In season three that would be Meryl Streep. I wish they would either completely avoid the political advertisement commercials- which may be a HULU thing and not an OMITB thing- OR advertise for all sides (candidates) because the flat out lying JoeBiden Ads are more than I care to deal with when watching such a good show as this one is."
10.0,16 September 2021,A real gem. A feel good murder mystery done excellently. Martin Short and Steve Martin are just amazing in it. Great writing too.
7.0,19 October 2021,"So I've waited till the end to give my review and belive me it wasn't easy.

I wanted to after every episode just spoil it but no I waited why beacuse this show is beyond interesting filled with wit humor murder and intelligence unlike any show has presented in a long time steller cast gives seller performances but Steve you have truly aged well and not since the ending of planes trains and automobiles have you touched me in a way that says More please. Cannot wait for the next season.

For thoes on the fence just do it its a adult show for adults and it's down right perfect enjoy yall."
5.0,27 August 2023,"To be totally honest, the writers of this show of such thoughtful attention to detail, they know their characters, voices so well, that everything in it works. Even when I am feeling like some plot point or character, quirk might not come together, the writers figure out a way to have, it work organically. Steve Martin and Martin short, after all these years, still have it. Martin short seems right at home in this role and provides the most laughs for me personally. Selena Gomez is also killing it throughout the show. She represents generation Z quite well, but also has , a wink and nod to some of the funnier aspects. I really enjoy the interplay between her and the ""olds"" as she calls them. Well worth your time!"
8.0,19 October 2021,"Hell of a show ! Perfect amount of mystery, perfect amount of comedy, and even perfect length of episodes which I like. This series introduced me to the legendary Steve Martin and Martin Short. Also, the title sequence and score is just plain awesome!"
8.0,24 November 2021,"This was a funny little murder mystery with plenty of red herrings. Acting was superb and production excellent. It is funny that the best joke in series is saved for last, well the last episode. Well done, looking forward to the next season."
9.0,11 September 2021,"First of all, this show has amazing production. It is really nice to see the vintage-looking building and interestingly decorated New York apartments and basically every shot looks like it was very well thought out.

Secondly, Steve Martin and Martin Short are pure joy to watch. At first, Short strikes as the most entertaining character - an optimistic ageing bohemian director who faced a series of failures but have not lost hope of directing his 'next big thing'. And later on Steve Martin's character develops in such a way that allows him to showcase some of his best work, playing a neurotic and self-conscious but gentle, kind and at times hilariously confident actor. At some point he stole the show from Short for me since his character is so interesting to watch.

As for Selena Gomez - she is OK. A tell-it-like-it-is 'modern' girl with not much of a background story. Lacking personality, but that it is 100% screenplayers' fault, not Selena's.

And here is what the show's problem is: the screenplay is not more than 5 out of 10. It is kind of slow paced, characters lack motives for some of their actions, there are very few background details and because of this you may wonder every now and then, how come this is a murder story but I feel no sympathy to the main plot whatsoever and do not even care who the 'murderer' is. You surely get involved when Short and Martin steal the scene but other times, the show feels just boring.

Add some bright sparkly dialogue to it (maybe I am being obvious but the whole thing would become alive if some Woody Allen-like kind of conversations were there), give the main female character more background story and actual words to speak, add some interesting secondary characters to fill the 'building' with life - and it would have been a 10 out of 10. Currently, by episode 4 it still feels empty - I would call it 'Only Steve Martin and Martin Short in the building' because I haven't noticed anything else."
8.0,1 September 2021,
10.0,12 September 2021,"Steve Martin is really the only good actor on the show. All the other characters have a flat monotone performance and the timing for jokes just seems off. I liked the chemistry between the characters, but the strange acting was unexpected being that the cast is well known.

That being said, I really enjoy the plot for the show as it's a unique take of a whodunnit. It's all very quickly and at times cartoonish, but I've been enjoying the mystery the whole time.

(Side note: It seems that the reviews are being bombarded with Selena fans. The 10 star reviews are a bit over the top haha.)"
10.0,5 September 2023,"I loved Season 1, Sting as himself, as a murder suspect. STEVE & Marty with a gal pal. What could be better.

Once well respected 70 somethings, Director Marty, and Steve Actor once famous for a popular Police Detective show, with neighbor young vivacious Selma. Marty decides to do a true crime podcast, Only Murders in the Building, to revive his career.

Season 2. Still loved it. A 2nd murder in the building.

So excited, yes really, for Season 3. Some of it eally misses for me Maybe, I'd rather re-watch season 1&2.

Steve & Matry play off each other. The situations are funny, but than there are one liner gems. Smart & funny.

The 5star is bec I loved season 1&2. And #3 was just disappointing."
7.0,25 October 2022,"Such a fun show! Steve Martin and Martin Short are amazing! They are comedians that shine now just as much as they always have. Clever story with great execution. Wonderful writing sets this show apart. They are gems and their legendary status is well-deserved. Nathan Lane also brings his genius as a guest star. His contribution to the show is a huge bonus. What a great cast, well, except for one. Unfortunately Selena Gomez is terrible. Worse than terrible! Horrible actually. She almost makes the show unwatchable. How can her acting be so bad? I still watch for the guys, but my gosh, she brings it down."
8.0,9 August 2022,"Why all the Selena Gomez haters?

Haven't any of you heard of the straight man role in comedy?? That's exactly what she is. With two comedic geniuses (Martin and Short) in tow, there needs to be a grounded leg in the trio. That's Gomez. She's perfect. She's moody and snarky, a typical young Manhattanite.

If you haven't seen OMITB yet, Ignore the haters - The chemistry between the 3 leads is great and very entertaining. It's a fun whodunit. Enjoy!"
6.0,3 September 2021,"I like it A LOT. I mean like a whole lot and stuff because this has to be a certain length. So, there ya go."
3.0,9 September 2021,"It's really an incredible show, it's nice to see Selena Gomez acting again...awesome cast and a rlly intriguing plot."
10.0,21 September 2022,"This show is funny, witty, entertaining and captivating. It has a great cast and really good script. It is a great example how you can make a great show with modest budget and great talent. It takes only good writing and acting. Take that marvel, netflix, Amazon... Yay for Steve Martin and Martin Short - legends!

Every episode is funnier than the next and the cast is incredible. Thank goodness good shows like this are being made again!

The plot twists and turns keep you on your toes and the Easter eggs are not in short supply. So many meta comments about the show are embedded in the dialogue, it's also hilarious to have lots of jokes about intergenerational miscommunication and popular culture."
10.0,10 September 2021,"One episode and I'm hooked! While I typically find Selena Gomez acting one dimensional...In this show her style fits as a nice balance for ""the Martin's."" Intriguing, with enough lighthearted humor. Wonderfully written, shot and edited. It's funny because people don't trust a 10 star review; the negative nellies can say what they will...this show is top notch."
10.0,9 September 2021,Enjoyed the story and actors. Why the constant f-bombs? So unnecessary.
8.0,9 September 2021,"Okay, I was slow to get on board and slogged my way through episodes 2 and 3, but I've got to say, episode 4 got me in. Backstories revealed, Charlie redeeming his insecurities, the plot twist, and Sting. Can't wait to see how this finishes up."
9.0,7 September 2021,Would have made this series a much better one. It would have also been a bit more watchable had the role of Gomez been don by a better actress.
9.0,29 October 2021,"I watched the show because of the 8.2 rating, and because I'm a Steve Martin/Martin Short fan and I don't mind looking at Selena Gomez.

But what a disappointment. They must have swept their entire circle of friends to get such ratings. It is terribly, embarrassingly, unfunny. I cringed my way through two episodes, but I just can't manage any more."
7.0,15 September 2021,"I love, love this series. It's fresh and new. The chemistry between Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez is so fun to watch. I honestly haven't been so excited to watch a show in a while. It's something that my Boomer Dad, my GenX self and my GenZ daughter can all watch together. That is a rare find. I hope there is a second season. My only problem is having to wait for a new episode to drop each week. Such a gem of a series."
10.0,9 September 2021,"When I saw the IG ad for this, I knew I would have to watch this. Steve Martin and Martin Short have always been some of my favorite comedic actors and the combination of them two along with Selena Gomez is so adorable. I absolutely love the show! It is so intriguing and funny. I seriously haven't laughed out loud this much in a long time. Besides the language (a little too much on the profanity for my taste) I am hooked. I also love Amy Ryan. She is such a likable actress. I was happy to see her role in this as well as Tina Fey's character. The show has so many great characters (all the building tenants) with so many funny scenes. It's my new favorite and I recommend it. I believe this show is a hit!"
6.0,28 September 2021,"The writing in this show is incredible. Not only does it play off the different personalities of the characters but it realistically and comedically captures the forming friendship of neighbours who are essentially strangers but are closer than they know. Steve Martin, Selena Gomez and Martin Short are brilliant and both bring you to tears and laughter. The shorter episode length keeps you on your toes but keeps it refreshing and exciting. Brilliantly funny ""who dunnit"" mystery!"
5.0,25 October 2021,"Great combo of comedy and mystery. Got some really funny laugh out load scenes ( scrabble game )....starts off slowly but as the episodes are short,it's easy to binge and enjoy. Although not a huge fan of either comedians, I really enjoyed this light hearted show and am looking forward to the next one!"
9.0,8 November 2021,Martin Short and Steve Martin make a brilliant team. I'm not a fan of Selena Gomez but she completed the other characters well. An enjoyable whodunnit.
10.0,14 September 2023,"Let me tell you something: it's been a long time since a series or a movie got me so hooked!

Everything seems so done before and so unmemorable the past years. OMITB is so refreshing! Interesting plot, humour, good pace, good acting and chemistry.

Is everything perfect? Of course not. Does it matter? Hell no! Everything works so well together, that you get swooped in without realizing.

Even Selena Gomez is better than I was expecting. You would think that it would be an issue for her to actually connect with Steve Martin and Martin Short, but they actually click!

The bottom line is that this is an upbeat, spunky murder mystery that doesn't weigh you down and keeps you wanting more."
10.0,19 October 2021,"Only murders asks a lot from the audience because none of the plot is plausible and so to enjoy it you need to be willing to accept the invitation to go along for the zany ride. Often it is explicitly meta when it breaks the fourth wall and subverts genre expectations, but sometimes it seems to slip back into a conventional show so is a little confused here. But if you do accept the invitation then you are rewarded for the investment with some really enjoyable chemistry between the 3 mains, some one liners and gags which make you laugh out loud, and a nice reminder of the joy of not taking things to seriously and a murder mystery entertainment for its own sake. Short and sweet 30 min episode are welcome for such a show and make it easy to watch them either here and there or all in one go without much effort."
10.0,4 November 2021,Steve Martin is perfection in this (especially in the last episode).. I laughed so much. All the famous people who kept popping up was a brilliant touch. Dont miss this one. Just loved it üòπü§£üòÜ
8.0,19 October 2021,"Very Disappointed by the End of this Series and am amazed they are going to try to stretch this out into another Season. One Season was enough and instead of trying to milk this for all it's worth, could have ended on a High Note.

It was an interesting collection of people and for 10 thirty minute episodes, it was fine. It certainly was not something worth repeating or seeing again. The writing was not very good and the cast has really worn out its welcome. Season Two will probably be a ratings disaster (even for Hulu)."
10.0,26 June 2022,
6.0,2 November 2021,"Its too awesome, funny, thrilling. Great directory, great way to visualize everything, too good supporting actors.. main casts are terrific. In a good a full entertainment pack."
10.0,19 October 2021,"Unlike anything else on at the moment this unique show stands out with a great cast, smart comedy and quality writing offering an immersive feel bringing fun and current stories to each episode."
6.0,8 November 2023,"I started watching only murders in the building after seeing a trailer for it and at first I was a bit doubtful but as the season progressed and I got to see and learn more of each character and their traits I fell in love with it. The build up to the climaxes are so enjoyable, it really leaves you wondering who-dunnit?

Its a refreshing take on murder mysteries and I love the cast, they gel well together and honestly without Mabel and her guys the show would not be what it is. It is funny, thrilling and full of drama which I absolutely love. I binged all 3 seasons and cannot wait for a 4th season. What i really liked it that it was not predictable, there were many characters who could have been the murderer and so that was quite nice. Even if there are 10 more seasons but they keep the writing and storylines just as great, I will keep watching."
5.0,11 October 2021,"Edit: just finished season two, just gets better and better!!!!! I wrote earlier review before I finished season one. This is a high-quality show with fantastic set, lighting and wallpaperü§£. It's extremely well written & acted, the music is great & it always keeps me guessing. It doesn't help that two of my favourite actors are the leads. Bravo! It is not a show for kids it does not have a children's rating it's for older teens and up so if anyone's upset about that they just didn't do their due diligence when it came to the rating. My new favourite show!"
10.0,17 August 2022,"Amazing cast, great scenes, intriguing and well directed! The comedy is awesomeness very smooth, Only Murders in the Building is easy to binge. The 3 main leads are exceptional I see why it was nominated. I thought I was gonna hate the series but it's quite good, I'd tell anyone to give it a chance even if it doesn't win much it's fun!"
10.0,21 October 2021,"This one of the best refreshing series. I enjoy it very much. All thing in this series are so organized.

Story, Acting, Music , Comedy, Casting are perfectly done.

I recommend to it everyone to watch and enjoy. Thanks to all for creating this series.

Looking forward for more refreshment in season 2........"
9.0,23 September 2021,Great concept. The writing and directing works well. Though the constant cursing does nothing but damage the dialogue. Writers: go with lighter slang language and throw out the real trashy expletives. Yeah a lot of people curse in real life however constant swearing is never cool and adds zero.
10.0,16 October 2021,"Completely devoid of any psycho political nonsense, classic faces being funny constantly, what a breath of fresh air!

I'm halfway through the series now, and have enjoyed every episode.

I'm a tiny bit sad this is missing the Third Amigo, I would have cried tears of joy, I'm not joking, to see all three in same film(tv show) side by side. Chevy Chase, and everyone else, please figure out how to get along with each other again.

Don't get me wrong though, Selena Gomez is great as part of the trio, nothing against her, just my ageism showing through."
10.0,1 September 2021,"All is said.

The boys are doing a great job, but not chemistry with Gomez. Stop casting her. She's no actress."
10.0,2 August 2022,"I'll admit, I watched the first season but after the hype surrounding the show. I'm baffled as to why it's got such a high rating. The writing is cringe, Selena is monotone and subpar, and the over the top dramatics is almost too much. It feels like a caricature. The jokes hit only half the time, and sometimes the music is corny. Honestly, the whole podcast thing seems rather overused, and some of the supporting actors are too much dramatic as well. It's an average, mind-numbing show at best. Definitely not Steve Martin's best. Short's character is a hard pill to swallow. I would like Mable if the character was casted better. She needs more animation. Maybe she could borrow from Short's over the top schematics to compensate. There are better things on television. This one doesn't quite fit into a true mystery or true comedy. It doesn't know what it should be, but it just doesn't work."
6.0,19 October 2021,"This show was an unexpected delight with a cast I came to love & a story that had me excited for each new episode. :) I was a fan almost immediately.

What I loved most about this quirky out of the box mystery solving series was the widespread appeal to various generations. I watched this show weekly with my sister (who's in high school), my grandparents (77 & 80) then me (28). It's something that brought us together & each of us got a laugh. We made a ritual of watching as the new episode dropped at midnight! So excited for season 2.

Definitely give this show a fair shake! It's clever on so many levels & I hope we will see more like it! Highly recommend."
9.0,2 September 2021,I absolutely loved the characters and the show especially Steve. The screening and storyline is awesome! Worth every second!
6.0,26 October 2021,"Apparently this was a vague idea that Steve Martin had for a while after he went to a function and saw several old show biz people together. He thought what about getting them to solve crime.

Roll forward and we have a show where we waited for each episode to drop.

The story is character driven. It gives us a slice of a particular strata of New York. They are not poor (mostly) and occupy an island of privilege. But they are fascinating to watch. The side stories are often rib crackingly funny. Yet there is empathy for even the most selfish antics of Martin Short.

This is a painting of New York as we want it to be."
2.0,1 September 2021,"Hooked up after the first episode, great comedy and great characters, all dipped in a proper mistery plot... awesome!"
10.0,3 September 2021,As said this show is simply amazing. This is reflected in the overall public review and professional critic. The dynamic between the three main actors is simply perfect. Selena's role and acting is what mostly gives life to the series and what makes it stand as one of the best series of the year. She reaches the level of her two legendary comedic co-stars with ease and as executive producer she again has shown that she simply is one of the most talented people that the industry has ever seen. I recommend it 100%.
8.0,1 September 2021,So funny and mysterious! Very entertaining...my husband and I were glued to it!
9.0,23 September 2021,
10.0,11 December 2021,"Don't know why more people are not watching it or talking about it - everyone should.

Such a good combination of humour and mystery with two most compatible and talanted amigos.

Storyline, script, direction, acting all combined makes it worth spending every second on.

Already waiting and excited for second seaaon.

Oh! And to add, most bad reviewers saying Selena fans giving it higer ratings is a myth or one sided opinion coz I am not her fan, did not even particularly like her acting skills in this one but other two polished actors along with ride in the storyline, cover up the kinks in acting skills of novices and so the team together works to bring the entertainment value of the show."
9.0,28 July 2022,"Please, do not confuse stellar cast for inane writing. Trying to be too cute makes it excruciatingly difficult to overlook the pain the actors feel in delivering their lines. AND, that horrible noise playing while the deaf kid is on is actually WORSE than the third man theme..."
9.0,20 September 2021,"I always liked Steve Martin and Martin Short, but his show is dire. Selena Gomez sounds exactly like the robovoice on my Roku. She has no acting talent at all. No wonder Hollywood is importing British actors to play Americans.

The plot is senseless, the lighting is terrible, the direction is disastrous. It makes me wonder if the actors could feel how terribly *off* this show is when they were making it. On top of that, Hulu has taken over the reviews here and seems to own the subreddit on this show because every person I know IRL can't figure out how they managed to make such a terrible series, but everything online is an exclamation point! 10 star review! Praising Selena Gomez's fantastic acting! And demanding multiple Emmy nominations!

It's like the entertainment industry is now TASS in the old Soviet Union, dictating reality.

It's supposed to be a funny & kooky fantasy but it's senseless, lifeless, creepy & dreadfully unpleasant. Hollywood has made so many.motion capture movies that actors and environments now have an unreal quality that attempts to convey reality, but fails."
7.0,29 October 2021,"This is a delight the characters are well rounded and it's an intelligent but cheesy premise, Its not laugh a minute but it's not written that way Each episode is short and rattles along at a decent pace, it's well worth investing a little bit of time."
9.0,23 August 2022,"This show is a pleasure to watch due to the mood, setting, and characters/actors. Steve Martin and Martin Short work great together. Highly recommend it.

So, the positives out of the way, the biggest negative for me is the formula they are using. It's essentially an intro episode then 8 episodes of leading viewers to suspect it's someone it's not, then in the last episode it's someone where there is almost nothing linking them to it in the previous 9 episodes. Season 2 was even worse in that they didn't explain at the end how the killer was connected to many of the clues and how it fully played out. You can essentially watch the first and last episode and have just as many clues linking the actual killer as someone who watches every episode.

Another issue is the Mabel character is almost always the same monotone and humorless mood/persona. Oliver (Martin Short) and Charles (Steve Martin) are great though as are most of the other regular characters on the show."
6.0,17 November 2021,"Heard the buzz and to began to watch; liked the story, Selena Gomez was surprisingly marvelous, Steve Martin good but Martin Short was exceptional. Short's character is the glue that holds the show together. Short was hilarious!"
3.0,19 December 2021,"I really like this show at first i didn't understand the hype but once i gave it a watch i was hooked to it. I can't wait for season two, i'm looking forward to see how season 2 plays out with the cliffhanger the final episode had."
9.0,22 December 2021,"Only murders in the building

A splendid whodunnit story that's brought to life by its brilliant casting. Twists and turns are littered all through, making it worth every minute; the 7th episode is especially well-done with the unique styling.

Absolutely deserving of the praise and accolades it's been garnering thus far (if only Selena Gomez had snag the golden globes best comedy actress nom, but we have the critics' choice and possibly the Emmys to look forward to.)"
10.0,22 October 2021,"I personally loved this show from beginning to end. Everyone did great in this series. It's funny, intriguing, and really pulls you in to where you're invested in the all the characters and the world. Overall just a nice, really well done comedy/mystery show."
9.0,20 October 2021,"Always enjoy Martin and Short. The writing here leaves something to be desired, and those critical of Gomez's acting aren't off base. It doesn't matter though as it's all just light fun. The best part was the exchanges between the two leads. Have a question: who put the ""I'm watching you,"" sign on Amy Ryan's door? It does end on a terrific note. A second season apparently is in the offing. I suggest they lose the Gomez character. She adds nothing of interest."
8.0,28 September 2021,
9.0,31 December 2023,"Started watching with the family and binged six episodes the first day as the show is well written, and directed. The acting by Steve Martin, Selena Gomez and Martin Short is fantastic. The storyline just sucks you in and keeps you wanting to know what's next or around the corner. The main issue I have with this series and the reason I rated it just a six out of ten is due to all the added profanity. The language feels forced and is just too over the top. I can easily see the script being written where the fowl language is dialed back. I'm going to keep watching as I enjoy this series very much and would easily give it a ten if not for the profanity."
10.0,1 July 2024,"As much as I love Steve Martin and Martin Short, two great comedians, and as much as I was looking forward to this show, after a few episodes I pulled the plug. The plot is contrived, unbelievable, and silly. I could almost overlook that just because I really like those guys, but Selena Gomez was the deal breaker. Not only is she an untalented actress, her nasal monotone and bland delivery was just too much to bear. I cringed every time she said anything. Sorry to say I just couldn't continue watching. I wish Steve and Martin all the best, but this show just doesn't cut it. I hope they try something different, their talents are wasted in this show."
6.0,25 October 2021,"I was a little shocked to see Selena as a main cast. Didn't expect a huge performance from her and maybe that's why, I like what I got.

Steve and Short are just perfect for the role and they basically carried the whole show and to some extent Selena too.

So, trio is good and then comes the writing part.

Writing was the backbone of the show and how they used meta dialogues are just crazy.

The music is a bonus because if I like the opening theme, there is strong chance that I will like the show too.

The pacing of the show is really good. I didn't get a lowbar in the show.

The mystery are good but not so shocking.

But I like how the keep bringing twist after twist.

Overall, it's a good watch."
10.0,24 September 2023,"I avoided this show until Season 2 was out.

I figured it's just another Disney+ show trying to capitalize on the SM & MS's legacy, with SG thrown in for the young audience.

I was honestly surprised by how funny the writing easy, and engrossed by the whole mystery. It's clear that the trio actors are having a blast doing the show!

The intergenerational friendship dimension is rather touching and very welcome, especially their shared concern that they haven't lived up to their potential.

Season 3 is stream of Hollywood's who's-who that, at first, threatens to reduce the season to a string of cameos; BUT this season packs a lot more genuine emotions (curtesy of Meryl Streep).

This is honestly one of the best written shows around, and as someone who's a fan of SM and MS, this easily ranks among their best work for me."
6.0,15 October 2021,"Some fans Say that All who rated this 10 Who is Selena Gomez fans but let's See the greater Sides of this show

I mean you just need you all to See how Incredible the Cinematography or how the Soundtracks is to well or Acting From All Actors Especially Martin Short Who is Doing Great Mix Between Mr Bean Comedy With Dialouge Comedy and Finally The Story telling With every ep Thats telling The investigation With Different Ways You don't Excpect it .

Selena Is To well in this Show And I find her Very likeble For A darktone .

Just Relax Hulu Did Great Job you need To See if you Want To cancel this From your Watching List .

Give it A Chance , its Worth your time."
1.0,4 September 2022,"This is way better than you would think it is. The plot - which is the most important thing - is good (not Agatha Christie good, but good).

Steve Martin (always the most tolerable of the look-at-me I'm funny North American funny people), is really good, because he is not playing it for laughs. Martin Short is obviously irritating, and obviously not a good actor, but I think that is the point of Martin Short. Selena Gomez is good; I like her.

The supporting cast are great, as are the sets, and the rest of it.

Except Cara Delevingne. She is, literally, the opposite of acting. Personally I do not find her attractive. But, apparently, there are enough that do. So please find her modelling work, please tell her that she is beautiful and does not need to act. Please. Her appearances have gained enough attention that she is on Graham Norton. That is too far. Please stop Cara Delevingne.

Please."
9.0,10 November 2021,"I really wonder why it took Steve Martin and Martin Short so long until they play alongside each other in a major production again. OMITB is full of hilarious dialogue, colourful characters, and great comedy acting. I was intrigued from start to finish.

There were a few minor grievances, and a rather big one. Some story scenes were handled a bit clumsily, especially when it came to reveals and resolutions. The one constant and big complaint I have is Selena Gomez. I am stunned how bad her acting was in this. Everytime she had to walk, she walked very awkwardly. Her lines were wooden, as if she had just read them for the first time. After ten episodes, we have barely learned any interesting character traits. It was almost mid-school level bad.

I have never seen any other work she has done. But I am sure this can't be the same Selena Gomez who is a popular, likeable actress. I hope she gets better in the next season!"
8.0,24 August 2022,"I knew from the first episode I would enjoy this, Steve Martin and Martin Short together is a fantastic pair up. I'm always weary of whodunit shows or films, pretty much al the same containing a twist in that it wasn't who you were made to believe it was. This Programme though has been made so well I feel it contains enough humour, and likeable characters to detract from the norm and make it a show you cant wait to see the next episode of.

Martin Short's ditzy behaviour doesn't get annoying, it's genius! The chemistry between all three stars really does work, the screen time for each is well balanced, meaning you don't get too much of a good thing all in one go and the spend the next 20 minutes twiddling your thumbs, great job!

I can appreciate this show may not be for everyone, but its certainly one of the best light hearted easy going shows to be found in 2022. Cant wait for S03."

8.0,31 July 2022,"Only Murders in the Building is an ingeniously crafted murder mystery with an impeccable script. The comedy shines through the lead actors Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez. On paper, pairing Steve Martin and Martin Short with Selena Gomez might seem weird, but works brilliantly. Their chemistry is palpable from the start, and the camaraderie between their characters makes this worth watching from the get-go. Martin Short oozes with charisma and his wit and zeal as Oliver Putnam might give him an Emmy win. If there is an Emmy category for best trio, then Only Murders in the Building would take the top spot. What I admire the most is its capacity to seamlessly mesh individual plot lines together, and the ability to give the audience little nuggets of what's to come in each episode. The series manages to foreshadow the outcome and the eventual reveal in a sleek and bold manner. The storyboarding of the opening credits sequence and the overture intertwined with it pulls the viewer into the storyworld and entices them to keep watching. Whoever skips the opening credits sequence is not a true fan of the true crime podcast. Each episode is filled with an abundance of twists and turns. Every episode is immaculately crafted, high stakes driven, and offers the perfect blend of humor and mystery. Only Murders in the Building is one of the best comedies I have ever seen. Each episode leaves you wanting more. It keeps the viewer engaged and in a positive and upbeat mood. Plus, it is extremely addictive.

Final verdict: 10/10."
10.0,3 September 2021,"It was not what I sincerely expected, it was a bit disappointing so I decided not to finish it, maybe I will at some point but I don't think so."
8.0,19 April 2023,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is a new comedic mystery series on Hulu that has gained a lot of attention, thanks in large part to its star-studded cast. The show follows three neighbors in a New York City apartment building who bond over their love of true crime podcasts and become amateur sleuths after a murder occurs in their own building. The premise is intriguing and has the potential to be a lot of fun, but the execution falls short in several key areas.

First and foremost, it must be said that Steve Martin and Martin Short are comedic geniuses. They bring their trademark humor and chemistry to their roles as Charles-Haden Savage and Oliver Putnam, respectively, and are easily the highlights of the show. Their banter and one-liners are a joy to watch and provide many of the show's funniest moments. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Selena Gomez, who plays Mabel Mora, the third member of the trio.

Gomez's acting leaves a lot to be desired. While she has improved over the years, her performance in ""Only Murders in the Building"" is often wooden and lacks the natural charisma of her co-stars. She struggles to keep up with Martin and Short's comedic timing and falls flat in several key scenes. It's clear that she's trying her best, but the contrast between her performance and that of Martin and Short is stark.

The direction of the show is solid, with a clear vision and style that sets it apart from other comedies. Director Jamie Babbit infuses the show with a sense of whimsy that suits the offbeat premise, and the show's visuals are often striking. The use of split screens and other stylistic flourishes adds to the show's charm and helps to keep things visually interesting.

The acting of the supporting cast is also good, with standout performances from Nathan Lane as a washed-up actor and Amy Ryan as a grieving widow. Each of the characters in the show is given a distinct personality and backstory, which helps to flesh out the world and make it feel lived-in.

The story itself is entertaining, with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience guessing. The show's central mystery is intriguing, and the way it slowly unfolds over the course of the season is well done. The show also delves into themes of loneliness, friendship, and obsession, which adds depth to the characters and makes the stakes feel higher.

However, the story does have some noticeable plot holes that are hard to ignore. Several key developments feel contrived and lack the necessary setup to make them feel believable. The show also relies heavily on coincidences to move the plot forward, which can be frustrating for viewers looking for a more cohesive narrative.

Overall, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a mediocre show that falls short of its potential. While Martin and Short are comedic powerhouses, Gomez's performance leaves a lot to be desired. The direction and supporting cast are solid, and the story is entertaining, but the plot holes are hard to ignore. Despite its flaws, the show may still be worth checking out for fans of the cast or the mystery genre. However, viewers looking for a standout comedy or mystery may be disappointed."
7.0,16 September 2021,"I tried to like this - it's got two legends which alone could carry the show. It's just S. Gomez' wretched acting. She had no chemistry with both Martin and Short. Her lines were delivered in this nonchalant, I don't care, monotone way. Every scene with her was cringe. I tapped out at ep. 2."
8.0,25 August 2022,"A real treat. Easy going setting. Great characters full of warmth and secrets.

A real fan of Steve Martin and this serves up well for him.

Will there end up being a hundred murders/ers in one building. I hope they do string out a few more seasons that's for sure.

2 great seasons deserves 2 seasons more."
7.0,19 January 2024,"I love the quirkiness of the show, and it's obviously carried by Steve Martin and Martin Short. I'm sure there aren't as many roles out there for older comedians like them, but they definitely deserve this chance to shine. And it's nice to see a series like this doing something out of the ordinary. The premise of season three with them putting on a Broadway show was a great choice. Meryl adds a lot, as you would expect. So does the supporting cast. I laughed out loud at some scenes. But I am so tired of Selena's monotone voice and non-acting. It's so distracting. I wish they could replace her with someone else and keep the show going."
3.0,26 August 2022,"Really, Hulu, Amy Schumer? This show was almost perfect. She's a terrible comedian and actor. Please, please, don't do that again. I just cringe whenever I hear her speak.

Anyway, the rest of the show is amazing. Selena sometimes looks awkward with her acting, BUT I love how her mellowness tones down Steve and Martin. They are all perfect together and play off each other well. Steve is a quiet funny, Martin is much more obnoxious and silly, but in a good way, and Selena is quippy and chill. The cast is perfect.

I love the comedy, the mystery, the story-telling, and how it is all weaved together. It's not overly thrilling, but the writing/storyline is interesting enough, so the thrilling part doesn't necessarily have to be there. It's one of my favorite shows. I wish the episodes were longer. I'm afraid we are going to binge watch this way too quickly and I don't want it to be over!"
10.0,19 June 2023,"Martin Short and Steve Martin make the show as well as some of the other actors. Why Selena Gomez was chosen for the part I will never know. I am certain there are other more talented young women out there. Her constant monotone whiney voice never changes the Entire first season that I've watched so far. Hoping she improves during the second? But based on some of the comments on here I guess not. She has no personality, is extremely rude, bitter and not in a way that makes one empathize with her character. She grates on ones nerves but I try to ignore as much as I can bc I love the writing and of course Stave Martin, Martin short and Nathan Lane. Loved how finally the Armenian and Greek genocide is getting some attention in a Hollywood show/film among a couple other surprises. Just some little things I've noticed that make it a bit more desirable to me. But overall love the mystery and hoping Selena works on her acting and becomes a little more engaging as the show progresses."
10.0,14 September 2021,It has everything it needs Selena was awesome they're were jokes which had no sense but had humor totally awesome I don't know the PG but I think it's 9+ because even it's a murder it's not that scary. And hulu man can u please give the episodes quicker like seriously by the time I see the next episode I forget the last part.
9.0,1 September 2021,"Steve Matin is great! Martin Short is rocking it!!! Love it!! Feels good!! If you want to make it great, replace Gomez. Sadly she has no personality :( you can not mix blame with lively HUGE personalities. Sorry but Its's a freight train moving along and Gomez is the mud that slows and drags it down."
10.0,20 July 2022,"The first season was decent, in fact mostly enjoyable to watch, although it could get a little frustrating at times, so hence the fast forward comment. Season two is not decent, it's hard to watch and the fast forward gets used a lot more, which is a shame. The reason for the negativity of season two is simple, Amy Schumer, she just does not fit, in fact I'd go as far to say her character and performance is cringe-worthy. For the love of me I can't understand where the idea came to put her in any part of this show, sorry but the proof is in the viewing. Selena Gomez is actually the star of the show, she holds the balance of the three main characters and makes it work, Steve Martin plays to his strengths and you get what you expect from him. Martin Short can be frustrating at times, and at other times he can be really funny, but he fits into the chemistry of the show. I honestly think ""Only Murders In The Building"" could be a real winner, it needs a little help with the storyline and script but it has real potential. Also some of the other characters could come into play a little more, Bunny was a great character but unfortunately season two kind of put a crimp in that idea. There are others though that could be capitalised on such as Howard, Teddy, Detective William's (I really like her) plus the Podcast Critics are all really good characters to play on."
10.0,22 November 2021,"As a whodunit, it's predictable, but that's not the point. This is all about having some fun along the way - about finding humour in awkwardness, about pushing some shallow characters beyond breaking point and enjoying watching them bumble their way through, never far from disaster.

It's a classic diversion, and accomplishes this very well. So put the magnifying glass away Sherlock and have some fun. Steve Martin is at his best when he can't stand up and Martin Short is at his when he's obnoxious. In this show they make fun of themselves to good effect."
10.0,7 July 2022,"...but Selena Gomez's speaking voice is really putting me off. I like Martin Short and Steve Martin, I'm ok with Selena Gomez. To be fair, I have only seen one episode so far. I don't want to give it a 1 like most reviewers who get put off by a little summin (on any show) and after 10 mins of watching they rate a show 1. That's just ridiculous.

I'm on the fence because of Selena's voice. Same thing happened on a movie she was in - Woody Allen's A Rainy Day in New York - but I got through it because of Timothee Chalamet.

But this is a series. Can I manage to get through it? I don't know."
7.0,1 September 2021,"First, I LOVE Martin Short and Steve Martin. I need to say that because it's hard for me to admit that I dislike this show because I love those two so much. Having said that, I think this show is so bad! I'm struggling to get through episode three and decided to check IMDb to look for likeminded comments and I am shocked to see an almost 9 rating.

Also, and this is what is annoying me the most about this series-the gratuitous use of the F word is so forced and weird. I cuss like a sailor and some days it seems like every other word out of my mouth is the F bomb but on this show it's as if they had a quota to fill. None of it seems genuine and all of it makes me cringe."
10.0,1 September 2022,"Everyone will talk of the obvious stellar star cast , their captivating performances but I would like to adulation their tonal quality which is simply supreme !!!

Don't know who did what with the sounds but their voices are so distinguished and the way they deliver their dialogue is just so powerful.

Wether it's any apartment , cafeteria , every minute detail is visible to the eye.

This one would be loved by generations to Come ... a classic has been created All the three protagonists are so comfortable with each other , they give room for mutual betterment and no one is into ""one up"" mode."
7.0,17 December 2021,"It's like they combined Kimmy Schmidt with a Wes Anderson movie. You might not always be in the mood for it, but when you are, it's perfect. Also, if you (like me) are a podcast geek, you will love some of the references (like how the successful podcaster says her line and then goes into a Squarespace ad - I kept waiting for someone to say they 'put the pub in public radio').

Anyway, highly recommended."
2.0,4 November 2021,"A true crime podcast born from a murder in the building shared by a seemingly lost young woman living in her aunts apt, a washed up sitcom star still holding on to the past, and a wishful wannabe struggling to make ends meet. As the plot twists and turns it fills you with just enough dark humor to express wit and enough subtle drama to keep you glued with anticipation.

MUST WATCH! Good for Selena Gomez to get teamed up with 2/3 of the 3 Amigos!"
10.0,17 October 2021,"A subscriber of Hulu and will be devoted on price and content. Evens out.

As Steve Martin and Martin Short! Yes! Of course Selena stepped up her game to work with them. How can it be they are working together?

It hums. Loving it. Especially seeing martin and short doing their thing! (Big fan!)

I don't like to have to tune in to an episode every week. Which is kind of done. Netflix has those. But is willing to put a full season on demand. You binge watch. I wait for that.

So far after hearing a season ender for the show. I am now gonna watch it as a subscriber to hulu. Reservation Dogs is another. But cant commit to a show that always gets cancelled. Been burned a lot.

One being Firefly. Million to one. If they still have the content and can reinvigorate the show. Lights some fires up on some asses. But cannot when studios say. Meh.

Happy w this show."
10.0,10 October 2021,Love it and I now consider myself an Arconiac. Episode 7 in particular takes a leap. The cast is great and I tuned in for Martin & Short. My biggest complaint is waiting for weekly episodes.
10.0,1 September 2021,"OMITB is a misterious story, each one of the residents have its own secret and the series executed that really well. However, it is quite funny and enjoyable to watch. Steven Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez did a outstanding job this time."
10.0,14 March 2022,"If you want to see a very creative, smartly-cast, visually-stylish, amazingly-musically-scored, atmospheric, superfunny comedy with a neat murder mystery, look no further than ""Only murders in the building"". It's very pleasant viewing, just a delight to watch (and listen to). My opinion is also that its dramatic elements range from inspired and excellent to lame and paint-by-the-numbers, and the acting slips on occasion. Now, my cultural-geographic and age-related demographic profile means that I only know Selena Gomez of the three leads, I've listened to a few of her songs, and I like at least one ('Good for you"", with ADollar-SignAP Rocky), she's a perfectly decent singer. She's a pretty decent actress too, as it turns out, but she stumbles at times and needs to develop a bit more range. People sometimes seem to think that playing an emotionally-reserved character means being a bad actor, which is absolutely dumb, but Selena's not entirely without fault here. To be fair, I also would say that about Steve Martin, and he has decades of experience, and as such fewer excuses. In the meantime, while Martin Short's character has cringier moments, for the most part he's an absolute joy to behold, a charming, jovial aesthete and wheeler-dealer of the art world, a formidable theatre director past his prime. He outshines the other two a little bit for me, I guess I'm a ""Putnut"" by the show's own terminology.

This series is in a way a love-letter to New York's elite classes' scene, where intelligentsia and bourgeoisie mix. I'm not sure whether I'll ever watch through ""Russian doll"", which taps into the same captivating surroundings, while a seemingly worse series, but this one surely sates my appetite for a while. The premise is as follows: three ""bohemian layabouts"" (if you know, you know), two of them very elderly, live in a big housing complex, the Arconia. They share a passion for ""true crime"" podcasts and, befriending each other by chance, decide to launch their own when a murder occurs in the building. They won't cover any other murders, ""only murders in the building"", see? In a way, the tidal wave of podcasting is presented as a modern reimagining of the classic ""American Dream"", or ""conquering New York"", where even your average Jane, or some have-been down-on-their-luck losers can have a shot at grabbing a huge audience, and captivating people's minds. To be fair, the podcasting stuff is more of a backdrop: it informs a lot of things, but the series is very liberal with assumed time-skips, so we mostly see the sleuthing, not the recording, and a lot of events happen off-screen. But this unlikely trio not only desperately tries to solve the case (or figure out whether there is at all a case), they also legitimately develop chemistry, and help each other grow. Here the show loses me a little bit: Mabel's story is interesting (Zoe is a great character with a very cool plotline, mostly told in the most creative episode of the show with minimal spoken dialogue), but is executed a bit handwavily, and Charles' story occasionally is quite lame and cringy. The actual, central mystery is, however, pretty neat, even if there are some simplistic, cliche-ish parts. Something to fix for the upcoming Season 2, hopefully. They have a true jewel with this series, it just needs more refinement.

Finally, as to the overall presentation of the show: the colourful, stylised intro sequences and outro stills are great, and the music that plays sporadically throughout the series and during some of the outros is absolutely euphoric - outros of episodes 2 and 3 especially brought me total bliss, I really gotta find the OST on YouTube. Additionally, a neat little detail is that episodes typically begin with some abstract ponderings by a character, typically a supporting one, new each time. It's not a hugely important detail, but I found it a nice bit of flair."
10.0,28 December 2021,
7.0,30 November 2021,"I've just binged this over the last 6 or so hours and for the most part it was great!. I really enjoyed the characters, the actors playing them, the directing, music, literally everything to do with the production up until the last two episodes.

Don't get me wrong the last two episodes did still hit all the boxes except one, it was two episodes too long for the story, things could have made more sense if ep7 was a round up but I think they could have done it on ep6. Ironically I think the money men got involved to leave it needing a second season.

Personally I kind of hope there won't be another one because of how wrong and cliched the ending was, it was fun while it lasted.

If this had been a stand alone 6/7 episode show it would have got a 10."
10.0,1 September 2021,"I watched the first three episodes, and really, really, hoped to like this series. The first episode was good, the second was okay, and by the third I was catching up on social media, emails, and texts instead of watching the show. The characters are shallow, boring, and uninteresting. What a shame, considering the abilities of the cast and writers."
7.0,2 September 2021,"At last a really easy watching show. Funny, interesting, mysterious...has everything! Love it!!!"
1.0,30 September 2021,"So whitty and well written. Fun to follow and impressed by Gomez. She filled the role well. Missed Steve and Martin, missed Nathan too! Can't wait for this to continue. Curious how many murdera can happen in the building though, may need to extend the radius."
10.0,4 October 2021,"The show is really interesting and I find it fun to follow along and figure out the clues throughout the show. I see a lot of hate about the actors but I think that the comedic trio of Martin Short, Steve Martin, and Selena Gomez is gold. All three bring different things to the table and I honestly think most reviewers just hate Selena because that's what I seen most reviews focusing and not really on the show it's self. It appeals to both older and younger generations. The one character I actually don't really enjoy is Jan I find her a slightly boring but still intriguing nonetheless. The whole idea behind the podcast is really fun and I like that it allows them to pursue different suspects in each episode. I also enjoyed the mystery's that are being revealed throughout. It gives the audience a thrill trying to chase down the killer along with them. Plus the title sequence is amazing! Really cool and creative plus it incorporates a clue/nod to something in each episode.

Definitely worth the watch!"
9.0,18 September 2022,"Season 3: omg! This is the best thing I have every watched till now. Meryl Streep! You are a queen of cinema, theater all kind of art. This is like a lesson of acting. 3*8 episode, final scene, I really cried. This is really really best show. I love it. Dialogues also super.

Season 2 final update :excellent from the beginning to the end! Costumes, drama, funny elements, characters, story, cast! Perfect! I am looking forward to 3rd season. This is the best show of 2022 for me..

Till now I watched 4 episodes and I can say this is really really good, I love the characterizations much. This is not only about solving a mystery series also very nice story telling about older people life. ( at least I did take the story like that) Selena Gomez is big surprise for me, she is so cool and good choice for her role. So far I love everything. I hope it continues in that way till the end. Sting is another good surprise on 3 and 4th episodes. I think this series give me everything what I want ; mystery, fun, curiosity a little drama and really good actors. I highly recommend to watch.."
9.0,9 January 2022,"I've never wanted a next season of a show so badly as I want this. This series completely surpassed expectations. I mean it's hard to go wrong with Steve Martin and Martin Short anyway, but I think this is the best thing they've ever been in. And everyone else is excellent with some great cameos. The dialogue and plotting is second to none, with twist after twist. I love Murder mysteries and this can teach all the others a thing or too even the British ones. It's a fantastic cross genre of mystery and dramedy. I'm not usually a binger so I took about a week to go through the series but now please bring on the next series immediately. It is insanely brilliant."
9.0,27 May 2022,"This show is, despite Selena Gomez' monotone voice and lack of acting abilities, surprisingly good. The plot and story line are enjoyable, it's fun. This isn't brain-teasing stuff, it's simple, easy, wholesome entertainment but there's too little of that nowadays.

Yes, it's carried by Steve and Martin (hah hah), and would be better if it featured more Steve Martin. Or Martin short funny skits. Ideally, both. Or just less monotone, dreary moments featuring Gomez. Surely they could have found a skilled actress to act in this?!? Rr."
10.0,11 September 2021,Just one sentence...... I'm loving it!!!!.....It is so gooooood!!!
9.0,28 June 2022,"Decent whodunnit with great comedic actors that we really haven't seen much from in the last ten years

I like anything with steve Martin so if you like him you'll like this

Selena Gomez is nothing special in this basically just used her fame (smartly I might add) to bring relevance to this worthy show

Worthwhile watch you won't be dissatisfied or bored."
7.0,25 October 2021,"I really like Steve Martin and Martin Short - so I really wanted (and expected) to like this show.

It's just not good.

And they totally mispronounced the name of the Oklahoma town ""Chickasha"" (not ""Chickasaw""). I think that one glaring mistake just destroyed the whole illusion for me."
8.0,12 September 2021,"Steve Martin , Martin Short and Selena Gomez are so good together."
7.0,21 October 2021,
2.0,31 August 2022,"I really enjoy this show. It's funny and has a good mix of mystery and twists in it as well. Sure some of it is a little clich√© but when I want to watch a mystery story I expect certain themes and actions to play out as they do in a mystery story!! The mix of the comedy is great.

The 3 leads have great chemistry. Gomez feels like the third musketeer to Steve Martin & Martin Short. I enjoyed watching those three build a relationship throughout the show. The other tenants performances and the apartment building meetings are fantastic comedy scenes that gave me legit laugh out loud moments. If you want to watch a fun show then give this a shot."
9.0,9 December 2021,"So, I thought I'll just watch the first episode then get to bed a somewhat reasonable hour for a change, that is not now going to happen.

Already I can tell this show will be a joy to watch. As others have already pointed out in the comments the writing, acting, directing, pace, music, setting etc, etc are all much above the usual standard broadcast, streamed or downloaded to and by us. This show is a bright and beguiling treat. Now, dear friends, on to episode 2."
8.0,31 July 2022,"I don't ever write reviews but I had to fit this incredible show! This is one of the best shows I have seen in a very long time! Great cast and great story! Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez all have great chemistry together. The murder mystery storyline is awesome and really keeps you guessing! I really hope they come out with more than just two seasons!"
9.0,8 April 2022,
10.0,25 September 2021,"Nice to see Steve Martin and Martin Short back together again, and with Selena Gomez, to boot!

I've been around for over fifty years, so Martin and Short's older stuff is right in my wheelhouse.

As to the show, it is a slow burn, but very enjoyable. There is no knee-slapping, laugh out loud comedy here, so don't go into this thinking you are going to see humour such as you find in, ""The Man with Two Brains"", or ""The Jerk"", but there is great subtle humour, as one obserbes when spending time with friends.

As of episode six, there are twists and turns, but most are not obvious, and keep me genuinely interested in where the show is going.

I am enjoying the gradual revelations of the characters' backstories, and the stories of others as they become more important to the plot.

My one hope is that this is all leading up to a payoff that makes sense, and has a destination that is worthy of the journey."
9.0,1 October 2023,"When I first started to watch ONLY MURDERS I couldn't get into it..,After a few days I went back to it and glad I did..,it really got better and I was hooked. Steve Martin and Martin Short have worked together and have been friends for decades..,they play off each other effortlessly. Selena Gomez was very good and fit into the crime solving trio perfectly.. I found myself watching episodes over again because I enjoyed them so much and found them extremely entertaining..,I could have done without some of the actors they introduced as cameos.. I'll let you decide that for yourself.. the murders they solve are interesting as they unfold and you will find yourself surprised.. I'm all caught up and on Season 3.. I've enjoyed watch this show so much and it is one of my favorites.. hope there will be more seasons..,"
8.0,2 March 2023,"I had this show recommended to me by a few people, but I procrastinated over watching it, because murder - mystery ""whodunnit"" shows are not my favourite genre. I find that generally they try to hit too many targets without nailing one well. I mean do you really want a show to be a comedy - crime - drama - mystery - thriller? Make up your mind.

Anyway, despite those initial concerns I actually really quite enjoyed this. Easy to watch, the cast bounced off each other well. The humour was thankfully not over the top. I found Selena Gomez's dry delivery (that some are complaining about here) to be spot on, and Steve Martin & Martin Short played their characters well (although together they will always be two of the Three Amigos to me). Plus I didn't pick the ending of season one.

Easy watching and I can see why it's been a hit. 7.5/10 if that was allowed for me."
6.0,10 December 2021,"Even if you have nothing to watch, avoid this! Great acting but the show itself is drawn out, dry and boring! Moments they're trying to be funny, its actually cringe worthy because it feels like the actors are forcing themselves to be funny!"
10.0,2 October 2021,"Like wt.? Why ? Why did you end it here, my baby me neeeeeed more of that! When is it coming back ?"
6.0,20 October 2021,"I started watching OMITB on a whim because I had nothing else to watch, but I wasn't expecting it to have such a grip over me in short time that I started to eagerly wait for it's new episode every week.

It starts off pretty slow and some might even find it cliche and boring in the beginning, but once I embraced how zany and colorful these characters are and what they could bring to the table in terms of storytelling from different points of views, I got hooked.

Even the finale did two things right that shows these days struggle with, it gave a satisfactory ending to a well-built story and successfully teased a new one for those interested without feeling forced or awkward.

But in the end this is my opinion, it's up to you if you want to give this a try."
1.0,30 July 2022,
9.0,30 August 2022,"First off, my cup of tea is some action, blood and fantasy, and yet, this show blew my mind. Never thought I could enjoy small set mystery investigation so damn much.

Point one: Just watching the intro and listening to the music puts all my day's work behind me and let's me relax and enjoy what is coming.

Point two: The fun and jokes in the show are enjoyable, non-cringy and sometimes let you spray drink on you screen from the sudden laugh... ehm.

Point three: The characters are truly lovable, can stir your compassion and make you care.

Lastly, all in all the story is fun and not very predictable. Though it grips you and makes you want to binge watch the whole thing, it is just perfect for turning everything off and just enjoying the ride of relaxation better than a a massage or jacuzzi."
8.0,1 December 2021,"Thanks to the cast - it was such a fun watching the twist and turns. The building, the flair of Manhattan and all the different personalities living in the Arconia made the plot. Looking forward to a all ready announced season 2."
9.0,3 September 2021,"This show is great, in that Steve Martin & Martin Short play 2 different-personality amateur sleuths. It's generally light-hearted, and is meant to be. What I find distracting and detracting is the amount of f-words used, mostly by Selena. I get that she is supposed to be a third personality type in the trio, a sarcastic younger-generation versus two older guys, but the frequency and ease with which she says f-word iterations definitely takes this series out of the ""sweet"" classification that some reviewers are calling it, and her. I wonder if she talks that way in real life, or if it's mainly because the writers wrote it that way, or maybe both.

Thumbs down to the writers for trying to spice it up in this manner. And points-off from Selena for going along with it. Unfortunately it seems that it's currently in vogue for folks to talk this way in public, online, social media etc.

Believe me, I have heard every vulgarity in the book during my social services career jobs, and have been called every foul name; but that doesn't mean that it should be considered okay, normal, acceptable for people with any amount of Class to talk that way."

10.0,5 October 2023,"Wow, yes you need more words than that, but it's pretty concise. If this show was wonderful for the first 2 seasons then this season has been elevated to extraordinary!!!! Getting to see the team back together is only the beginning. To see Paul Rudd, a good bonus. The other real treat is Martin Short playing opposite the queen of Hollywood, Meryl Streep. We know he has always been a phenomenal talent. He's comedic talent spans decades. But to see his dramatic talent go head to head with Meryl Streep, wow! He is a true master! Not only will both the Emmy and Golden Globe committees be nominating Meryl Streep, but Martin Short for sure! Moreover, this season was a showcase of many talented singing artists, Steve Martin, Meryl Streep, Selena Gomez, Martin Short, it brings back Da'Vine Joy Randolph, who is a joy, pun intended, to watch. The show is a winner with a winning premise."
9.0,3 October 2022,"Season one was hilarious. It seemed original enough, and the cast really clicked. I'm a huge fan of ANYTHING Steve Martin does, and I also really like Martin Short. Selena Gomez was reasonably good as the ""kid"", but it was really the Martin & Short show. The 2nd season just seems to drone on, like the writers were worn out from season one. There are plenty of decent gags & one-liners from Martin & Short, but the rest is annoying filler. Schumer was horrible - she must have paid someone off to get in this. They also had to play the *yawn* woke card in season 2, just like every other product out of Hollywierd today. Too bad - it had alot of promise at the start."
7.0,25 September 2021,"Good lucking thinking SCTV, SNL, or of the classic Steve Martin movies make for good press...they should, but this is cry boring. Pretend they're not even there, as it is hang-yourself-now levels of dull. I and the other reviewers have got your back here. You WILL never get that time back."
10.0,4 November 2021,"Steve Martin and Martin Short are great in this. Selena Gomez can't really act and has to always be carried in pretty much every scene. She can do things(like walk around, be sneaky or do some action scenes) but when it comes to actually acting, she can't really do facial expressions. You can really see that in the scenes with oscar and her mom, where it feels like a crappy cw show. I don't know how she got past audition.

The writing, directing and sound design are all great but man Selena Gomez really adds nothing to the show, thankfully they don't have too many scenes focusing on her face while she is acting so we are spared a bit."
7.0,26 January 2022,"And already made a connection with it!

Only murders in the building is a great action comedy with a very good finale that sums up the first season and leave's you on the hook for the second one.

The pacing is good, soundtracks also and the mute episode is a great episode. Some actors were not so great unfortunately but the rest nailed it."
2.0,14 October 2021,"I am thoroughly enjoying this show! Selena Gomez is not a name that I would have come up with to put with Martin and Short, but she is a great foil for the older actors. I find it refreshing and, in a definite change from most of the latest ""mysteries"" that I have seen, unpredictable."
10.0,27 July 2022,"In a growing sea of mindless garbage television, this show is a gem. A cozy murder mystery, the show is intriguing, funny, and at times heartfelt. The characters are all unique and well developed. Steve Martin and Martin Short bring some of their best work to the show. Selena Gomez is a surprising standout. The chemistry and dynamic between the three main characters is a rare and delightful treat. The show does a fantastic job balancing mystery and comedy, and is wholly enjoyable. Truly a delight!"
8.0,19 August 2022,PLEASE NEVER STOP MAKING NEW EPISODES I LOVE THIS SHOW. It's a mix of everything I love and it's literally perfect. I love the characters. I love the concept. I love it all!
10.0,26 July 2022,
10.0,10 September 2021,"In style, not story. Has similar feel to it, kinda quirky and mysterious with glimpses of warmth and deeper themes. While I doubt it will be a series I remember long after finishing it, I will enjoy the ride while it lasts and look forward to the next episode. I suppose that's I'll I'm looking for, an entertaining distraction that has something more to talk about than just sex and violence. I recommend giving it a try, it will be clear in the first episode whether or not it's for you."
10.0,10 March 2024,"The writing is fantastic. The chemistry between the lead cast is surprising brilliant while the supporting cast have their characters so well developed which then leads back to outstanding direction. Very high production values, the story lines, twists and witty lines coupled with lot of slapstick makes sure you ain't regret it. ! Martin shorts high energy comedic timing is perfectly offset by steve Martin's more controlled comedy and selena gomez is totally brilliant to watch.. Be it her deadpan dialogues or her acting as someone with troubles of her own, she is a pleasure to watch!!

If you are like me you will know 20 mins in that this is GOLD!!

MUST WATCH."
8.0,23 September 2021,"Fun series to watch, especially for anyone who grew up watching Steve Martin comedies. He and Martin Short have such great comedic chemistry.

BUT....as much as I like the character of Mabel, Selena Gomez' acting and awkward monotone voice are hard to watch. She's a talented singer, but good God, she has zero expression.

Obviously the producers wanted a well known name to appeal to younger crowds, but Selena's inability to convey any type of emotion, is horribly distracting from the show.

Aside from her performance and the awkwardly placed/'forced' sounding F-bombs being thrown out left, right and center, its an amusing, easy watch with some very impressive guest stars."
7.0,1 October 2021,"I had high hopes for this series.

Love a lot of the cast.

This is so bad, it makes me ..... sad.

No idea how so many people rated it high."
10.0,7 September 2021,"The plot is really intriguing. It includes equal amount of mystery, comedy,drama etc which keeps you hooked up. Every time a new ep releases I keep craving for more. Right now everyone seems suspicious. And all the actors did a really great job. I'd give this drama 10/10."
6.0,2 July 2022,
5.0,31 August 2021,"Already knew that Steve Martin and Martin Short are legends and they are finest, greatest actors but Selena Gomez omg she totally slayed the character 'Mabel Mora'. The storyline is so interesting and fun. In total, it's a amazing show to watch."
9.0,27 August 2023,"This show has: 1. Very clever humor that sometimes makes me think before I get it 2) A mix of characters that shouldn't work but absolutely does 3) Constant surprises and twists 4) Amazing guest stars 5) Fun and intertwined storylines 6) Mrs. Gambolini!

My husband and I were hooked from the first episode. We watch it as intensely as the show characters follow their podcast. Thank heavens there is now season three!

My husband and son are involved in barbershop style singing, and we were on the floor laughing at the yodelshop - so funny and clever.

The show is a fun escape from the worries of life, and we look forward to every new episode, as well as re-watching previous ones. We hope the series continues for many years."
10.0,1 September 2021,This is a very campy and genuine show with a top notch musical score.
8.0,20 March 2022,
8.0,13 October 2021,We are watching this with my teenage girls as they really enjoy it finding the two old men quite hilarious. But was it so necessary to use the F word so often?
10.0,7 April 2023,I started watching this in 2022 and loved it. I've finished it now and it was the most amazing show I've ever watched. I almost cried when the season 2 was over. There was still a mystery to solve!!! Hope the next series is as great as the first and second. I love the tricks and schemes and all the murders. I just really love this show all of it I must admit there wasn't 1 part I didn't like. A bit of feedback though could you make so magic for Howard I feel like he was so nice so I found it unlikely he was the murderer. I really love this show and by seeing the ratings I'm pretty sure that quite a few people who do too. Thanks for reading.
9.0,25 September 2021,"I'm a HUGE Martin Short fan. I also love Steve Martin...so I watched.

They were wonderful at first (just what I expected)...then... It almost seemed like the Director ""got in the way""...? They weren't allowed to do what they do BEST...then.

It just got too woke. Almost as an afterthought they started ""placing"" politically correct characters into the story...(don't get me wrong. I LOVE diversity in entertainment...but this seemed forced).

So now, I still watch...but I'm not ""into it"" as much as I should be. (And I ff thru some parts)."
6.0,27 October 2022,"So all in all it's a 5 out of 10.

I was looking forwards to Season Two but it was stretchy and boring and kept on dragging. I watched the first five episodes over the course of three days and I was just ""Be done."" So I skipped all the other episodes (six, seven, eight and nine) and watched episode ten. That was enough to get it wrapped up without having the feeling you missed something.

Besides Selena Gomez being a snooze fest, throwing other stars to a lame story (for season two) doesn't work. The budget should have gone two story writing and a six episode final season.

Be gone murders. Leave my building."
9.0,5 February 2023,"Only Murders is a really good show. The premise is interesting. I know Martin and Short have been friends for many, many years, but Gomez has slotted in nicely and the 3 of them have an easy chemistry.

Martin Short is hilarious, Steve Martin is solid as usual and Selena Gomez is great ""mothering"" them with their old fashioned quotes and ways and trying to be hip üòÜ. It was a great idea to have different generations in the mix to keep it fresh and open up the comedy options. The supportive cast have been excellent as well. Each person is perfect for their role. The final ep of season 2 is a classic with the ""party"". Some great lines from everyone kept the laughs coming.

We've binged both seasons and it's kept us guessing ""who done it"" each season. Looking forward to season 3 with Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep!"
7.0,12 July 2022,"It's so awesome to see our favorite actors on screen working together again! I literally can't wait for every episode to see what happens next. Growing up watching the some of the best movies starring Steve Martin, Martin Short and Nathan Lane and hopefully others to make an appearance in this series is so refreshing and so wonderful to laugh with them again. Hope they have many seasons ahead!"
5.0,13 November 2023,"I hadn't watched its trailer before I started watching the series. It was my boredom that pushed me to search for new exciting tv shows and somehow I stumbled on it, the rating actually convinced me to watch it.

And I was amazed how good the 1st Season was. The 2nd Season if wasn't better than 1st was still a good watch. And the 3rd was the best of all. The direction and acting in the 3rd is absolutely fantastic. In all 3 seasons, you keep guessing the murderer and end up being wrong. It's that much of a fun.

It's very rare for a new season to match the hype of the previous one. And I gotta say that this ones stands out.

Just when I had thought that how many murders can happen in the hotel & this may be the last season, the show keeps surprising us with new twists.

I can't wait for it to return next season."
10.0,7 July 2022,"Drives me crazy to watch shows that have a character who is pregnant constantly hold onto their belly! Is this something that the directors are asking the actors to do? Seriously, holding onto their belly like it's a ball about to drop. I find it so distracting. It seems to be the thing nowadays. Not just in TV and movies but social media too. Enough already."
8.0,6 August 2023,"Original, star filled and funny. You won't see the suspects coming. Throughly enjoyable even if it drops the f-bomb frequently. Selena Gomez has successfully moved past her Disney self, while sharing and holding her own against longtime favorite comedy duo Martin-short with other surprising names to boot. Some who fall into similar roles you've seen them in before and some who add new dimensions to themselves.

A binge worthy of subscribing to Hulu. Looking forward to the 3rd and future seasons.

Can't think of sixty more words to add to meet the 600 characters, which is a lot. Most are 250!!!"
10.0,20 August 2023,"Fun, serious, hilarious, and goofy. Great actors and storylines.

The characters are so fun and interesting, and all of the cameos and multiple sides of each character that are revealed make it feel like a mix of a book series, theater, and movie.

The theater theme is intertwined with every part of the show and it often feels like watching a play.

The funny parts are sometimes laugh out loud and sometimes just a smirk or a chortle.

Some parts are truly sad, some are so curious that it's hard not to keep watching, even when it's way past bedtime.

Martin Short and Steve Martin are amazing together after years of a professional and personal friendship, which is obvious in this series."
9.0,31 August 2021,"I love Steve Martin but this is so lame and contrived for wealthy New Yorkers. I feel like I'm watching an old peoples version of Nancy Drew in an rccentric hotel. I started watching for great actors, but not so great in this seies."
10.0,13 July 2022,"This is odd to say, but this show feels funny and gentle and wholesome to me, even though it's about murder! I think it's the friendships at the heart of it. Not only is it somehow soothing to watch, it's also one of the few shows that can consistently make me laugh out loud each week. I have loved Steve Martin and Martin Short for years, and Selena Gomez makes a perfect dry straight woman to them. Brilliantly written with an emphasis on character and heart, and always funny without trying too hard. The direction and music are stellar, too. And the episodes that focus on one character are amazing little polished jewel character studies, that also move the entire season's story arc forward. So great that the show has the confidence to mix it up like that, those episodes are true works of art. This has become my current feel good show- yes, a show about murder!"
9.0,14 January 2022,"I had fun all the way also it has great flow and ofcourse the actors are masters.

The murder misteries never got so fun and intriguing, and what makes it more artistic is that it happens in New york and you have other artists that are related to the story. <3

Cant wait for season 2; if there will be."
7.0,9 December 2022,"Season one was great. Amazing chemistry between Steve Martin and Martin Short. Selena Gomez is good, not great.

Season two is also very good, but Amy Schumer is in several episodes playing herself and, man, she is just difficult to look at. Disgusting outside and in. Sooooo unfunny. A terrible actress to boot. Not sure why they chose her. You can't look at her without puking a bit into your mouth.

I really hope she's in as few episodes of season two as Sting was in season one. Sting is a FAR better actor than Schumer, and though he's not a ""comedian"" like Schumer, he's FAR funnier, and though I'm straight, I find Sting FAR more attractive than Schumer."
8.0,7 October 2024,
7.0,7 March 2022,"In an episodic world that seems to be dominated by romance themes, Only Murders in the Building revitalizes the thrill of mystery. Steve Martin's mannerisms, timing, and energy is inspiring. Not to mention the intro design, the music and writing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.

Martin Short, you're an inspiration. Truly, truly sensational."
1.0,16 September 2021,"Well put together, good writing. Selena Gomez is great & definitely keeps you interested. If you love anything true crime or murder mystery this is a must watch."
10.0,2 April 2022,"Best show can't wait for season two!

The best part is that after they solve one case it's not like waiting for the season 2 for something to happen, it happens the mystery is solved, but there's completely something different happening and than the season is ending, that's what I love about it, it keeps you entertained."
9.0,3 July 2022,"Now this is an entertaining comedy. Smart, sharp and mostly very funny. Steve Martin in particular nails it with his deadpan style.

Beautifully written and directed."
9.0,15 July 2023,"This is a fantastic watch, even the second season was just as good as the first.

The acting is spot on and to date, was not bored at all a good series to binge watch.

It keeps you on your toes with funny parts and thrilling parts.

All 3 main characters are prefect for their roles in this series.

I was hooked from the first episode.

This murder mystery series has everything you want and need.

There are twists all the way through it. If you take out them trying to solve a murder, their characters are very relatable. And to top it off Amy Schumer plays a short but great role in it It's a must must seen."
8.0,18 May 2022,"I haven't actually seen any films of Steve Martin and Martin Short before, but after this show I watched every clip of them on Youtube and they really are hilarious!

The show is about a trio of true crime podcast fans-Oliver (Martin Short), Charles (Steve Martin) and Mable (Selena Gomez). The three of them started bonding over a murder that happened in their building and decided to start their on podcast to investigate the murder.

The characters are very well-written, Selena Gomez really brought a great balance and the chemistry between the three is amazing! The storyline has some twist and turns, the pace is just right, the mysteries are not too predictable, and the show keeps running in a quirky, engaging, funny atmosphere.

Looking forward to the next season, the producers really did a great job casting Selena, her interviews with the duo are funny as well, it's like a gen-z babysitting her grandparents lol!

P. S. There was one episode when Martin Short visited his son, when he walked out of his son's home depressed and hopeless, then he recieved a text lighting up his hope- his facial expression in those few seconds were incredible, what a great actor!"
8.0,8 August 2023,"I'm 13 minutes into the first episode of season 3. The picture keeps going from sharp to blurry. It's definitely in the filming, there's nothing wrong with my television. Who was the cameraman and how is this allowed to air with this quality of work? It's already obvious to me that both the storyline and quality of acting are of high caliber. But the filming is truly awful and completely distracting from the story itself. I'm hoping that as the season progresses this problem doesn't repeat itself in future episodes. I did pause episode 1 to write this...maybe this only happened in the one scene? Hopefully. If so, still one scene too many."
10.0,29 August 2022,"A trio of true crime podcast enthusiasts investigate a murder in their building. Comedy murder mystery starring Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, plus lots of great cameos throughout.

This is a really fun show. It's modern, fast-paced and well-scripted, with strong leads, good chemistry, a decent (whodunnit) plot and with nice twists throughout. A great concept for a TV show.

The second season continues very much in the same vein but is not quite as good (it's less fresh, less exciting, with a weaker plot).

Overall, I enjoyed this show but Season 1 is somewhat more entertaining. Worth a watch."
7.0,14 August 2023,"I really like this show, and I'm not a fan of too many NY City movies or shows. I think NY is generally overrated and not nearly as interesting as New Yorkers seem to believe it is. But this show depicts it perfectly and is interesting, fun and has one of my favorites in it, Steve Martin!

I like Martin Short, but a little bit of Short goes a vey long way. They seemed to utilize his skills perfectly in the first season, but he is a bit much in season 2. I'm on episode 9, and in episode 8, he was wearing my nerves! I hope they reign him in. It is nice to see that Martin Short and Gomez are all Exec. Producers however.

Overall the show is fun and has a wonderful feel to it, is timed perfectly, edited vey well and Hulu did well."
10.0,28 September 2021,"I'm enjoying the series, fun and something to look forward to when another episode drops. A lifelong fan of Steve Martin I must admit, Martin Short's character is amusing also.

Is it just me or is the building the real star, I seriously want to go and visit Belnord apartments."
6.0,29 June 2022,"It was supposed to be funny, witty, and engaging, but I couldn't even finish the first episode; it's forced, it's bad chemistry, and it's terrifying how many fake reviews give this (insert your favourite insult) piece of garbage 8+ stars. It's truly the essence of bad writing, bad casting, bad target audience (jokes that could make it in 80s) in one. Avoid."
2.0,29 March 2022,"The trailer made this look like one of those desperate high-concept made for TV movies, or a bad reunion show. But it's fantastic. A tight, topical and insightful script - both comic and melancholic, bringing to mind Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Beautiful locations and cinematography. All the technicals are top notch, as is the casting and acting. Nothing about the show feels dated or out of touch.

The chemistry between Martin and Short is something to behold, so much so that ""Martin and Short"" might as well be admitted to the pantheon of ""Martin & Lewis"", etc. And it's great to see the singular Martin Short in a major role again.

Actually that's not true: it ought to be ""Martin & Short & Gomez"". I was baffled to see her name in the cast (I've not seen much of her work) but she not only fits in perfectly with Martin and Short, but I think her stoic, hard and (sort of) sweetness balances the combination of the two other leads (a mix akin to Kirk, Spock and McCoy.). Nothing about her presence seems obligatory. A great bit of casting, and the show wouldn't work without her.

Looking forward to season 7."
10.0,30 April 2022,Wonderful on all levels. I only deducted one star because I wish there weren't quite so many expletives; but I'm a Brit and thus somewhat inured to bad language. But everything else about it is just fabulous.
10.0,24 May 2022,I kinda fell across this one Sunday and was hooked by episode 2. A good story made with a great cast. Didn't expect the ending which was a bonus. Can't wait for the end of June for the next instalment.
9.0,25 September 2021,"I enjoy the premise, but Selena Gomez doesn't quiet fit the bill for me. She seems bothered and compared to her co workers, drab. I'm excited to see it progress!"
10.0,4 October 2023,"OMITB is really special and, while I understand that Selena Gomez was likely cast to incorporate her large/younger fan base as viewers, she is ruining this great show!

Martin Short and Steve Martin do the heavy lifting, entertainment-wise, but Selena's severely nasal voice and desert-dry acting is more than terrible... it's extremely distracting and offputting. If not for the magnificent aesthetics of that gorgeous building and the magic of the Short/Martin chemistry, I wouldn't be able to keep watching this show.

My husband and I started watching it together, but Selena's voice was a deal-breaker for him. He does keep trying, due to our love for Martin and Steve, but he can never sit thru any 'Mabel' scenes. I barely get thru them, myself.

I understand the deadpan/moody-youth character she is trying to play, but she is failing miserably. Better examples are Jenna Ortega as Wednesday or Lisa Kudrow as Ursula (Phoebe's twin, on Friends). It's not the character, as many Selena fans would argue, it's Selena. The acting is sub par and dry, her voice is way too nasal, and even her body language is constantly awkward. It also seems like the costume designer is working against her. Most of her looks are either ill-fitting or just hideous.

Short and Martin can/do carry this show on their own. I don't anticipate the showrunners will replace Selena at this late stage, but I do hope they reduce her lines in Season 4 to reduce the cringe-factor a bit.

This show has such charm and true Hollywood showmanship in the more mature members of the cast. While I can appreciate the dynamic of the generation gap between the stars of the show, 'Mabel' is quite immature in the way she responds to ""the olds"". The writers have her behaving like a moody teen, but she is nearly 30. This was a misstep. I hope they smooth it out in future seasons.

Overall, OMITB is a breath of fresh air amongst the massive quantity of garbage shows that keep showing up. If they stick to the mysteries and the relationship development between the stars vs. Incorporating sociopolitical themes, this show could go the distance (ie: Grace and Frankie)!!!"
9.0,2 September 2021,When Selena is in the scene your eyes will get fixed on her. She is an amazing talent. Martin and Short are spectacular as expected. The story is fun and interesting. I can't wait till the next episode. I love everything about it.
8.0,4 July 2022,"We decided to try this show out by starting season 1, episode 1 because: it featured Steve Martin and Martin Short and because of the biggest star of the show, New York City on location. Started out wonderful although in my opinion Selena Gomez didn't belong. Too bad Amy Ryan couldn't have had her part. But I digress; the language was too crude for our family. I later read the parents guide and found the F word was used over 80 times during the first 10 episodes. I have to ask; Why? Was it necessary to propel the plot? The policewoman using God's name to curse. Why? The city and the stars (minus Selena Gomez) would have been sufficient for us to watch and catch up with the episodes. You're right for thinking I'm just old fashioned but I believe no one would have noticed if there had been an absence of profanity given Steve Martin and Martin Short's talents not to mention having my favorite city as a backdrop."
7.0,28 August 2022,"I liked the Season 1 more and 2 became a bit cliched which is why a 7 else a 8 for Season 1.

Netflix needs to learn to make such series. Every thriller doesn't have to have grotesque scenes and a abuse scenario making it impossible to watch with your family.

This series was engrossing, had a thrill element, good locations, good story and cast.

The building is beautiful in its own way and the costumes were also quite pleasant though I kept wondering how does the lead character Mabel afford them as a jobless person.

Overall it works very well. Martin Short and the lady who plays the Bassoon were the best actors in the series.

They went a bit overboard in Season 2 and hope they tone it down in next season."
9.0,1 September 2021,I like the first 3 eps so much maybe because it's my favorite genre but their acting is so good too I know ALEX RUSSO feeling so proud right know the series gives a good vibe to me I love it.
6.0,1 April 2024,"A Murder Mystery drama sitcom driven by the Movie stars Matin Short and Steve Martin in the apartment building they live in with special guest stars appearing in the show to add extra flavour. Watch it if you have nothing better to do you could waste your time watching something much worse. The killer is not obvious so it is a true mystery.

There are 3 seasons to date with special guest within these that add flavour to the show to name a few Mathew Broadwick of feris buller and meryil streep and Sting the British Pop Star.

Selma Gomez is a great beautiful addition to the show she is the meat of the short and Martin sandwich.

There is no swearing No hardcore soft core sex scenes No nudity No violence or visually graphic scenes of murder its a mildly amusing sitcom tv show that is for over 13 year old. Watch it for the ageing Steve Martin."
1.0,1 September 2021,But I struggled to get through the first ep and tapped out in the second.
9.0,15 August 2023,"How does it keep getting better? I heard that Meryl Streep was the big guest star for this season and while I love her, I kind of thought 'Oh no, she's such a star, they'll put her ahead of the regular cast, she'll outshine everyone"". Well, wow. Of course she is PERFECT. And what a strange coincidence that in episode three, the theme runs to one particular actor outshining the others. Streep's performance, as an actor in a show within a show, was so poignant it left me in tears! Tears! Steve Martin, Marty Short and Selena Gomez are, as ever, perfection. The guys do a bit in ep 1 where they welcome her back, telling her she's what makes up their sandwich, that without her they are just two pieces of white bread. Great analogy - they are best together, no doubt.

In addition to the 'stars' of the show, we have the season's victim (no spoiler here, as it was revealed in the final episode of season 2), Paul Rudd. He's superbly cast in the role of Ben, who can be a jerk but underneath is a vulnerable guy who occasionally demonstrates a acting genius (in the show within a show), then reminds us why we thought he was a jerk.

And just like that, we are off on the latest crime solving adventure with the amateur sleuth/podcasters of Only Murders In The Building. Absolutely my favorite things on TV right now. 10 big stars."
10.0,11 September 2023,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. I want it to never end. It is so witty, silly and pure fun. I laugh so hard I snort just about every episode. Amazing cast, amazing writing, amazing acting. It is just pure guiltless fun. Even for the family. Do not be discouraged by the TV- MA rating. It's pretty much for the murder that you really don't see. It's honestly a fresh, fun show that pulls you in for more. Who did it, follow the clues. Try to guess. Either way it's so much fun to watch every week. LOVE LOVE LOVE everything about this show. Pluses watch and recommend to all of your friends. They will not be disappointed."
10.0,9 September 2022,"This feels like a low-key arty indulgence, but it has a wonderful comedic and addictive presence that worms and warms its way into your heart as the season(s) unfold.

Tenants in a building end up deep in a murder mystery and make a podcast about it.

The only thing that leaves me a little sad about this is that Steve Martin's energetic and hilarious comic genius is played down and suppressed, probably so everyone else has a chance to shine.

Selena Gomez really shines like the star she is. Such beautiful and natural talent. She plays a cynical and somewhat acerbic millennial that confounds the ageing characters of Steven Martin and Martin Short."
9.0,1 September 2021,"I'm finding it very difficult to understand the reviewers who choose to give this show 1,2,3... star ratings and call out Selena Gomez's acting. Selena Gomez is amazing in this show, as are Steve and Martin. I love the mystery surrounding the story, I love the acting, the comedy. This show deserves all the praise that it is getting. Can't wait for season 2!!!"
9.0,20 August 2022,"Great show if you are fun of mystery combined with comedy (hillarious scenes). Actors play well their characters which can be further built though. I think only Martin's character has been evolved more. If you liked ""Knives out"" and generally this kind of films, you will binge watch this too!"
10.0,11 August 2022,Great murder mystery with a heavy hitting cast. Tons a laughs and gags exactly on par with Martin Short. It's enjoyable enough just to see the cast all in one show with such a high budget. But the story has twists and turns that really keep the audience guessing. A ton of fun characters and new faces throughout the building too.
6.0,15 March 2022,"I love the entire series. I wanted to give 8/10, too bad the ending ruined it for me. It was silly. I know this is a comedy-crime show and it supposed to be silly, but not like that, wasn't funny at all. It doesn't matter if there will be a Season 2 and we'll see how they are after being arrested. It's still gonna be silly."
10.0,5 September 2022,"Martin short is absolutely brilliant, Steve Martin is awesome.. but why what who Salena Gomez doing in this? She truly can't act. It would have been wonderful to have a feminine woman play the part - it would have been so much fun with the 2 oldies but instead we have a tomboy boring one-facial expression gomez. Really really REALLY poor casting chosing selena gomez. Her voice is deeper than the men in the show (howard? Lol) - it detracts from the show, but we endure as it might be medical. Anyway, i still enjoyed the show and give it a seven out of ten, would have been more without gomez - she's definitely off my to-watch list!"
7.0,23 August 2022,"I originally decided to watch this solely because Steve Martin was in it with the bonus of Martin Short. I was worried when I saw Selena Gomez was part of the cast. Not because I had any particular issue with her I just had never seen her acting before and her music is not my preference.

As it turns out it those three work beautifully together. Don't expect an out an out comedy, and don't expect the most taxing thriller. What we do get is a gentle comedic mystery that leaves you with a big smile on your face at the end of each episode together with a little teaser of what's to come. It draws you in and makes you yearn for the next episode. I've seen a review where a minor gripe was the length of the episodes. I see the point because you are always left wanting more. However, most podcasts are released in short but size episodes and this replicates that feel.

Bear in mind it is an homage to True Crime podcasts and not intended to be a Complex thriller though you do need to pay attention to keep up with the twists. A regular flow different characters, of guest stars, some appearing as themselves, keeps it fresh. This is one of my favourite things out there at the moment and am really pleased it looks like there will be a series 3.

It's close to a 10/10 but a few red herrings are a bit too obvious. Then again that may be deliberate."
2.0,22 January 2022,"This show has a great premise, talented people and a good setting. Unfortunately, the writing could have been better. You get the feeling there was a lot of improvisation. A lot of the bits could have been brilliant but went another way. It's still worth watching. I've watched five episodes and will watch the rest.

As far as where to watch it, these are options as of late January 2022. It's a Hulu original series so you could subscribe and watch it there, but they ask for your birthday and gender. Your birthday is sensitive information and none of their business. Once I gave a fake birthday to another nosy company. They reported it to a credit bureau and caused some issues.

Due to this, I tried subscribing to Disney+ because they said they had this series. That was a waste of time. First it was hard to tell which subscriptions had it. I guessed. AFTER they got my money I learned I had to download an app. Then I still had to sign up for Hulu. The Hulu sign up process malfunctioned. It might have demanded my gender and birthday but I never got that far.

Amazon doesn't currently have this series. That would have been my preference and to watch it on a browser/internet instead of downloading. And no App."
10.0,22 December 2021,"This show is so boring. Combining 2 genres which dont go together. The dialogues and acting is too cliche, comic timing completely off, characters unidimensional. Exciting moments-zero."
10.0,11 September 2023,"So to be clear, I am not from New York, Not from the US, over 30 and not a Selena Stan. This series is absolutely brilliant and really does something differentn IMO. The 3 main cast members worked well together and I found that surprising with one of them Selena Gomez. The additional ensemble cast is excellent and they have some really gem parts. Normally I find certain series can't hold a story like this for the whole set of episodes, but this definitely does. Just started the 2nd series and am looking forward to it. Martin, Short and Gomez really have pulled this together and made themselves look very good. The writing has also been an extremely important part of the success and lifted some of the support characters out of just being there for dressing."
9.0,20 September 2022,"We love this show! It is intelligent, funny, and full of surprises. The writing and acting have us continually coming back for more. We are big Bulldogge fans and love seeing the adorable dog! The combination of Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez is brilliant. The amount of incredible actors in the supporting cast enriches the constant twists and turns. Everyone is complicated and complex, this show does a great job of showing people in their best and worst moments and all of the in-between. Every episode is another reason to stay up way too late and keep watching. Once it gets to the end of the season, it's depressing while waiting for the next."
9.0,19 September 2023,
10.0,17 November 2021,"I love the interaction between Steve Martin and Martin Short, and was honestly surprised by how much I liked Selena Gomez's character. Great plot twists, kept we watching all 10 episodes in about 1 week. Another season please!"
8.0,18 December 2021,"Laugh out funny, proving why Steve Martin and Martin Short are huge stars. Selena Gomez brings the youth and is the perfect choice being a genuine person. Perfect casting all round.

It's gentle comedy with a whole lot of ""normal"" language - anyone complaining, have you been to NY? Have you left your house recently? The script is sharp, witty, and delivered across the board by the great actors.

There's an air of Arrested Development around this, but for a US comedy, to actually be genuinely laugh out loud funny... a very rare thing indeed. It's in a very short list."
7.0,4 October 2022,"Both seasons are really good , i enjoyed the second one more though.

Characters and story is very well written. Lead trio is so good, as well the secondary characters.

Comedy and thriller is very well balanced in both seasons.

Really excited for next season. Show keeps you on the edge till finale episode in both seasons.

I also liked the story telling in every episodes feels so fresh .

Do watch it whenever you get chance, episodes are not that much long, so it feels convenient too .

Steve and martin sir with Selena is team to watch out for. I don't want to spoil the show , go watch it and judge it yourself."
10.0,14 September 2021,"You might see high ratings and posters everywhere but this is not a super good show or even a great one. I'll say it's average, good production, questionable artistic touch, light and sometimes fun. I'm at episode 3 and will not continue."
6.0,23 August 2022,"This has to be one of the best shows that I've watched in quite some time! It has mystery, murder, dark comedy and Steve Martin and Martin Short! Along with Selena Gomez who is the ""smartest"" one of the bunch, this trio just works! Along with the others that live in the building, and wondering if ""they done it"", you're in for quite a ride!!"
1.0,3 July 2022,"Good story, whitty and fun. Surprise actors appear and disappear, really big big stars, fast, fun, unexpected. Odd combo but it works. I like how stats just show up. Surprise. Mystery, funny, whacky. People are trying to commit a murder, in the building."
9.0,10 September 2021,
9.0,19 October 2022,"Only Murders in the building is really good. It is funny,thrilling . Good story. Really loved Selena Gomez . Martin short and Steve Martin is really good throughout the series. Became a huge fan of both of them The entire cast is great. This has become my favorite show. The season 2 actually bought the vibe of Agatha Christie. This mysterious series is wonderful. Every episodes has a twist at the end .I love every minute of the show. This show is never tiring . I am waiting for another season.such fun! Really enjoyed the season 3. Fun,creative techniques are used. The director has also down an amazing job."
9.0,23 August 2022,"This series is perfection and I have to give it my only ever 10. Most people enjoy classic detective stories such as Agatha Christie or Hardy Boys. This series deliberately pays homage to elements from these stories but mixes it with humorous characters and modern settings. The beautiful building, and the secrets it hides, is a perfect way to tie everything together.

Mixing the old hands of Steve Martin and Martin Short with younger actors was a master stroke to widen the appeal of this series. The gentle digs at the misunderstandings between the generations is especially lovely without being disrespectful.

Looking forward to series 3. My suggestion is to limit the show to 3 series so they don't over milk it."
10.0,10 January 2024,"""Only Murders in the Building"" seems like a really strange combination of elements - actors I would not have thought to put together (except for Steve Martin and Martin Short, of course), genres* I would not have thought to put together, but the elements all come together to create a very unique and interesting show. Thank you for showing ""Only Murders in the Building"" on ABC and for starting at the beginning. I really like it so far. By the way, I have not seen justification for the TV-MA rating so far. Oh, maybe the profanity but it is censored.

*I'm not even sure which genre I'd put it in."
10.0,8 November 2021,"Nice drama, nice mystery, nice twists, and JUST ENOUGH comedy made this an absolute winner. I thoroughly enjoyed each episode, and highly recommend! Honestly I am not a giant Steve Martin/Martin Short lover, but they were great in this and so was Selena Gomez. Didn't figure out the killer until episode 8."
10.0,2 August 2022,"A different series from the usual cliches. The series makes you wait for the next episode when it's especially with a twist of murder mystery and comedy drama.

The episode ""flipping pieces"" where it shows the past of Mabel was one of the best episodes in season 2."
7.0,20 March 2024,"""Only Murders in the Building"" embarks on a delightful journey, blending fantastic writing, surprising chemistry among the leads, and well-developed supporting characters. With high production values and witty dialogue peppered with slapstick humor, it promises an enjoyable watch.

Season 1 introduces us to a trio of murder-podcast aficionados investigating a homicide in their upscale apartment building. Steve Martin and Martin Short shine with their comedic prowess, complemented by Selena Gomez's refreshing performance. Despite Gomez's nasal voice, the trio's dynamic keeps viewers engaged, making the series binge-worthy.

The first season captures the essence of New York City with its quirky characters and witty banter. It's a light-hearted romp with a sprinkling of mystery and drama, reminiscent of classic comedy-mystery series like ""Monk"" and ""Jonathan Creek."" While not groundbreaking, it offers good, honest fun that earns its 9-star rating.

However, Season 2 struggles to recapture the magic, stumbling with clumsy humor and a jarring guest appearance by Amy Schumer. Although it eventually finds its footing, it treads familiar ground, failing to match the originality of its predecessor.

Season 3, unfortunately, sinks further, losing its charm and coherence. Steve Martin's character becomes caricatured, and Selena Gomez's performance lacks the spark of earlier seasons. The once-engaging mystery devolves into nonsensical motives, leaving viewers disappointed.

Despite its uneven trajectory, ""Only Murders in the Building"" remains a commendable effort, buoyed by its standout first season. While subsequent seasons may falter, the series' initial brilliance ensures it's a must-watch for fans of comedy mysteries, offering a tantalizing blend of suspense, humor, and quirky characters."
10.0,22 September 2021,"It's nothing ground breaking but its highly likeable and amusing stuff with a relatively intriguing murder mystery that has kept me coming back for more. What makes the show though is the chemistry and banter between real life long term buddies Steve Martin & Martin Short. They clearly had a great deal of fun making this which shows through in the final product.

The only thing that I wasn't sure about is who exactly they are aiming this at ? It would be quite a family friendly show if it wasn't for the ton of swearing in it."
7.0,19 February 2022,"A local comedian mentioned it on a podcast, I heard Steve Martin and thought: ""meh, I'll give it a try"".

So here I am, 3 AM, mind blown, wishing I could unsee it so I could watch it again for the first time."
2.0,8 August 2023,"After season 1: I've enjoyed this more at beginning than towards the end. It was more endearing following true crime aficionados getting things hilariously wrong, while lying through their teeth to their tight-knit buddies. Branching one mystery into three was too ambitious and the branches resolved in sort of predictable ways. Each story was cut abruptly as a result. The trio got too competent (or lucky) to my taste, saving the day all by themselves. Some parts were funny and some were forced. I also wasn't entirely swept by acting. The characters never break their mold. Selena is too mild for snarky young woman set on uncovering the truth."
10.0,24 September 2021,"Boy was I disappointed. Steve Martin did a superb job of publicizing this one. It does not even vaguely live up to the hype. The story is simply not that interesting and moves unbearably slowly.

The part for Martin Short seem to be made up just so he would have part of his friend Steve Martins film. I made it thru E 4 and just quit."
9.0,30 September 2021,"Not meaning to diss ""Steve Martin Short"", but I didn't expect too much from this. But I am pleasantly surprised at how good it is. Well written, good acting by the ""Martin's"" and especially by Selena Gomez. It's no Soprano's, but definitely worth watching. Give it a try!"
8.0,23 August 2022,"I'm very particular about series I watch, really all TV in general. I was delighted to find Only Murders in the Building when it started. I found myself waiting more and more eagerly each week for the newest episode and went full withdrawal waiting for season 2. I love the twists and that the story line isn't obvious. I do hope the series continues because you've got two legends with Martin and Short, a beautiful blossoming actress with Gomez, complete gems with Lane, Randolph and Creighton. The entire cast, with the exception of Schumer, are all great. Sorry, I've never seen any work by Schumer that I can stomach. She's just not what I call a skilled actress. Kudos to Martin and Hoffman for such a brilliant series. Wishing you success for years ahead. I know the great Steve Martin is retiring but I do hope it's not too soon, the series would not be the same.

For those reviewing Gomez as being too monotone and boring, have you watched the series? If so, you should realize, this is the persona of her character and with reason. She's acing it. Her character is not some chipper, high strung millennial. The character has been through a lot and is very deep, much mature for her age. So give Gomez a break, she is nailing the character 100%."
9.0,18 November 2021,"In the beginning, when Selena came on the scene, her prophanity was ridiculous! Thankfully it got better. The show is fun. Well worth watching. Like all movies and shows, the mains get listed as exec producers for even more money! The experienced actors, I can easily see they have great input, but Selena? Please... She didn't ruin the show so I do recommend!"
9.0,4 September 2021,Selena's acting as Mabel Mora proves that she can take any role and eat it DOWN ! Oliver and Charles' characters go hand-in-hand with Mabel's character to fill a void between various generations of audience This show is better than expected tbh and the scriptwriters and costume designing dept did their job perfectly.
9.0,4 October 2023,"One of the best shows I have seen these last years! Selena Gomez is one hell of a great actress! Her role as Mabel is what makes the Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), Charled-Haden Savage (Steve Martin) and Mabel Mora (Selena) a fantastic trio of goofy funny investigators.

The stories are brilliantly written. Always surprising and never boring. The secondary actors and actresses are amazing and bring so much depth to the whole combination. Having Meryl Streep, Jackie Hoffman, Jayne Houdyshell, Tina Fey or Jane Lynch (just to name a few) to complete this already great casting, makes the show one of the most refreshing serie to watch.

Highly recommended!"
7.0,31 August 2021,
8.0,25 December 2021,"The story is actually quite good as murder mysteries go, taking you on a journey before finally revealing what truly happened. I found the characters annoying to begin with and wasn't sure about the chemistry between them but they grew on me over the course of the season and I would happily watch more.

I personally wasn't a fan of The Boy from 6B episode (clearly a very divisive episode looking at the reviews) which is done almost entirely through sign language or through alternate means of dialogue (such as scrabble words or texting). I get what they were going for as the focus of the episode is on a deaf guy and there is nothing wrong with being more inclusive of people with disabilities but the silence feels forced in some scenes where it makes no sense not to talk and above all it's a TV show and this episode was not as entertaining as it should have been because of the lack of sound."
7.0,5 September 2022,"This show is very well done. Season 2 is even better than 1. Each episode keeps you captivated until the end and then you want to binge the whole season. I'm a big fan of the main actors and they deliver above and beyond with their excellent acting skills depicting quirky characters that get caught in various crazy situations (spoiler: murders). I don't think there is one ""normal"" character in the show but that is what makes it so memorable and hilarious. It's hard to define what category this falls into... Comedy/Mystery/Suspense, with a little bit of romance. It can be dark at times as the characters sort their way out of the catastrophes, but there is enough humor to lighten it. Can't wait for Season 3!"
5.0,19 February 2023,"Had no idea this existed until the gf wanted something similar to Knives Out and Clue. Over the course of a few weeks we watched season 1 (very solid, worth the current review score) and season 2 (sloppy mess, feels more like a 4 star).

Season 2 review: Dont bother. The ending is almost pointless and feels like a rushed re-write when everyone realized who the REAL killer was supposed to be by episode 6. It feels obvious by the script, as well as Selena Gomez's massive weight changes throughout, that the second season went through massive reshoots, to its detriment. The only highlights are really Steve Martin and Martin Short hamming it up.

Season 1 review: Steve Martin and Martin Short are back together with the same chemistry they had in the old days. My gf, having only just having seen Three Amigos for the first time shortly before we learned about this, commented on the duo's comedy chops, which are still quite strong. Selena Gomez, unfortunately, is far more one note in all of her acting. Her speaking mannerism is this odd grumbly flatness and she rarely shows emotion or acting range and often just stands there and says her lines in her flat, monotone voice. Shes not exactly BAD, but she definitely is not good. Her lack of acting make Steve Martin and Martin Short shine by comparison. The trio stumble their way into each others otherwise secluded lives via their shared love of true crime podcasts. The story is engaging and often fun and funny, though there are also some very 'real' moments sprinkled throughout.

The first season gave us enough information to go on that you could absolutely figure out whodunit, while throwing in ample red herrings to throw you off the scent.

No such luck for the second season when it feels like the revealed killer comes out of the blue, and feels messy and disjointed.

There will inevitably be a season 3, and I hope that they have a better script than what they put us through from season 2."
8.0,9 September 2021,"The show would have had potential, but the cast is very much confusing to me as well as the whole Selena Gomez' on-screen career. The girl obviously can't act. Every scene with her makes me cringe. The story could be better, the jokes could be wittier and funnier. It's just not good. I could barely finish two episodes."
8.0,12 August 2022,Honestly I wasn't too sure about this when I first watched it but it hooked me so I decided to continue. Then came season two and by the first episode my socks were blown off and they flew around the world! I now love this show and put it as one of my favs.
9.0,25 August 2022,"Only halfway through season 2 but it is great so far.

The backstory and relationships that are established in the first season provide depth and a nice segway into the 2nd.

Witty, suspenseful and intriguing. Thoroughly enjoying it."
9.0,11 August 2023,I must say I find this show fascinating and entertaining. However that said the amount of foul language feels excessive and completely unnecessary. I do not feel it caters to or benefits the storylines in any way whatsoever! I'm not sure why they felt this was more entertaining because it rather feels offensive and turns a fun show into something a bit too crude. It (in my personal opinion) distracts from the story so much I almost cringe when the characters do it now. I think I personally would have lived the show had it not had the use of offensive language! I still enjoy it don't get me wrong. I just don't think it was necessary for good storytelling.
10.0,17 October 2023,"I mean Selena Gomez can be very sexually attractive but she doesn't need to be another female ""objects"" under male gaze like those ""Bond's girls"". She turned out to be a quirky female lead who earns her place in the series by her intelligence not her look, and sometimes she gets to take charge. She also doesn't need to do nude scenes to attract eyeballs! How good is that!

Also this show is funny, makes musical theater addicts very happy and contains strong human themes. Although the crimes and motives themselves are usually flawed but who cares about that? I'm not here to watch Criminal Minds anyway."
10.0,26 August 2022,"The first season of Only Murders in The Building was great. It was funny, well paced and tense at points. Season 2 was fine, everything between the first and last episode of the season was painfully slow. Hopefully season 3 retains the magic of season 1."
7.0,13 March 2022,"Web Series review: Only Murders in a building ( streaming on Disney+ Hotstar) #sanjuzzreviews #DisneyPlusHotstar #OnlyMurdersInTheBuilding Three strangers, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez living in the same building, who are also ardent true crime afficinados find themselves in the middle of a real murder mystery when there is a grizzly death in one of the apartments. The bumbling trio jump headlong into the investigation and try to find out the truth. Will they unmask the killer, especially when they themselves have secrets of their own and are not entirely truthful with one another.

Only Murders In The Building is a mysterious, funny, intriguing and completely addictive series. It is not a show to be watched without your attention being on it. At the same time it is light hearted and humourous too. The lead cast is great and their witty one-liners are not to be missed. This one's a rare blend of a murder mystery and humor put together and the result is pure magic.

The series has 10 episodes, each having a runtime of around 30 mins. Highly recommended weekend binge-watch option and eagerly waiting for season 2.

3.5/5 from me for this one ...adios üôÇ"
10.0,12 January 2024,"I'm one of those viewers who tuned in for the cast. The first trailer looked fun and promised nostalgia. If you loved Murder She Wrote, they claimed, you would fall in love with OMITB, too. And the first episode really did it for me, it sparked an interest. The rest of the season then and its conclusion was often a bit too much for my taste. And yet I tuned in for season 2. The cast, you know... and an initial plot that had me hooked once again. Funny enough, as I'm typing this now, I don't actually remember what the story or who the culprit was in the end. And there's a reason for that: the way that season ended. It really left me wanting more. And the way they wrapped up that new case in season 3? Absolutely fabulous. That season is truly my favorite! The cast (as always with some wonderful additions to the main trio), the setting, the songs, the humor and yet another finale that has me waiting for the next season with glee. Such a slow burn sensation for me. For others it was an immediate hit and I'm truly grateful for that."
7.0,13 May 2024,"Do you have that one friend who's obsessed with true crime podcasts and can't resist a good murder mystery? Well, imagine if they got caught up in a real-life murder investigation. That's pretty much the premise of Only Murders in the Building.

The show features Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as an unlikely trio of amateur sleuths. Steve Martin and Martin Short are like a comedy duo sent from the heavens, and Selena Gomez adds a fresh sense of humor and intrigue to the mix. It's like the ultimate '80s sitcom teamed up with a modern pop sensation to solve crimes. This sitcom takes place in a swanky apartment building in New York City, and the residents are like a who's who of eccentric neighbors.

The story unfolds when this trio of unlikely detectives decides to create their own true crime podcast to investigate a murder that happens in their building. But as they dive deeper into the mystery, they uncover more and more secrets. The plot is a rollercoaster of laughs, suspense, and unexpected turns. Only Murders in the Building is a delightful blend of mystery and comedy that keeps you guessing until the very end. It's like a good old-fashioned murder mystery with a comedic twist. So, if you're looking for a show that's as funny as it is mysterious, and as quirky as your weirdest neighbor, give it a shot."
5.0,24 July 2022,"Such a lighthearted show. The atmosphere is amazing and gentle, the setting of the Arconia is impeccable and the costume/set design is just on point. Each character's outfit describes them perfectly and allows you to better understand their persona and their part in the story.

The participation of both Martins and Selena also helps to build the warmth feeling of the show. Regarding the story itself, it didn't sweep me off my feet yet. It's a promising show, specially for the vibes."
9.0,27 March 2023,"This was a pretty interesting show in season 1, but after season 2 it was not as great.

The series features a cast of diverse characters with their own unique personalities and motivations, which helps to keep things interesting. However, the pacing can sometimes be a bit slow, and the twists and turns can be a bit predictable.

That being said, the show does have some redeeming qualities. The production values are solid, and the atmosphere of the party-turned-murder-scene is well-crafted. The show also captures the essence of a murder mystery party pretty well, with clues hidden throughout the scenes and red herrings sprinkled throughout the plot.

In conclusion, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a decent murder mystery series that may be worth checking out if you're a fan of the genre. If you're looking for a light-hearted and entertaining show that doesn't require too much concentration, this may be a good option. However, if you're looking for something truly groundbreaking or deeply thought-provoking, you may want to keep looking."
8.0,19 October 2021,"This isn't the 10/10 that some ppl have made it out to be but it's not even the low marks that it has been given.

There is certain type of noir something you would have possibly seen in the early 40s/50s movies to it.

Each character had their own arc and niche.. A great cliff hanger at the end.

Bring on season 2."
9.0,10 August 2022,"Loved this series, was fun and with a greattt cast.

Super funny to watch a ""Sherlock Holmes"" series with this trio, the characters developing was really well made too, to sumup was a great first serie for me!"
8.0,5 October 2021,"What a fun show. Love the cast and the storyline. I totally recommend watching it, there are not many shows that grab my attention so fast."
8.0,17 September 2022,"A witty and breezy comedy, perfectly executed, with a well written story and full of twists you cannot expect, but what keeps you hooked the most is the wholesomeness of Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez. Their chemistry is something amazing. Actually, the second season gets even better as the mystery keeps you on your toes. I just love how all the characters work perfectly together. Even though some episodes may seem sluggish to some people, as you get to know the characters better the curiosity grows. Looking forward to the third season. This show is much more than just murder mystery."
9.0,23 October 2022,Fantastic cast but I can't believe the producers/writers didn't write Selena Gomez out in season two. She absolutely ruins the entire show. Her acting is so awful. Every time she speaks in her monotone voice I cringe. She has zero emotion and feeling in her acting and next two extremely talented actors/actresses she sticks out like a sore thumb. Steve Martin and Martin Short have stellar performances and the story line is very compelling. It's just such a shame they gave her a main role and so much air time. Maybe in season three they'll be able to get rid of her so we can actually enjoy the show.
7.0,13 August 2022,"Many shows these days are have this weird, cheap tint to everything about it. It might be the curse of the streaming age, and will lead to people losing interest in low quality mass-produced garbage with over-paid A-listers. Which is why I rarely watch shows anymore - enter Only murders in the building.

This rare gem of a show mixes humour and mystery. Weather or not, this is ¬´your kinda show¬ª, you must accknowledge the objective quality of this show - the sets, the lighting, the characters, the ever-moving plot, references, acting and costumes. My absolute favourite show of the last 15 years.

My only hope is that it wraps up before it becomes too much of a messy scramble, and that it can tie up loose end, or even better, end on a few cliff hangers. Well done to everyone involved, this is an instant classic!"
10.0,3 February 2022,"I'm not a fan of podcasts or true crime but I loved it his show.

It is one of the better shows out now.

The chemistry between Martin Short and Gomez is great and shows on screen.

A fun ride waiting for season two."
7.0,4 May 2023,"This trio of main characters are such a delight to watch. The writing is witty, clever, and smart. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez are brilliant together and deliver each line with perfection. The chemistry between them is amazing. Not to mention the phenomenal guest stars each season. The setting is a character all its own. Between the enchanting building itself and the magic and aesthetic of New York City, it embraces and encompasses, wrapping everything up into a cozy, comedic mystery. The stories are engaging and the twists are always a surprise and fun to watch unfold. The end of each season leaves you wanting more."

10.0,3 July 2022,"I loved the 1st season, and I was excited for 2nd season. But after a couple of episodes it's clear this show is falling short of the original creativity, going off on unnecessary tangents. The cast of supported characters also falls short, with the acting level not very convincing. I think the 2nd season is disappointing compared to the 1st so far, hopefully maybe they can get back on track."
10.0,17 July 2022,Who doesn't love Steve Martin and Martin Short together?! The casting and writing are excellent! Somehow Season 2 is better Season 3 and I seriously cannot wait until the next episode comes out!
9.0,1 November 2021,"I really enjoyed this series-yep, Steve Martin still has it! But you know what bugged me? On the first episode you have the 3 main characters going up to their apartments in the elevator together, and Martin Short exits first. The series' intro, however, shows Steve Martin BELOW Martin Short in the building's windows. I know, a strange thing to mention in a review, but hey, it's an inconsistency that bothered me on every episode. Otherwise, fabulous writing and acting so a big thumb's up!"
8.0,21 October 2021,"This is the best series I've watched in a long time! If you love murder mysteries, comedies and a stellar cast, this one's for you. Steve Martin as dried up actor, Charles Hayden-Savage and Martin Short as disgraced director, Oliver Putnam, play off of each other beautifully and provide some legit LOL moments in season one. At first, Selena Gomez seemed like an odd choice. But she grows on you as she accurately portrays the depressed and cynical millennial, Mabel Mora. The series isn't perfect though. For instance, true crime aficionados who keep touching vital evidence without gloves will make you cringe. Also, the choice of narrator for each episode doesn't always make sense. However, the writing and the acting are the best I've seen in a long time. The quality makes me think of a blockbuster film rather than a 30 minute show. Everyone has their own tastes and opinion, but if you are the type of person who appreciates great writing, talented actors or just a cozy mystery, you'll enjoy Only Murders in the Building."

9.0,19 October 2021,"I waited until I knew it was getting close to the final episode and then binged it over 2 days. I think that helped me enjoy it as much as I did because I didn't have to wait. I'm not a big fan of Selena Gomez but her character started growing on me in the last few episodes. I love Steve Martin and Martin Short so they are the reason I wanted to watch and I enjoyed watching them have fun. Of course, now I have to wait for the second season, but I will be looking forward to it."
7.0,30 March 2023,
9.0,27 March 2024,"For me by far the highlight of this is Martin Short. In series 1 and 2 he's simply dazzling, series 3 still decently good.

Steve Martin has good chemistry with him but he feels either a bit flat or a bit 2D. Just a dash of 1970s/1980s Martin to pep things up would have made such a difference.

Everyone else has their moment(s) but they really feel like glue connecting Short and Martin.

When the glue is strong, as it is in season 1, the show is excellent. There are clunky sections (especially episode 1) but the show just zings along frothily. Very enjoyable.

Season 2 the glue isn't quite as strong and it feels to me like too many hands wee involved, muddying things and so detracting from that central pair.

Season 3 was really disappointing, the joint screen time not enough to make the show more than ""interesting, should have been better"", and the side stars simply distracting. Short also seems flatter, less energetic.

I hope they don't make a season 4 and dilute things yet more.

If they want to do anything, please make it one off specials or movies, kept nice and tight and really, really focus on keeping the 3 on screen together."

5.0,17 August 2023,"I absolutely love this genre and only murders in the building does exactly what it's meant to . It's fun and camp and silly and the plots just keep getting better and better . Season two was brilliant . It goes into all the typical murder mystery themes , cast of suspects , theatre , murder mystery parties . I just love love love it . Season three opens with a murder in stage how perfect and the addition of some big name faces ... just feel like yiu can stitch of and become absorbed in the fun ... the mysteries are always complex and you just have to follow along for all the clues as they do . Love this show."
10.0,24 August 2022,"Short and Martin are close friends, but their onscreen chemistry sucks, and that's nothing new.

Ms. Gomez saves this show. Anyone watching Steve Martins early movies knows what he can do. This is not it."
9.0,5 January 2022,It's hard to understand how she was cast. They wanted someone young with a following? I didn't know anything about her except she used to sing and now I know that she really can not act at all. It's kinda of embarrassing.
10.0,2 September 2021,"I really enjoy the plot line, characters, and production of this TV show! This show has several stars that make the show great.

8.0,1 September 2021,Selenagomez proved that she is one of the best best actress in the world. The story is very interesting.
10.0,23 October 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of Selena Gomez's acting. She deserves an award for her nuanced portrayal of Mabel. She is also a singer and a dancer, not to mention an accomplished businesswoman. Is there anything Selena can't do?

Steve Martin and Martin Short also shine throughout this comedy series that has a heart. It was very poignant at times and I almost shed a tear. A big one. I enjoyed the series and I am looking forward to the second season. That type of shows that mix comedy and drama provide much needed escape for a lot of people around the world."

7.0,13 October 2022,"Only Murders in the Building is one of the best shows ever! My children & I have waited anxiously every Tuesday for the next chapter, have thought about the plot all week long, all the different possibilities, and have really ""lived"" this show. We can't wait for season 3! The cast is all excellent, brilliant, funny, cool, and the writing is absolutely superb. Suspense, friendship, Manhattan, murder (of course), family, theatre, art, different generations, romance, many interestingly well-written characters, a fantastic plot, and wonderful music: all in one terrific awesome show. Bravo to all! Thanks a lot for this masterpiece! Please make 100 more seasons."
10.0,1 February 2024,"SO i had been wanting to watch this show for a while having not watched much on Hulu but I decided to watch The Bear after all the success that show had received and loved it and needed something more light hearted after that so I thought id try ONLY MURDERS IN THE BUILDING. And I just loved this show!

The characters are really well written and although its based around the three main characters it really does have a good ensemble cast that add new additions each season. Howard is defiantly a standout. Bunny and Uma are also great, and I love how they flesh out the characters and they aren't just there for the sake of it.

Sometimes they do glaze over certain things, which I do find a little annoying, but its usually basic things like why is that character there, because before they were in jail etc. (not saying who to avoid spoilers)

I also love how inclusive this show is without hitting you over the head with it. I would like to see more from the podcast fans cause they are funny and add a fun angle to the stories. Its so rare to see a person in a wheelchair on tv so its nice that you have a show with deaf, physically disabled and what seems like a few mental health issues characters in a show and it not be about their disabilities.

I do find it fun that the murder mysteries are always twists but not ones that you find unbelievable.

This show has made me laugh out loud multiple times which is rare for comedy shows but it just keeps up in quality. I hope this show does end with the next one. Why? Because i think it will get stale if they mare more, and end it when its on a high. Learn from the british, we end our best shows after 2-3 seasons of usually 6 episodes. Don't go on till people say, ""oh it was great till season 3!"" End on a high!"
6.0,27 March 2022,Gomez is definately a miscasting!wooden acting at best that is highlighted by the excellent acting of the two Martins that are at their best game in years!
2.0,4 September 2022,"Love the premise, the story line and the talented, colorful cast! Love the setting and the scenery. It is a fun series with amusing twists and turns. The many, varied, quirky characters are portrayed by outstanding actors overall. Of course Martin and Short are superb!

Unfortunately Selena Gomez spoils the show with her bad acting. She is flat, flat, flat!!!

Whenever she's in a scene, she pulls the watcher out of the story because she is not believable as a character. You realize you're watching Selena Gomez give a sub par performance. It is painful to watch.

Mabel could be a strong, interesting, clever character."
9.0,21 August 2022,"Three very different people, in a half-imagined investigation of a - you guessed it - murder in their NYC apartment building.

Twists, slides, sideslips, and poor decisions make for a dark comedy. The wide spectrum of oddball characters adds humor and tragedy. Heartily recommend this, accompanied by a good Pinot."
10.0,10 September 2022,"This series has interesting characters and a compelling concept, and it moves forward at a leisurely yet engaging pace. However, the MA-rated components (mostly F-words and some sexual content) and the progressive content seem inorganic, and they detract from what otherwise be very engaging and entertaining. Perhaps series with a TV-14 rating aren't moving the dial any more, so the producers feel compelled to toss in a boatload of gratuitous F-bombs, progressive sexuality, and (as one example) creepy conversations among senior adults about sex toys. But, to me at least, these elements seem artificially added in order to merit that ""coveted"" rating of MA. This series could easily have been TV-14. It would have been the better for it, and its audience might have expanded. Aspects of it are still quite enjoyable, but on the whole, ""Only Murders in the Building"" strikes me as a great concept sullied in pursuit of vulgarity."
9.0,22 July 2022,I thought the first season was pretty fun but I never even made it through the first episode of the second season. I'm not really sure where they were going with everything but it didn't seem like the same sort of mystery story going on like the first season. I wound up turning it off with the introduction of Cara Delevingne's character. Just really was awkward and didn't seem to add anything to the series.
9.0,25 February 2024,"I relate and love Oliver! He's so funny!

I really enjoy this black humor. This is a great series with great actors! Not one is out of place for casting! It separates the rest of the other mystery shows and movies when you add humor into it. Selma has brought her inner dark Alex Larusso out a bit. I love Martin short and Steve Martin! These two have great chemistry with humor. I hope this show never ends! This is better than ""You"".

The opposite character mannerisms reflect the fun in the show. Having same characteristics in every character is boring. This show doesn't disappoint in that region."
9.0,13 August 2022,"Only Murders in the building follows a trio of tenants as they try to solve a murder that took place in their building.

I was not at all expecting to like this first season as much as I did. The show was something I looked at but was never really interested in, I saw it as more of a parody of sorts so it didn't appeal to me. That being said when I saw a critic I deeply respect praise the second season I figured I should give it a go.

What I like most about the first season is the mix of genres. This is through and through a dramedy, but it takes that genre and blends it with a murder mystery so not only does it take you on a roller coaster of emotions it continuously keeps you guessing at who killed Tim Kono.

The core trio of Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez have some of the best on screen group chemistry I've seen in a modern day show. Each one of them plays off of the other extremely well and it's a lot of fun to watch.

In terms of gripes I don't really have many, the only thing that slightly annoyed me was that their were certain subplots, that I feel could've been explored more so that when they came to and end it would've felt more earned.

Overall ""Only Murders in the Building"" season 1 is fantastic. With a stacked cast and a extremely talented group of writers this show is far better than I expected.

9/10 A.

After another murder occurs in the building our core trio are under the spotlight as the prime suspects

This season is just as good as the first and honestly I feel the exact same way as I did the for the first season, so I'll keep this short.

The core trio of Selena Gomez, Martin Short, and Steve Martin are what make this show their chemistry is off the charts and it's awesome to watch.

The story unfolds in a very well structured manner. The twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat while the character development is strong throughout.

This show does have a theme of underdeveloped subplots which isn't a big deal because they are subplots but something to mention.

Overall season to is just as good as season 1. It's filled with great chemistry and quality writing.

9/10 A."
8.0,4 January 2024,"1-3-24 I haven't laughed this much in a long time. Martin Short and Steve Martin together in a show, OMG! They are hilarious. We need more shows like this that make you laugh. I hadn't seen Selena Gomez much. She really does a great job in this series. She knows how to handle the two neurotic and self-centered comedy duo and she plays her part very well. She is funny, serious , beautiful and lovely all at the same time. It's a unique show, there is so much funny stuff, and hilarious antics yet murders are taking place and the murder investigations are very intense and serious in their process. So you have both things going on. Martin Short and Steve Martin are amazing, they shine through with their incredible comedy. They are so funny, true actors who have withstood time and no one could do what they are doing, they are great! I have watched all three seasons and can't wait for more. Every season had intricate and complex story plots and anyone could be a suspect with the quirky, neurotic and crazy people that they come across every day. You keep trying to guess who did but something keeps leading you to another and another. WOW! Really keeps you guessing. Great writing for sure. Can't wait for season 4. UPDATE: 1-4-24 I agree with some of the other reviewers Amy Schumer really was terrible in this show. I have no idea why they thought she would be a good fit. Couldn't wait til she was done and Cara. Delevingne was not a good fit either. There are so many other wonderful actors and/or comedians who would have been a much better choice."
6.0,27 July 2022,"Why does everyone say Selena Gomez is so great in this? I am sure she is a very nice person and people want her to succeed and all that, but she is definitely the weakeat link. Monotone dialog, emotionless face. Unless they make her the killer in the end, which she is not, I can not honestly in good concious say she does a good job, she does not, and this has been obvious to me from the first episode. The actress playing Steve Martins daughter is a way better actress IMO."
9.0,7 November 2023,"Some other reviews are a bit overboard and have no substance. My personal view on this series is it kept me calm and relaxed at difficult times In my life. I love Steve Martin, the cast are great and the synergy is on point. I love the story of each season, the calming music and funny lines. I feel like many of the characters resonate with our own lives at some point, I'm glad there is a Season 4, as the series story suggests the show must go on, despite potential negativity, it's true to its own words. Whoever put this together is very artistic and has helped created amazing characters, I hope this continues for many years to come."
6.0,31 August 2023,The series guys is really good. I found it by accident in a period where I was looking for a series to find to make me laugh a little because I was bored. The series is about two random people who live in a building and have only one thing. They like to listen to podcasts about unsolved crimes. And one day there was a murder inside the building they live in and it brought them together by chance. I won't say more to make you see it. We believe that it is not a waste of time to see it. What you will be that I never expected that Selena Gomez would play so well. I say this because I have never seen her act in films. About Steve Martin and Martin Short I don't need to say anything.
4.0,19 October 2021,"I hated this show because it was repetitive and boring. It had two huge names in the comedy business, but nothing new and drags too long. And to mention selena's annoying voice."
10.0,24 November 2021,
8.0,28 June 2022,"Can't stand the people that watched 2 or 3 episodes and then wrote a review, just watch it all. Selena fits the role, people are just biased by Disney actors hate just like they hate Zendaya and others. I'm 20 and Steve Martin and Martin Short are actors I enjoy seeing so idk what people questioning what age group is this show aimed at are talking about. It's for everyone young, old and older! Just watch, it's fun!"
8.0,23 September 2021,"I love Steve Martin & Martin Short. They work so great together. Steve Martin is an amazing writer as well, which is why I assume that many of the things that seem out or sorts were pushed by Producers/Hulu wanting to bring in a Younger audience. I also assume that's why they brought in Selena, because she reaches a younger demographic and has a huge fan club, hence all the 10 reviews. It has potential to be a great story if they stop with all the check the box woke stuff. I also feel all the profanity takes away from good dialogue. When did profanity become the norm to prove your an adult show? I hope the show improves but I feel the association with Hulu will hinder rather than help this production. They want to be edgy just to push edgy, they don't really care about story content."
10.0,11 September 2024,"We loved the first three seasons of ""Only Murders In The Building"" They were fun and engaging episodes. Steve, Martin and Selina had such great chemistry together so we were looking forward to season four. What happened to Season 4???? Episodes 1, 2 were so very boring that we had decided not to continue watching. We relented and started episode 3, but half way through we looked at each other and said, ""STILL BORING!"" We turned it off... Their acting was forced and lines were no longer compelling. What happened to the writers? What's with the diversion to a totally different location. The introduction of new characters and changing the direction was just to forced and unbelievable? We just can't watch it any longer... the storyline went over the cliff for us... which is too bad because we were fans until season four. Ugh!"
10.0,19 March 2023,"All thanks to the recent drama and Selena Gomez showing Meryl Streep and Paul Rudd that I decided to check into this show.

As a true crime listener too, this show has everything that I love. A great puzzle and question, great cast and characters, spot on humour and just an all out charm.

It is not too dark but it has the mystery set out perfectly. The puzzle is not too hard but not too easy either.

Season 1 pilot was really well done. It hook you in, introduce the characters, and set the mystery perfectly.

Season 2 has some sloppy bits. The mystery is still great but some set setting is a bit off.

Shout out to Theo. S1 ep 7 was a standout. I really like how they switch up the narrative a bit and see from other character's perspective. Even the dead one. It makes the series a lot more interesting and less monotone. 10 episodes are perfect length too. Not too long or too short.

I also really like Selena's voice in here. That deep cool voice just gets me. Steve Martin is a standout too, and I dont think I see much stuffs with Martin Short but Bunny is adorable. His relationship with his son is such a breath of fresh air. The son is a vet too!

Also their A lister connection really shown here. Keep on bringing the other actors please. Im looking forward to s3."
8.0,1 March 2022,"In times when TV shows are written on the wheels of political correctness, this show delivers some much needed oxygen to our almost collapsed lungs. Not only was this a TV show I truly enjoyed watching, it is filled with gems of jokes that make you lough out loud like there's no tomorrow. I suspect my neighbors think I'm on ""something"" and I don't care. I applaud all the creators for this great, very human piece of work."
6.0,1 November 2023,"This series is fantastic, with excellent writing and a cast of characters who fit perfectly into the story line. Being a New Yorker there are tons of people all around me who are living versions of these characters! Their reactions, attitude and delivery is classic NYC.

The single exception to these assets is the inclusion of Martin Short! The man have always been WAY over the top in every role he has ever attempted and this role is no exception. The character is obnoxious and severely irritating, which is exactly what he is supposed to be, but that is precisely the normal persona of Martin Short. Every line he delivers is like fingernails on a chalkboard and makes we want to scream ""For the love of God PLEASE shut up!"""
8.0,3 September 2022,"It's a show about three weirdos getting hyped on a murder which happened in a building they live in.

Steve Martin and Martin Short do a great job playing those two nuts. They are vivid and memorable. It's a great duo. Selena Gomez plays their young, serious and snarky counterpart to balance it out.

The pacing is great, narration well thought-out. Every episode absorbs characters in a tiny sub-story revealing bit by bit the whole puzzle so even when things go sideways, it pins it on personality quirks.

Supporting characters are great too, played well, sell the whole story nicely.

It's a whodunnit story made properly."
6.0,27 August 2022,"I am a huge fan of Steve Martin. When I was a little girl in the 80's I wanted to marry him thanks to the movie The Jerk üòÇ

This show is amazing, and refreshing. I love all the characters. I love their dynamic together. Martin Short is hilarious. He always adds such zest to whatever he is in. Selena Gomez is actually really good. If you get what kind/type of person she is portraying she will be both funny, and understandable to you. This show is a rare type in that I can watch multiple episodes in a row, and not even want to stop (binge watching, as the kids call it). Usually I don't like watching tv at all but this show sucks me in, and I can't stop watching. Wanting to know what the next episode has to offer.

The second season was as exciting as the first. It was great to see Shirley MacLaine. Though I do hope that we won't be seeing any more of Amy Schumer. There is something about her that just gets right on my last nerve. I cannot wait to see what next season, and any following seasons, will offer."
1.0,15 August 2023,"I find Only Murders in the Building to be a fun watch. A little over the top at times but that is to be expected if you have both Steve Martin and Martin Short in the same show. It was that casting got me interested although the truth is I did not expect much so i was very pleasantly surprised.

Now lets talk about Selena. There has been a lot of criticism of her limited acting skills and her lack of screen presence. She is certainly a very famous artist for younger viewers who probably do not know the two Martins. So she would widen the viewer net.

However, casting Selena works on another level for me. Almost all the other characters in the show are almost cartoon like while Silena¬¥s character is quite the opposite. Wooden? Maybe, but the casting works for me. I like to see her in a scene, she seems to average out the energy levels of the two male leads."
10.0,18 September 2021,"I watched cuz i like steve martin and mart short. It is an amusing story with some very funny moments (i loved the passive aggresdive exchange btwn the the m. Short character and the president of the apartment abot his late fees). BUT i personally do not like the very slow pacing. Basically, they are takingvthe time to give bak story for character development. This will not appeal to somebody that wants to get into the mystery clues right away. I wstched 3 episodes and probably will NOT continue. I admit tho, once we kno the characters there might be a very big enhanced payoff. But not gonna invest that much time. However, it might appeal to ppl that like the leisurely detective pace and want to really digest the dialogue."
9.0,4 November 2023,"What a fantastic performance by the lead actors. Each role had its own arc and different from each other, thats what it makes so interesting. Comic timing of lead actors are impeccable. It's very fun to watch and hilarious.

All 3 seasons had great story lines and performance was very consistent. Expected the unexpected any time.

Screenplay was excellent.

I am eagerly waiting for season 4 to release. Hope they release early.

Hope they make season 4 even more interesting in solving the murder.

Music is very suitable to all the situations and does not feel strange at all.

Finally, a great watch."
10.0,29 January 2024,"I liked the two first seasons. The first one is still the best one! But the third season is really exhausting to watch. Oliver is the most annoying character I have come across in a really long time. He is really ruining the show for me, and after 3 episodes into the third season, I had to drop watching the show. The narcissism, self-entitlement and lack of respect for other people are just too much.

However, I think Selena Gomez does an amazing job and has the most interesting character. But unfortunately, her performance is being ruined by loud and attention-seeking Oliver. It's really sad. The show has potential, but it should focus more on solving the crime and less in Olivers shenanigans."
10.0,10 September 2021,"These reviews are obviously fake. I love Martin Short and Steve Martin, but this show is bad. I like them in it, but Selena Gomez is seriously the worst actress I've ever seen. She is a so very boring in every scene with no expression and no intonation in her voice. Initially I thought it was supposed to be a joke but it never got any better at all. There is no chemistry between them and her.

Then the story itself is not very compelling. It's too slow."
9.0,30 August 2022,"I won't spoil this for anyone...

This series is just brilliant. Two seasons in and season two finished just as strong as season one. I've always loved Steve Martin and as usual he is brilliant but I think that Martin Shaw just about steals the show with his brilliant eccentric character. However all three of the leads ( Selena Gomez really shines and is equally as funny as the other two ) and the supporting cast are equally great.

There isn't anything like it around at the moment and I think that's a very good thing. A Breath of fresh air and it's great to see Martin and Shaw still at it. Comedy geniuses.

Can't wait for season three

A Must watch!"
10.0,23 October 2021,"Loved this! So refreshing to finally watch something that made me smile and laugh out loud. Classic Steve Martin and Martin Short witty humor. Plot was also fun and kept me interested. Steve, Martin and Selena had great chemistry. Looking forward to Season 2!"

10.0,2 September 2021,"I've seen the first three episodes and this is a show for everyone- very enjoyable so far. It's easy to watch, with a nice tone and upbeat storytelling, and of course the three main actors are excellent. They play really well off each other, and including Selena Gomez was smart! I get some Alex from Wizards vibes here which is a good thing, that was why we all fell in love with her to begin with.

Rating it an 8 as I binged all three available episodes it kept my attention and made me feel general happiness which is a bonus in today's world! I like the main mystery, and I am wondering more about the story. They could move a bit quicker with actual pieces of the mystery though, a few more twists would be fine. It's not laugh out loud funny but I had several chuckles.

Btw- the reviews here ? A bit much. The gushing, ""best-ever-show"" 10 ratings are all from one-show reviewers which is suspect of course. I'm sure Hulu had to put some money into paying three big name actors so trying to push this to a higher rating perhaps for popularity? It happens on here for most shows, but this seems to have more of those kinds of reviews than usual. FYI watch out for the ""only one show reviewed"" reviews. I wish they would let this one speak for itself, it's doing just fine!"
10.0,8 September 2022,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is trying to ride the relatively recent booming fascination with True Crime stories, specifically those told through the audio format. I did enjoy the first few episodes, the surprises and twists were well timed and kept me engaged.... And then the entire middle of the season slowed way down and I got bored.

Steve Martin carried the show, he did a great job and seemed to be having a blast in his role. Selena Gomez was enjoyable to watch as the New York Millennial, but goodness does she have a monotone voice (I'll never know how she's such a great singer with a talking voice that is as flat as Kansas). Finally, Martin Short... perhaps he was doing an excellent job - perhaps his instructions were ""be the most annoying neighbor you can think of, so annoying that you even irk the audience."" But either way, I did not enjoy him or his character in the show.

I'll stick around for a couple episodes of season 2. Or maybe I'll just listen to a True Crime podcast."

I know that I am behind as Season 4 just started but I be caught up in no time. I love this show so far it is really funny Oliver is always so random and Mabel or Charles is usually so excited to join him in what he's doing. I also like how the dead characters are part of the story and they have their own episode telling their own life stories giving background information on them along with helping to let the audience just exactly how these people ended up living in the building and how they all tie into the story and how they began to know each other. Selena Gomez, Martin Short and Steve Martin make a funny team and with a huge difference in their ages along with the randomness of Short paired with comebacks from Gomez are just hilarious. I would recommend anyone who hasn't watched it to watch it you because you won't regret it."
10.0,16 March 2023,"With everything that's been going on. I recently found out Selena is on this new tv show.

I was extremely excited.

But, I'm not gonna lie.. The character they created in this show is a bit dry. Like Wendy Adam's vibes but in the worse way.

Script for this character is dead inside..

Each episode. Everyone is great. But, Mabel just seems extremely depressed and medicated. I don't know if that's part of her character yet. I'm only on Episode 7. But, it's just so hard to watch. I literally just want to wrap her up in a cozy blanket with a bunch of snacks surrounding her. Watching great classic films.

Maybe this show could bring in a character. From the past a best friend who was forced to move away and now she's come back to help Mabel with the podcast. Each day she brings Mable's charter back to life. I would love to see that.

Would love that for Mabel.. Would love to see Mabel get therapy and have a break through in getting her life back. It would be great to see her character blossom into something beautiful. Finding meaning in life.

Team Selena <3 You shine brighter than all the stars ‚ú® Team Taylor <3."

9.0,18 September 2021,I started watching the show just because I love Selena Gomez .Is. Not the best show out there but it has funny scenes and the actors are good. If you want a little crime and comedy is a must watch.
8.0,1 September 2021,"I was expecting more from Steve Martin (didn't expect much from Martin Short or Selena Gomez, tbh).

But, it was all the same - Steve Martin/Martin Short bashing each other, with Selena Gomez trying to balance the act with her over the top dramatic face expressions and lack of comedy timing (when needed).

This was expensive production, so they could have invested in better writing, at least. But no, the story flow is hectic, with change of rhythm and pace all the time; dialogues are lacing point and timing al the time. It looks like somebody really neglected post production.

And paid ratings with 10/10 score and with same format of a title and text are over the top and tasteless. IMDB should remove those, especially if they come from spam accounts.

Three star out of pure generosity, sorry Steve."
9.0,18 September 2021,"This is a great Woody Allen-esque mystery. But cmon! I'm not at all familiar with Selena Gomez, and probably for good reason. She is way out of her league along side Martin and Short. I'm sure they could have found a better young actress for the part."
1.0,27 August 2022,"The best show in the history of modern television. Clean and yet absolutely hilarious. I can't find any fault in it except for Selena Gomez's acting. She (her dialogue delivery in particular) is annoying to put up with but the rest of the cast help you ignore her.

Season one is flawless. Season two doesn't start as promising but by the finale, you'd see the genius. They outdid themselves in the final episode. Martin Short is amazing throughout the series. There is no moment in the show with him in it that's disappointing.

In a nutshell, if you are looking for some fun family entertainment that will lift you up, this is the one to watch!"
7.0,23 February 2022,"As of lately, out of the things there is to watch, this show have some good acting. So many things out there with horrible acting makes it seem like good acting is no longer a criteria for being in movies and shows.. the acting in this is superb. Thank goodness."
10.0,9 July 2023,"Believe me when I say the series is worth watching. As soon as I watched the first episode, I knew that it's gonna be good. I have been a true crime fanatic for a long time. Yes they are usually more serious but this is weird in a good way. And can I say it's really cute watching the guys? Steve Martin and Martin Short are legends for a reason! I'm a big fan of Selena Gomez but she's completely different here. But she does add some class to the series. The episodes are not long but they really hook you up. A perfect binge!

I watched the two seasons twice so definitely worth the buck. Waiting for season 3."
6.0,9 July 2022,"Very interesting, smart, and funny. Having This cast back together from Father of the Bride is smart. Love the storyline. Selena is very good also. I am really looking forward to season two."
2.0,26 September 2021,"It is a really good take on the crime thrillers. It has drama, comedy, action and thrills. I absolutely love the Steve Martin, Martin Short duo, i hope it continues as strong in the next episodes."
8.0,3 September 2021,"Being from Oklahoma, if you're going to produce movies/tv shows mentioning other states' cities, PLEASE FACT CHECK WITH LOCALS ON HIW TO SAY THE CITIES/TOWNS MENTIONED.

8.0,17 April 2022,"If you love the 80's film noir, you'll love this. If you like 'who dunnits' you'll love this. If you like Steve Martin & Martin Short, you'll love this... fact is, it's an old fashioned murder mystery, with great characters and I even loved Selina Gomez in this too! Watch it, you won't be disappointed 9/10 (and only marked down as episodes were short and I was left wanting more)."
10.0,30 August 2022,
8.0,16 June 2024,"I'm a big fan of mysteries, mostly british because of the better production values. I'd really like to rate this better as I've seen lots of good work by the leads, but the dropping of so many f-bombs and other related expressions really distracts from the enjoyment. Did the writers actually believe people curse that much? It's more than 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' which is quite a notch up from this feature. I'm watching the second episode as I write this. Don't watch with your kids. Martin and Martin can be funny on so many levels, this seems below their standards. Quality is a rare thing. So much for 'modern' television."
10.0,12 July 2022,Well what a well written modern day whodunit. The acting is absolutely steller and the three main characters have some of the best dynamics in TV and they all bring their own quirks to the table. This is how to write a great series.
10.0,29 July 2023,"When this first came out I thought it looked dumb. But last night I gave it a shot and I stand corrected, it's such a great show! The only thing I'm not crazy about is Amy Schumer, they should have used someone else but Everything about it is amazing. Great humor, great story, great acting! I binged all of the first season in one night. This is the type of show you will rewatch over and over. Martin short, Steve Martin, and Selena Gomes did a phenomenal job in this! I love how witty they are. I cannot stop watching this show, it's addicting. It's definitely binge worthy. The script is great. If you haven't watched it yet, go and watch it asap! My congrats to whoever came up with this. It deserves a solid 10."
6.0,13 April 2022,"I hadn't heard of this series at all until I decided to subscribe to Disney+ on a whim. The blurb sounded intriguing and Steve Martin and Martin Short together? Well that sounded like fun.

And fun it definitely is. If you're looking for a light hearted slapstick whodunnit with very likeable characters then this is for you. I binge watched this and the episodes just flew by in no time at all. I wish there had been more! Looking forward to another season!"
10.0,13 August 2023,"Only Murders in the Building hasn't been extremely popular with the people I engage with. I can name exactly one person that watched it, who made me watch it.

I've came across this show a few times. I hadn't read about it or seen any trailers but the cast made it interesting enough for me to try and give this a chance. And then... I finally did.

The show has a ''what's going to happen next or who is going to get killed next'' vibe but set more in modern times, through their podcast. I must say I loved it from the first episode but I got instantly hooked after episode 2.

I have a very short attention spam and for me to binge something, it has to be really good, which I think this show was. Steve Martin is great, Martin Short is absolute brilliant and brings such a great dose of humor to the show and I got an unexpected crush on Selena Gomez who is just great in this.

Without spoiling too much, you'll have thoughts and suspects throughout the show. You suspect the show to be a funny dark comedy, but the storyline is actually written very well. Might not be for everyone, but I'm a fan.

Will probably re-watch season 1 soon as I called my mom last night after I finished the last episode of season 1. Just watched the trailer for season 2 and I' very excited. A bit afraid it's not going to be nearly as good as the first season was but I guess we're just going to have to wait and see."
7.0,25 June 2022,"I love this show and everything about it. It's lighthearted, funny and a real joy to watch. No political rubbish, no hidden agenda just good old easy watching. I can't wait for season 2!"
5.0,9 August 2023,"Only Murders in the Building is a fun show that prioritizes entertainment over whatever is going on with most current shows.

The chemistry between the lead actors is super fun to watch, the humor works for me and the mysteries, albeit sometimes a bit far-fetched, are truly interesting and compelling. I don't really know anything about Selena Gomez but she's really good in this show. I love her character's dry sarcasm and her facial expressions are gold.

I can't wait to watch season 3 right away. I truly hope the show will not be milked until the quality starts to decline and instead gets a thrilling and worthy ending. Good endings these days seem to be a relict of the past."
10.0,7 July 2022,
9.0,2 September 2021,"Lower rating for this really fun show is because of two things:

One is the darkness. Seems like it was made during a power outage.

Second, the volume. It was necessary to put the volume up all the way but when the commercials came on it was ear-breaking loud.

Other than that, a great, fun show."
9.0,13 July 2022,Love everything about this show. My husband and I literally count down the days until a new episode drops. I will say the first season was a little predictable. But oddly I didn't mind that very much with this show. Definitely recommend Thai show!
10.0,10 May 2022,"This is a fun binge worthy series...the story and acting was super until the rather contrived and downer of the last episode...that ruined it for me.

It seems Martin went overboard for a trick ending that was pointless."
10.0,2 September 2021,"I tried to like it, I really did. It is so slow and drags. The dialog and plot is very repetitive, especially Selena Gomez's frequently I'll timed dropping of the F bomb just for shock value. Can't see how they are dragging this out over 5 episodes. The plot seems to be going nowhere."
9.0,4 November 2021,"Like the opening credits imply, this show feels like a love letter to New York and what happens when they don't ""mind their business."" The characters are fun, and it strikes a good balance between mystery and humor. Steve Martin and Martin Short give standout performances and the story will keep you guessing until the end."
7.0,20 December 2021,"The only bit I didn't like about this was Martin Short's character's state of life; that plot has gotten old, in every sense of word.

That out of the way, everything else was just amazing.

The title of review meant that I could watch it thrice: once for chemistry, second time for drawings and third time for music oh so music.

Do enjoy."
10.0,10 July 2022,"This show provides an old school whodunnit mystery series. The story is lighthearted and entertaining. It narrates the story without the usual clich√© features of popular murder mysteries these days have.

Martin, Steve and Selena form a perfect trio with a good chemistry. There characters are very relatable. Though the show is advertised as a comedy, the characters are portrayed in a very realistic way with naturalistic acting.

Overall it is a very entertaining, relatable light hearted mystery series."
6.0,25 August 2023,"Finally more US shows with heft, good acting, etc. I do feel the use of profanity feels both unnecessary and actually distracts from the quality of the show. It doesn't feel right and certainly doesn't contribute to the entertainment value. I guess what I'm saying is it feels gratuitous. That said, I'm enjoying the story lines, characters and of course seeing two faves from my teen years, Martin and Steve. Icons to be sure, but they also work so well in this show. I wasn't sure about it at first, but was hooked by the the third episode. Selena does a nice job, too, although maybe a bit lackluster-though I don't have any experience with her talents to base anything on."
2.0,1 July 2023,"I loved the first season, and now I am on episode two of season two. I felt compelled to share how great the show really is. Do you know the feeling you get when it is storming outside and you are curled up on the couch with a compelling book, one where you can't stop reading? Well, this show is like the cozy blanket that covers you up, that you snuggle down under as you delve into the exciting mystery of the story. It's like the comfortable chair, the soft couch that you relax on. It wraps its soft arms around you and just envelopes you. This show is delicious. It's a joy for the senses from the beauty of the building to the soft music. And it goes without saying that the acting is just phenomenal. The three main characters mesh together so well, and they feed off of each other in such a way that you are left, feeling that they complete each other. Each character is a joy, but they are so much better together."
10.0,4 July 2022,I'm suprised of how entertaining it was for me since I'm not that much into true crime and I could say it's one of my favourite shows to watch currently. The characters are very interesting and fun to get to know. I would recommend the show especially for those who are into solving mysteries.
10.0,17 July 2022,"Both the writing and the dialog are superb! I wish all of Hollywood would spend this much time and effort on the craft!

I had to pull my wife, who hates obscenities, into the room to watch Teddy Dimas threaten Oliver at the elevator. So many movies overuse the F-word that it loses its punch. But in this case, it was so perfect!"
8.0,28 March 2022,"Would've given this show an easy 8 but Selena Gomez has so little emotion in her acting and doesn't seem to put any effort into her lines. However if you can pretend Gomez is as good as everyone else, it makes for a highly entertaining show."
10.0,8 July 2022,"This show is a comedy, mystery and light drama all in one. I LOVE it!! The cast meshes very well together and there are some moments that had me laughing so hard. Season 2 (the üßÄ) was too funny."
8.0,14 October 2021,"After 2 episodes I'm kinda hooked, all due to the manic energy of Martin Short. I know Steve Martin works well with under written part Selena Gomez is here for the kids. Where this will go is anyone's guess but the interiors are wonderful. Art work is a deco Emmey winner. I may write more about this show if it pans out. Till. Cheers everyone."
10.0,11 October 2021,"I'm only watching it because Martin Short holds my interest and has some good scenes. Steve Martin is decent in this. They could have written more witty banter between these two though to help this show.

But my goodness, Selena Gomez CANNOT act. She's just horrible. Just vapid with a monotone weird voice that never varies tone. She acts medicated. She has absolutely no spark about her whatsoever. Very dull actress. And I use the term actress loosely here. Even her timing and physical movements in some scenes are just off and very unnatural looking.

It would have been better had they cast her role to someone better. She's definitely the weak link in this one and unfortunately she's a big part of this show.

They also swear a lot in this show in certain parts and it seems out of place and forced. Like oh let's drop in a bunch of f bombs to look hip and cool. It was completely unnecessary and got tiring."
7.0,23 April 2022,"In a time of rebuilding after the pandemic, we're all under a lot of stress. There's alot if garbage on streaming that promises you an escape but just disrespects your time and intelligence - only exacerbating the PTSD we're all struggling with.

This show is that much desired escape. It's smart and funny with acting that effortlessly pops off the screen. The chemistry between Steve, Marty and Selena is perfect. It's truly an ensemble piece. The endless line of cameos and amazing side characters leaves you hungry for the next minutes. The mystery is actually intriguing and unfolds at just the right pace.

Do yourself a favor and watch this!!!!"
10.0,13 June 2023,"My first attempt to watch it was over a a year ago. I watched the translated version though and I hated it. I couldn't even finish the first episode.

Now I noticed it on the Disney+ and decided to give it another chance, this time with no translation.

OMG! It made such a difference! The irony, the jokes, the characters. I loved all of that. And being a fan of the detectives and the comedies, it just made a perfect mixture for me of both. I watched it with a smile on my face. I loved the characters and their chemistry. I loved the twists and turns of the plot. Absolutely loved it!

Now I will be eagerly wait to the season 3 :)"
7.0,31 July 2023,"Only Murders in the Building, is a show I would watch over and over again. Every single time I watch it, I notice something new, or catch an easter egg. The show itself is amazing, with an all-star cast and funny jokes sprinkled throughout each episode. I think Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez bring a lot to their roles. Even the supporting cast members have such personality, I couldn't keep my eyes off of them. It has amazing, yet chilling, music that really relaxes you if you have been having a bad day. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of mystery and thriller. It will definitely not disappoint."
1.0,4 September 2021,
10.0,25 October 2023,"The cast is amazing. The dynamic of the characters are so unique and beautiful. Some of the comments mentioned how Selena was not quite right for the part and how annoying her character sometime was etc. Well, I think that's the whole point that make the friendship of the three so unique and funny. I personally think Selena has been great at portraying Mabel. She is fun, moody, quirky, a bit annoying, a bit ignorance and yet very charming. And most importantly, the character is very so relatable to the current demographic. Saying that though, I do want to see the character evolved more.

Season 3 seems to be different from the first two and I can see it's not everyone's taste. But again, the whole cast was amazing."
9.0,3 September 2024,"I absolutely adore Only Murders in the Building! Each character brings something uniquely delightful to the table. Steve Martin as Charles showcases brilliant comedic timing with his deadpan delivery and hilarious expressions, especially that confused look he gets when he realizes he's in a murder mystery. His attempts to be cool often lead to adorably awkward moments that are just pure gold. Martin Short as Oliver brings a whirlwind of energy, with his snorts and exaggerated expressions making every scene entertaining. He balances being hilariously self-absorbed with genuine care for his friends. Selena Gomez as Mabel adds a refreshing touch with her dry humor and relatable cynicism, keeping the guys grounded while delivering spot-on comebacks. Together, they create a charming dynamic that not only keeps you laughing but also makes the show feel uplifting and engaging, unlike typical crime stories. The mix of humor and real themes makes Only Murders in the Building a delightful watch!

What sets this show apart from typical crime stories is its lighthearted approach. It manages to keep viewers entertained and uplifted, even as it delves into serious themes like friendship and loneliness. The chemistry between the three leads is fantastic, creating moments that are both hilarious and heartfelt. Their quirky personalities and comedic timing elevate the mood, making the show feel less like a standard crime drama and more like a fun adventure.

Each season introduces new mysteries and twists, ensuring that it never feels boring. The clever writing and engaging plotlines keep you guessing while also making you laugh, proving that crime can be both thrilling and enjoyable."
10.0,1 September 2021,So damn funny and addictive. Love the trio's dynamic.
8.0,19 January 2022,"I Love Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez! Period!

Beginning right from naming of this series, it is a sheer work of Geniuses. As the name suggests, it is based on murder mystery and with the 3 top names to the tag, one can expect nothing but a masterpiece.

The story is pretty slow in the beginning and picks up in around 7th episode but let me assure you that it keeps you glued throughout because of the cracking jokes and amazing acting done by Martin Short, Steve Martin, Selena Gomez, Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan and the rest.

I personally feel that there should be more cracking jokes added to the story, which will make it definitely more appealing plus a more challenging plot would be welcoming as I had already guessed the murderer and just like me, other people would too.

The writing is wonderful and I give credit to the directors who have done an amazing job with the twisting plot and keeping the things moving.

It is a refreshing series and I highly recommend to watch it with a mug of hot coffee, snuggled together with a loved one on a comfortable couch at night.

I am giving it 7 stars as there is still a potentiality to improve, to make this show skyrocket up, up and away.

Bravo!"
10.0,22 August 2022,"The storyline is good, but I enjoyed the character interactions as much as the plot, which has a few twists and turns.

Great chemistry between the cast.

Steve Martin and Martin Short play their parts perfectly, with Gomez masterfully pulling off the difficult ""snarky, mean loner who is actually very likeable"" role.

I wanted to know about the characters from the very start.

Perfect pacing makes this an extra joy to watch.

Can't wait to jump into season 2."
10.0,13 September 2024,"I loved the central place of the heritage apartment building called The Arconia in the first two seasons...it is like a character in itself. That seems to drop off somewhat in Season 3 when another venue begins to ""steal the show.""

I was pleasantly surprised by Meryl Streep's singing ability demonstrated in Season 3. Everyone knows her acting talent but I hadn't known of that extra talent in her back pocket.

I have to agree with reviewers who have commented on Selena Gomez' performance, her nasal and expressionless voice especially, bringing down the show's quality. I just finished Season 3 and have found her increasingly irritating as time goes on. Unfortunately with the three amigos scenario built into the series, there just wouldn't be a way to replace her.

I have assumed Gomez is in the cast to add a little youth appeal because Steve Martin and Martin Short are older actors. But, wow, this performer is a distraction because she isn't up to the level of the rest of the cast. I have continued watching despite her seeming like a fish out of water (or the elephant in the room?)

I will watch the Season 4 episodes that are out already and decide if I want to spend another month's streaming subscription fee to watch it to that season's end."
6.0,26 September 2023,"My expectations were high, after all the positive reactions, almost a hype that arose around the series. But unfortunately, this series absolutely could not ignite with me and it does not even come close to the hype. I tried to like it and almost struggled through the episodes. It was supposed to be fun, funny and engaging but unfortunately everything seems so forced.

To make it extraordinary creative ways are taken, the suspects are put on a stage, or there is an episode that takes place completely without speech, only background noise and sign language, with subtitles. But all this doesn't help make it more entertaining. Because the overall pace is so slow that it was just insanely boring.

The three characters, Charles, Oliver and Mabel, already seem to harmonize with each other, but honestly it seems like a last desperate gasp for relevance for Martin Short and Steve Martin. Sadly, it ends up being ridiculous and cheap. Selena's one dimensional acting, adds nothing to the series. She has a single facial expression and I could not detect any acting talent in her in this series. She delivers her lines so monotonously that she lacks any comedic timing.

The plot is nonsensical and swings awkwardly between boring drama and flat comedy, the action is slow and the dialogues are stilted. An arc of suspense isn't built up, as everything is talked over and over again, the focus is too much on the three characters with their backgrounds and the podcast project. The resolution at the end seems very far-fetched and not comprehensible.

The series commits one of the biggest writing mistakes possible, it explains too much, it even explains the comedy instead of being funny. It all comes together, jokes that could still make it into the 80's, poor casting, tired, terrible script that tries to fit a joke everywhere, even with the cliffhangers at the end of each episode it's still boring and dialogue that could be from a school play. In addition, music that goes in the direction of musical, with which I can not do so much.

The story progresses unbearably slowly, becoming uninteresting over time.

The last episode of the first season ends with a cliffhanger that you have to watch the second season if you want to know the resolution. I have only watched half of the second season so far and will not continue unless I have to. In addition, fans of the first season are disappointed by the second and third and the reviews are getting worse. Thus, it will probably not get better for me.

-------------- Conclusion: Annoying - Not funny, not exciting, it's not even particularly interesting, but was a disappointment."
8.0,2 August 2022,"This show is the best thing, that had happened to TV world, in the last couple of years. Extremely entertaining. Classical Steve Martin always deliver. Phenomenal Martin Short, every line he says is witty and hilarious. And surprisingly good acting by Selena Gomez."
7.0,9 August 2022,"Great for a family watch, a good weekend watch, lovely cast, amazing story, you get mystery, comedy, drama, crime, each episode more addicted than the other."
5.0,20 August 2022,His character Oliver Putnam is my absolute favorite. He adds the humor and the comments that keep the show moving and afloat. Without him I'm not sure I'd like it as much.
8.0,25 July 2022,"This is a 10 out of 10. Without question! I haven't enjoyed a show on any platform this much in I don't know how long. Funny, fast moving, exciting and well played. I love the cast- everyone is just great in this. I'm not going to give a pithy cinematic critique because I don't feel like it and it would come off as phoney baloney at any rate. Want entertainment? Want to laugh and be engaged in a show? Watch and enjoy! I am grinning ear to ear and grateful that the writers and cast of OMITB have their skills together to create entertainment and not eye roll inducing nonsense. YAY. Thank you."
8.0,5 August 2022,I'm not a fan of the main actors and the type of comedies they're usually in. Not all jokes land imho. But I think the show has something special what keeps you watching. I just binged the first season and I want more.
8.0,14 September 2022,"I Love this show. So funny in a mature, sophisticated way. It's great to see Martin Short and Steve Martin together and Selina Gomez really holds her own. She's much better than I expected. The other characters in the building are so diverse but feel real and kooky. There are so many great actors in the show and they keep bringing in more! I was not expecting it to be so enjoyable and after the first season I didn't expect the second to be as good but it is. The writing is quite clever. The show even has excellent sound tracks. They find the perfect songs for each episode. Even my 18 yo son likes the show. It's nice we can still share a show together."
8.0,4 July 2022,"This is no doubt a great cast of characters however, Selena Gomez has zero layers of emotion or depth. If she is playing the ""straight"" women she is too straight, annoyingly so, which is disappointing because she is so cute and i find myself waiting, yearning for some display of likability.

Amy Schumer? Ugh. Worst casting ever. This women EXHUDES pertension in everything she does.

The second season is quickly disappointing but ill keep watching because Steve Martin and Martin Short are everything!"
8.0,15 August 2023,"You've got to watch so many dramas and movies to appreciate how intelligent and brilliant this one is made. Just love the story, great characters, well written and directed, and the pictures. A bit familiar taste like Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest.

Absolutely stunning. All episodes are beautifully crafted. No spoiler, episode 7 is absolutely epic.

This is a must see. So hilarious and never a dull moment.

I really don't like this minimum words thing. Why have I keep typing when I finish what I want to say and would like to share my thoughts already? Why put a minimum length on readers to have to go through?"
8.0,22 September 2021,"It's a refreshing good show and quite suitable to all audiences have it not been for f bomb fillers. Does it really fall that Short without the attention grasping fillers.

We enjoy it but would not recommend and cringe at the constant F can't find a thought language.

Hollywood can't keep it clean. Fughüò´"
6.0,8 January 2022,"Not sure what the other reviews were watching, or indeed their level of comedy and fun. But this waney it for me.

I was so bored by this. It is flat, flat flat. Nice scenery of New York and that's about it for me."
10.0,19 August 2022,"This team couldn't be better together. The holes in the plot can easily be overlooked by the chemistry of the three lead actors.

I am overly concerned about the end.

I was a little distracted by the herpes on the face of one actor playing a minor role."
7.0,27 July 2022,"This show is so well written, and every week has yet another turn.

I've always found Martin Short to be annoying, but he is absolutely prefect in this role. I do believe, like so many others have stated, that the role of Mabel is better suited for another actress. Selena brings no life to the part at all. And then there's Steve Martin...and who doesn't love him?

9/10 from me...taking one star off for the monotone and lifeless portrayal of Mabel."

9.0,27 November 2023,"The series is about a murder in an expensive piece of residential real estate in New York called The Arconia...or at least our three strangers turned podcasters think it's a murder, the police think it is a straightforward suicide. The three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez, all live in the building and are brought together during a fire alarm because of their love of a true crime podcast (the podcast is done by a character played by Tina Fey), everything is not ok in Oklahoma. When the three of them discover there has been a death in the building, they decide to come together to solve it...and naturally do a podcast about it.

Amazing cameos and wonderful melancholy storylines...everyone seems to be hiding something, which is a great set up for a who-done-it. I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

*EDIT SEASON 2* Season 2 starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that don't land and Amy Schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party.

But by episode 3 it is all back on track Well done!

8.0,29 July 2023,"Loads of suspense twists & turns. Absolutely grade a casting. Superb guest characters. Excellent dialogue. Minimum Hollywood nonsense. All script.

I feel like I'm reading a huge old investigation novel as the screenplay is so perfect and poised. The twists and plot turns are rampant and savage.

Fabulous direction. The set is stunning. A huge vintage apartment block going back years. Probation era then some. Amazing props and art direction.

The clothes are fabulous. The main cast look like college drop-outs who have quit art school.

I just adore this show. It's hugely original yet hugely reminiscent of Hitchcock, French new wave and Fritz Lang. I absolutely adore it. Plus a Dyspraxic super model turned actress involved makes me happy.

Sublime. 10/10."
9.0,14 September 2021,"Great to see Steve Martin, lots of great characters, Gomez held on, must have learned quite a bit. The only strange thing is for some reason it kept reminding me of ""The Airline Attendant "". Young woman, murder, cartoon open....but its fun."
10.0,1 February 2023,"I have the utmost respect for Martin Short and Steve Martin. Class act, witty humour, they are the old wine and caviar in this show.

And next to them, a bag of chips. Because... that's what young people eat? They brought Selena because they wanted to expand the target audience?

She was pretty (good) in Disney, has some nice songs, but here... or maybe, who knows, she is supposed to act that bad? Her character is so... bland and she had to act it the same? Then, damn, she nailed it!

Anyhow, the weight of the show is carried by the 2 precious stones of the classic comedy: Steve Martin Short üòâ And because of them, I'm rating this show 8 stars."
8.0,3 October 2021,"Martin and Short are fantastic, but Selinas voice ruins it. I don't know if this is how she always sounds but it just grates on my nerves when she talks :( The storyline is good, I just wish they'd found any other actress!"
7.0,19 October 2021,"Well, I just started season 3 and boy am I bored. What was delightful has worn thin and the girl-on-girl action in episode 1 was just too much. Hello, programming directors, we really do not need a lesbian-type or homosexual scene in every single series. Frankly, while I'm completely supportive of LGBTQ equal rights, the prevalence in our society is simply not nearly as much as that portrayed in many recent series. So I give up. This series has officially become boring, and it's too bad. It started off with such promise! What an interesting, charming, quirky, unexpected delight this series is! Spot on performances from all actors and chock full of funny little twisty personality types. Watch it! Immediately!"
8.0,10 September 2024,"""Only Murders in the Building"" is a masterful blend of mystery, comedy, and drama that has quickly become one of the standout series of recent years. Created by Steve Martin and John Hoffman, this show is an impressive demonstration of how a well-crafted premise can evolve into a deeply engaging and entertaining narrative.

The series is set in the luxurious but enigmatic Arconia apartment building, where three seemingly disparate residents-Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin), Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), and Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez)-find their lives intertwined by a shared fascination with true crime. When a murder occurs in their building, these three neighbors, who bond over their mutual love for true crime podcasts, decide to investigate the crime themselves. This decision propels the show into a labyrinth of twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

Characters and Performances

The heart of ""Only Murders in the Building"" lies in its remarkable cast. Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez deliver standout performances, each bringing a unique flair to their roles.

Steve Martin's Charles-Haden Savage, a former TV actor, is both endearing and hilariously out of touch with the modern world. Martin's portrayal of Charles is a perfect balance of charm and comic timing, highlighting his character's vulnerability and complexity. Martin Short's Oliver Putnam, an exuberant and often theatrical Broadway director, provides a comic counterpoint with his over-the-top personality and emotional depth. Short's comedic genius shines through, creating moments of genuine laughter and emotional resonance.

Selena Gomez's Mabel Mora, the youngest of the trio, brings a fresh and nuanced energy to the series. Gomez skillfully navigates Mabel's emotional layers, from her sharp wit to her poignant past. The dynamic between these three characters is nothing short of electrifying, as their different perspectives and personalities create a delightful blend of humor and drama.

Writing and Direction

The writing in ""Only Murders in the Building"" is exceptional. The show's creators have crafted a narrative that is both intricately plotted and richly layered. The dialogue is sharp and witty, often delivering clever commentary on the world of true crime and podcast culture. The mystery itself is engaging, filled with twists and red herrings that keep the audience guessing until the very end.

John Hoffman and Steve Martin's direction ensures that the series maintains a perfect balance between suspense and comedy. The pacing is spot-on, with each episode contributing to the overall mystery while also delving into character development and subplots. The show's use of cliffhangers and unexpected revelations ensures that viewers are always eager for the next installment.

Production Design and Atmosphere

The Arconia building, with its old-world charm and eerie ambiance, becomes a character in its own right. The production design is meticulous, capturing the building's grandeur and quirks in a way that enhances the show's atmosphere. The stylish cinematography and well-chosen soundtrack further contribute to the series' unique tone, blending the classic elegance of the building with modern sensibilities.

Themes and Social Commentary

""Only Murders in the Building"" is more than just a mystery; it also explores themes of loneliness, connection, and the search for purpose. Through its characters, the show delves into the impact of modern technology on human relationships and the ways in which people cope with isolation. The series provides a thoughtful and sometimes poignant look at how we seek meaning and companionship in an increasingly disconnected world.

Conclusion

In conclusion, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a triumph of contemporary television. Its clever writing, exceptional performances, and engaging mystery make it a standout series. The show effortlessly combines humor and suspense while exploring deeper themes, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking. Whether you're a fan of true crime, a comedy aficionado, or simply someone looking for a compelling and well-crafted series, ""Only Murders in the Building"" is a must-watch that promises both intrigue and delight.

Coming in at a solid 8/10."
7.0,4 August 2023,"I haven't quite made it through the first season yet. What caught my, like most I'm sure, attention was the age old Martin/Short team coming back together. It was great to see some comedic heavy hitters in something a little different. It feels like mystery of the show is just as much who the murder is as it is what famous person will show up next.

Although I realize we live in an age where so many ideas have already been done, I couldn't ignore what felt like an obvious nod to the first season of Sarah Koenig's Serial podcast. The music, Tina's Fey's character, the idea of regular(ish) citizens making a podcast attempting to get to the bottom of a murder mystery . . . It's pretty clear. And it felt a tad played out if you've heard the podcast.

Given that we seem to live in an age where good ideas have mostly been done and feesh takes can be difficult to find, each episode being presented from a different character's perspective, I thought, I was clever.

The show was very well done, but I couldn't quite seem to get completely sucked in from the start like I imagined I might, but I'll keep watching out of curiosity."
1.0,21 November 2021,
8.0,8 December 2021,"I loved the humour and the warmth you feel watching the characters interact. Our ""detectives"" are an odd ensemble of very different personalities, all of them keeping their painful past experiences secret from one another, but as they are bound together by the mystery they are trying to solve, they end up helping each other heal. I feel this series really could have been a 10/10 if only... well, if only the actual crime mystery was a bit more compelling.

The rare combination of warmth and comedy with crime brings to mind the film Knives Out. And it's not a favourable comparison to Only Murders in the Building, in my opinion. Whereas Knives Out was an Agatha Christie-style whodunnit where everyone was a suspect for the greater part of it, Only Murders in the Building dumbs the mystery down by tackling only one piece of the puzzle at a time and mostly resolving it before introducing another lead, resulting in a structure that's rather linear and not particularly stimulating to the viewer's brain cells. Regardless, I am looking forward to the second season; if it improves on this one aspect, the show may become something really great!"
8.0,3 October 2021,
10.0,17 November 2021,"Martin Short and Steve Martin are comedic revelations in this! I could care less about Selena Gomez. I think she wasn't bad for the role but anyone could have replaced her and it would have been fine. But the two geezers, they show every wannabe supposed ""comedian"" out there how it's really done. So. Damn. Funny! They are brilliant and I'm so glad they did this show."
10.0,21 September 2021,"I swear like a sailor. I often have to check myself. But the profanity in this show feels like the writers were trying to squeeze them in at every moment like 12 year-olds who just learned how to swear and don't think there are any adults in hearing distance. It's forced and unnecessary, and just plain awkward at moments. Quite distracting, unfortunately.

The storyline and acting itself? Eh...I'm just in it for Steve Martin and Martin Short. I just love 'em."
8.0,25 November 2022,"This just came up as an auto play on after something else I was watching, so I thought I'd give it a go. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this cause it's one of my favourite shows I've ever watched. I loved it as soon as I watched the first episode. Everything about it is just so great. The perfect soundtrack, the excellent acting, the extremely likeable and comical characters, and the cosy feel of old architecture and Poirot-esque mystery solving seamlessly blended with a modern setting and story-line.

I love it. This is definitely going to be something I watch multiple times, due in large part simply to the cosy and familiar feel it has to it and it's extremely loveable characters."
10.0,22 September 2021,"As many have already pointed out, the story is OK. There are F-bombs left and right, 99% are TOTALLY unnecessary. Too bad. It would have been good, clean family fun."
6.0,14 September 2021,Not interesting at all. Watch it only if you like the people in it.
8.0,17 July 2022,"I love this serie,it's a light comedy and also a detective and it's really lovely to see how they act clumpsy! They solve the murder at the end but than Mabel is being arrested because ""Bunny"" is murdered (and they suspect the trio ofcourse!!) I'm curious to know how it will end (this 2nd season). I love it! Have fun (binge) watching this show...I did!"
7.0,27 June 2022,"This is one of the best tv shows I have seen recently. Such a great cast, totally in with Selena. It's never boring, episodes are short and very intriguing."
2.0,23 October 2021,"I really enjoyed this. Steve, Martin, and Selena made a great ragtag trio. Lose the forced swearing and I would have given it a 9. Seriously, it didn't add anything to an otherwise great comedy."
8.0,15 July 2022,"This review is written after watching 14 episodes of the show(10 from season 1 and 4 from season 2).

I can't pick out more than one or two flaws from this show, everything is very well done. Especially loved the Chemistry of the main trio, the intro score(If you have listened to Serial you'll know), the Production design and the Cinematography. The Plot is more than just good enough and it keeps you guessing. I'm definitely looking forward to the coming episodes."
10.0,4 March 2023,"Very enjoyable indeed! In the same vein as the Aniston/ Sandler 'Murder Mystery' with the nods to the genre and the current craze for true crime, this is a fun drama. The three leads are excellently carved out by what seem like an unlikely trio but which works. Even better for the pathos generated for the lead characters- you like them, pity them, envy them at times, all of which make this a very watchable programme. The many cameos enhance, rather than detract; it does seem like a who's who of tv and film, which makes it feel like a weighty piece of tv, not as frothy as it might seem, which everyone wanted to be a part of. Enjoy!"
10.0,9 July 2022,"I love this show!! Steve Martin and Martin Short are such a great pair and to add a Rockstar like Selena Gomez is absolutely brilliant. Season one will have you guessing and season two is just as good. Extremely well written, the actors hit their mark everytime, and the feel of the set is very cozy.

The only thing about this show I don't like is Amy Shumer. She is disgusting, horrible at acting, truly isn't funny and does not mesh well with anyone one this show. She unfortunately ruins every thing she is in."
9.0,30 October 2021,"It's very obvious that Selena Gomez is the star of this show. I am not a fan of her, but I just love her there. Her voice and everything about her just seem well fitted there. Despite the popular stars, this overall show is not ""a star"" yet. Well, the plot is actually pretty interesting, and I keep waiting more suprises so it would be more attractive. But after completing all episodes, I must admit this is only an average show, it's not bad but it's also not something that you must add into your watch list."
10.0,17 June 2022,"That if you want to take your series to the next level, go with seasoned pros who can deliver their lines better than Amazon delivers parcels. Awesome."
8.0,25 February 2024,"Like Martin Short in Only Murders in the Building, I too have an uncomfortable relationship with dips haha.

Love these two together on and off screen and Selena plays well off of them As a voice of reason and to remind them of their age.

The mysteries themselves are great but it's the characters and one liners that keep me coming back to This show.

I cannot WAIT for season 4 and 5 and 6. Hopefully steve Martin doesn't decide to retire earlier than that. Steve, do not do that to us please!

Have enjoyed all their press they've been doing together and I get a sense that they are both like this with each other in real life.

Make more of these as soon as possible."
7.0,30 October 2021,They should have not dropped the f word so needlessly or made an entire episode just about lesbians. If they hadn't this would have been a really fun family show but as it is I would not watch this with children.
8.0,1 September 2021,"Wholly detestable snobs as main characters. Out of touch with the real world. If this is what you think it is to be a New Yorker then you have never been to the city. All three characters are Mary Sues, there only problems are in their own imaginations. Fairy tale tripe. I'm saddened by the rave reviews."
7.0,28 September 2021,"I love it. I long for it every week. Once a week?! Cruelty in its most brutal form.

I have no idea why i love it so much. But it's like delicious macaroni cheese - not the best meal every created, but one that's full of flavour and makes you feel comfy, cosy and full.

Thanks team."

9.0,23 March 2023,"This show is excellent and I knew it would become a big old comforting friend from thje moment I saw the trailer. It's so hard to find gentle comedies these days that the whole family can curl up and enjoy but Murders hits the mark straight on and has become such a firm favouritre in our house with us and our kids. I like plenty of dark drama (just come off Euphoria and started Swarm) but stuff that the whole family can watch is thin on the ground. The only comparable show I can think of that does the same as Murders is Ted Lassoo and given hom much we crave a bit of time out from the world of stress and worry I do wonder why the tv companies/streamers don't give us more of this sort of content.

The cast are amazing and ther writing is crisp and clean and often hiolarious. It's the perfect binge watch for anyone who needs a bit of time away For anyone who loves a good detective-crime-mystery story but can't handle too much darkness, this is the perfect binge-watch!"
8.0,28 November 2023,"When I signed up with Disney+ (to watch Doctor Who), I was very keen to watch ""Always Sunny"" and ""Only Murders"".

I gave up watching the former, but binged three seasons of the latter.

It's difficult to explain what's so good about it, because on paper it probably shouldn't work. But I think it's got something for everyone - a little drama with a load of good-natured humour.

There is obvious (long-standing) chemistry between Steve Martin and Martin Short, but Selena Gomez fits very nicely in their clique. I like how some actors play characters (e.g. Meryl Streep) while others play themselves (e.g. Matthew Broderick) and they all do a wonderful job of it.

I was also very impressed with performances by Nathan Lane and James Caverly."
8.0,14 August 2022,"Season one was a 9 bro, it was well-balanced with suspense, well-thought-out plot, character development, and great comedy. But season 2, idk, the guest actors were mostly a different vibe, and it seems they're spending too much attention on just goofing around and not advancing the plot anymore."
8.0,9 August 2022,"I wished they could tone down the profanity just a bit! I mean, they are not necessary. It is such a great show, even if the profanity was toned gown or removed completely. Anyway, that's just an opinion. Great tv series with a great cast. I'm enjoying it!"
10.0,12 October 2021,"I don't understand the rave in the media, was promising first few episodes, I had hope, as first episodes usually start off rocky sometimes, but it went into a flat dull not clear mess, I'm shocked that it was allowed further, how come we're hearing about season 2, waste of money and screen time in my opinion."
10.0,21 October 2021,Love the characters and roller coaster story line. Very disappointed with the continual crude language. It's hard to believe that anyone can't talk intelligently without using fu#%*ing this every other sentence.
7.0,19 February 2022,"Great show. But what the ... is Greek holocaust? Hollywood please don't invent holocausts to get investment from minorities! üò° It's a fun show, great acting, nice story. But why do you have to implement a made up subliminal message into it? What's the historical document or legal backings of such hoax as Greek holocaust? Hollywood is very enthusiastic about lies blaming any country that not christian."
9.0,23 January 2022,"The show has a nice but selena ruined it , at the beginning I thought that her character was supposed to be the way she acted but eventually it was just bad acting !"
7.0,8 September 2021,"The first episode was a decent draw to the show with the Martins, a colorful New York palette, and a titillating mystery. However, as the episodes have gone on, you realize there is really nothing of substance there. The murder mystery isn't sold well enough, the characters aren't that interesting, it flip-flops awkwardly between boring drama and flat comedy, the plot is slow, and the dialogue is stilted.

To add insult to injury, Selena Gomez is TERRIBLE. I'm not sure how much the critics are getting paid to praise her performance, but she is completely wooden, monotone, and emotionless. She can't even muster up as much energy as her 70-year-old counterparts. I'm not sure who made the decision to cast her but she is definitely wrong for the part and wrong for the acting world.

This show's only saving grace is that it has brightness and color unlike most shows within the last decade... and the Martins do manage to make me smile at points."
3.0,14 September 2021,"If anyone ever doubted the acting power of martin short, this will blow you away. He is full of character and all emotions made me truly feel what he was feeling.

Steve martin has always been a favorite of mine and he's brilliant in this too.

Selena, who I've followed since waverly place, is good too.

As a hearty listener to true crime podcasts, I can appreciate the timing of this show and I'm invested in the murder."
10.0,27 December 2023,
10.0,8 September 2024,"Wow this is awsome. But i had to give it a second try. I gave up after 2 episodes the first time.this show has evrything. Its funny, twist and turns, drama, and murder mysteries. And so many great caracthers and guest roles.i am also a huge Steve Martin fan thow.so i gave this a 10/10 because i could not stop watching it not that often a tv show do that to the viewers anymore.i hope for many more seasons. Only negative was it starts a little slow beside that perfect.also a perfect cast dident know who Selena Gomez was but she is very good to.pepole behind the camera to did a great Job with this one."
9.0,1 July 2022,"I have no idea how police in this universe is able to convict anyone when this trio is constantly touching and sharing evidence.

Other than that, I've enjoyed season one a lot (binged it) and was excited for season two but it's not as exciting. I don't know if they should have kept this show as a mini series or if it's because I'm not a fan of Amy Schumer. Also, Selena's relationship with Cara's character is awkward to me, there's no passion between them."
8.0,12 March 2022,This was super entertaining and the trio was perfect. Steve Martin as always hilarious and perfect timing. The whole plot was interesting and hooked you from the first episode. The whole aesthetic and the background music was the highlight of this show. It's a light murder mystery without showing much violence or gore scenes but still with all the twists and thrills. Even the light hearted can definitely give it a try. Those who don't like murder mystery thrillers might find this an exception. Cant wait for season 2.
9.0,2 August 2022,"I just started to watch it, and it's a very charming series. I love the humour and style. Story is great, and it really just feels like home to watch Steve Martin and Martin Short doing comedy together."
9.0,22 April 2022,"YOU WILL REMEMBER THE COMEDY POSSIBLY FOR LIFE BUT WILL FORGET THE PLOT, WHO THE MURDERER WAS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE GOD-AWFUL ACTING!

More of a comedy show than a murder mystery, I only remember laughing out loud especially at Steve Martin's and Amy Ryan's love story plot which was soooo funnys...can't believe Steve Martin is still funny I loved him since I was a kid watching Pink Panther so I'm glad to find that I still love his comedy even as an adult! The acting otherwise in the series is very questionable, feels like we're watching a Nickelodeon show, but since the show is lighthearted I feel like perhaps that was intentional to have bad performance like Selina Gomez's acting looks like she is still acting in Wizard of Waverly and that can also be said about other actors in the series as they all were terrible as a whole which could also be down to the implausible plot which made their acting even less convincing! However, all of the horrible acting and even the plots with so many holes were saved by the genius comedy that has been written into and laced throughout the series! I laughed out loud literally so many times than I could count in this show!

Even though the story and acting was below average I will return for future seasons just for the comedy!"
7.0,30 October 2021,
10.0,22 September 2021,"So this is a light crime drama that doesn't follow the same formula that every TV show follows.

The dynamic between the 3 main characters seems to gel better as the episodes progress, I'm keen to see where this goes, and how much life it has for future seasons.

Selena Gomez wasn't someone who I thought would have taken this role, but I think it's a good choice for her. As for the two legends, not a disappointment at all. I'm throughly enjoying seeing these guys back on the screen again."
6.0,29 January 2022,"I love Steve Martin Short. This show had so much potential. Just not quite good enough. Story wasn't well-written enough to be a solid mystery, the comedy wasn't on-point enough to be a solid comedy. Also, does Selena Gomez have another facial expression? I didn't hate it, just was mostly disappointed about how much better it could have been."
5.0,26 August 2023,"OMITB is just so entertaining. I binged watched season 1 and 2 these last few days and I'm so eager to watch season 3. I see there are only 4 episodes out and I stuck between wanting to wait till all episodes are out (because I don't want it to end üò≠) and wanting to jump right on to the next season (because I just can't get enough of it and I can't see myself in the mood to watch anything else).

Funny thing is I don't usually enjoy murder mysteries or even podcasts. But I'm loving everything about this show. The main characters are so entertaining to watch!!! I find myself laughing and laughing and laughing. Chemistry between actors is on point. And oh the soundtrack!!!! The soundtrack!!! There's just something about it that I enjoy so so much."
8.0,5 November 2021,Its simple and its good. .really enjoyed it. ..a different kind of genre....... A light hearted funny suspense thriller...would be looking forward for season 2.
10.0,5 November 2023,"I resisted this show because I have never been a big fan of Martin Short, until now. Dramedy seems to really fit him. I have found myself laughing out loud many times at him. His delivery is impeccable. And his humour is clever, not his typical slapstick humour. (Though in fairness I haven't seen his full repertoire). Steve Martin is quirky and likeable and Selena Gomez is fascinating to watch. She can act, and her unique voice, understated persona and irresistible outfits are all captivating.

If you're out of things to watch as I was, give it a try. You may be pleasantly surprised too. You may even binge it."
8.0,22 June 2022,I don't know what it is about this series that works but it does. It's not solely a mystery and not exactly a comedy. It's like... a cozy mystery. The kind of show you can curl up with on a cold night and a cup of hot chocolate. I cannot wait for Season 2.
9.0,2 October 2024,"This is an amazing series.

It, perhaps, is a bit of a mood thing but the interplay between the three leads, Short, Gomez and Steve Martin is brilliant. Martin Short is particularly spectacular in it. And the Selena Gomez eye-roll and tech savvy young lady is golden. Its just a sensational series. Brilliantly acted and brilliantly filmed and it strikes me as a who's who of broadway actors. I havent done the deep dive on the background of a lot of the actors and actresses. Sensational dialogue and very quick witted with references to other people & actors. You cant make comedy better than this. Really really great. Its superb."
10.0,1 February 2022,"One of the best tv shows i've ever seen, and i've seen many! It had me at the edge of my sit the entire time, i binged the whole thing in one night of how caught in the plot i was! The acting, the cinematography, the character development, the outfits, everything was amazing!"
7.0,22 January 2023,"I enjoyed this a lot. I love that the rowdies are short which is rare these days. Steve Martin and Martin short are hilarious and work so well together!! Selena Gomez was good and the three of them together have great chemistry.

I laughed out loud a few times, and giggled a lot. So many great one liners, mostly by Short.

The mystery was good with lots of twists, it was a fun ride.

A few tiny plot holes but nothing worth noting.

The supporting cast were all quite good too, with lots of fun cameos that I won't ruin in case you aren't aware yet.

This is a cute funny show with mystery that's easy to binge watch ."
8.0,28 September 2021,"I've been wanting to watch this for a while and I'm so glad I have started it!

I've never found Steve Martin so funny!

This is a must!"

5.0,1 October 2021,"If you like silly fantasy plots, cool set design and scenes of NYC, then you might enjoy this. Good cast for sure but they cannot compensate for lame writing. I only watched the first episode but that was enough to put me off. I cannot bear to watch episode 2. Maybe it is trying to be a Wes Anderson type production. If so, it's a miss as I did not even chuckle once.

The only justification I can see for watching this is that there is so little to stream now that is new because of Covid."
10.0,21 November 2023,"Only Murders in the Building is an American comedy mystery television series created by Steve Martin and John Hoffman. The plot follows three strangers, played by Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, all with a shared interest in true crime podcasts, who become friends while investigating suspicious deaths in their affluent Upper West Side apartment building and producing their own podcast about the cases. Its three 10-episode seasons premiered on Hulu in August 2021, June 2022, and August 2023. In October 2023, it was renewed for a fourth season.please watch & enjoy the laughter ride."

10.0,30 October 2022,"Great show, starts abit slow but then it really picks up. It is also corny at times but lessens up after a few episodes.

The story keeps you interested as it is a good mystery, you never quite know who did it or how.

And the cast did a great job of course. Big names actor that pulls the show. Not a fan off Selena but after this I am happily surprised.

Nice life story of people living together and overcoming their personal life difficulties. The show has several layers baked inside the murder mystery.

It is totally worth watching this show as it is easy to watch and follow.

Look forward for more."
8.0,10 January 2022,"What a treat this was!

Wasn't aware of its existence until recently, and being a huge Steve Martin and Martin Short fan, i dove in.

It's a very creative take on a whodunit murder mystery, with interesting characters, good performances and cool twists and turns, and what a joy it was to watch both Steve Martin and Martin Short have a fun time, with great performances. The secondary cast was mostly great as well. Some memorable scenes on some great episodes... Martin Short had me laughing out loud regularly with his shenanigans and outbursts.

The only things i didn't really love, and the reason why my rating isn't higher are a couple of outlandish cameo inclusions and a very monotone, ultra bland Selena Gomez. Maybe her inclusion was aimed to appeal to a particular audience or have a bigger range, but i just felt she was way, way out of her league, and apart from a few of the later episodes where she was better, her acting was not good.

Looking forward to a season 2!"
10.0,29 January 2022,"This was so interesting and witty! The story comes together perfectly with humor, suspense and great acting. Can't wait to see what the next season brings."
10.0,17 January 2022,"While the series has numerous typical NYC characters coming and going, the core three of Martin Short, Steve Martin and Selena Gomez are what makes this series tick. Its beautiful watching Martin's character come alive after suffering some lonely elderly depression. Same with Martin Short's character. While he obviously portrays his life as something much more, you get to really see how much his new friends mean to him. Selena Gomez is perfect in her role and especially how she interacts her ""youth"" with there ""age"". (I think a lot of people are underestimating her role. She is supposed to sound monotone!). She, like her two male counterparts, is doing some soul searching herself and it is warming when she finally admits how much those old guys mean to her."
6.0,23 August 2022,"This is a cool take on the murder mystery genre, with a lot of twists and turns that seemed to never end. It's really satisfying to peel all the layers and watch the main characters go through the same detective like thought process as the viewers.

Just a ""fun"" way to explore an otherwise dark topic. Turns the true crime genre on its head. Not the best for bingeing because it can get tiresome at times."
9.0,26 August 2022,The cast is amazing the comedy is spot on ( not overkill ~ just enough to enjoy it) the mysteries were great w a few twists. The setting is fun!! I can't wait and hope there is a season 3. Steve Martin and Martin short are so funny together and throwing Selena into the mix was genious! This makes me want to live in nyc in a big hotel w a lot of quirky characters!! I keep trying to post this but it keeps telling me my review isn't long enough but I don't want to say anymore bc I don't want to give anything away!! I will say this! Watch it and you won't be disappointed!! I promise!! Ugh tried to submit again and it won't let me because my review is still not long enough!! I binged the first season in one night and I'm in the middle of bringing the second season as we speak!

10.0,21 October 2021,"I honestly didn't know what to expect from this series when I first started watching it, but I thought it was fun and enjoyed the quirky humour.

Whilst Steve Martin and Martin Short were pretty ubiquitous in 80's comedies I haven't seen anything they've done since then, so it was refreshing to see them together again and in something different. Didn't know Selena Gomez beforehand but I liked her character as well (although I couldn't work out if that was her normal voice or just part of the characters deadpan delivery). The rest of the supporting cast were equally engaging.

I don't follow true crime podcasts so I have no idea whether this is a legitimate take on them or not and it may be that a number of in-jokes passed me by as a result, but it was straight forward to follow and a lovely contrast to some of the darker stuff we tend to get now.

I look forward to season 2 and can recommend."
9.0,4 August 2022,"So wonderfully Manhattan, plus comedy, plus murder...what more could you ask? Yes, the language is a bit over the top, but that's part of it's personality. These three main characters are equally my extreme, inner doppelg√§ngers. Of course, Martin Short is my dream neighbor. Lots of cozy murder, startling revelations, and upscale neighborhoods, yet down-to-earth, realness to boot! Watch and love!"
10.0,31 October 2021,"A very smart series full of content.

Well written, original, with continuous twists.

The comic scenes are brilliant, they are almost always funny. In general, during the episodes you smile very often.

The thing I liked the most is that old-fashioned sense of inquiry that pervades the story without ever falling into easy laughter.

Perhaps not the best series of the year but probably the one that surprised me the most."
10.0,9 January 2022,"Can't pick if this show is the best comedy of 2021 or 'The White Lotus'. Such a glorious comeback from Sgt. Bilko! I love Steve Martin! It's the typical whodunit concept but as a comedy series. Its humor is not over-the-top, making it more realistic. I love how it captures the interest of everyone from being an internet sleuth listening to crime podcasts and to being a real-life detective. I for one am guilty of listening and watching crime casts. LOL. Selena Gomez seems stiff, I don't know if that's really part of her role. LOL. I'm glad there's more to this comedy trio in season 2. Does anyone know where can I get a tie-dye sweatshirt of Only Murders in the Building? üòÑ"
8.0,9 August 2022,"I am really enjoying this show, I like the atmosphere, the twists and turns of the story and most of all the characters. I never liked Steve Martin, but here he is awesome. Selena Gomez and Martin Short are also great. I really hope they will continue with this series for many seasons to come."
8.0,20 September 2021,"I liked the shows a lot. Steve Martin is my fav.

The language is too much. Not necessary for all the GD and F words.

Just.... So not necessary.

Not needed at all for the story."
7.0,18 January 2024,"So how do I start telling everyone I like the show? Oh well, I like it. It is a light crime/detective show, like a board game filled with other funny events. I have to admit I was looking for something else but I did not get disappointed after the first episodes. I cannot remember when I saw Steve Martin and Martin Short last time. To be honest I did not even know they were still in the business. Both of them are so genuine and natural and so refreshing. Totally worth spending time watching it and also loved the fact that they attached various artists to the show like Sting and Meryl and Paul.

Well done!"
10.0,23 August 2022,"I absolutely love the show for obvious and aforementioned reasons. It addresses a gamut of social and quasi political issues. It acknowledges an array of personality types, sexual preferences, SE status and I appreciate the show for that. Being in the a degree holder in the industry, I've always had a nostalgic appreciation for Gomez and I love to support her projects (including musical works with multiple black women during her career-most notably Pricilla Rene).

As a straight black woman who avidly watches the show with my black husband, we feel underrepresented and almost tokenized in many episodes (ie the s2 finale). I know these are factors that can easily be rectified and hopefully I'm using this platform appropriately to do so :)"
7.0,7 September 2021,Could have been great with just Steve Martin and Martin Short. Selena Gomez comes across bored with no chemistry with the men. You don't really need her character.
4.0,28 November 2022,"Love Steve & Martin. Glad to see them together again. Did not like the first episode, mentioning ALS. There is no crueler disease in the world. It wasn't portrayed correctly either. The son mentioning that his father wouldn't understand anyway. ALS does nothing to a person's intelligence. Nothing. You are trapped inside your body. I lost a loved one to ALS. Some things should not be joked about. They could have showed how awkward Charles was around people in so many ways. Why use ALS? In spite of my initial reaction, I went back and started watching it again. Steve and Martin together is magic."
8.0,24 December 2023,"Only Murders in the building is an American comedy mystery tv series.

Which consists of 3 series and in the making of series 4 which is to be aired in 2024.

Three strangers share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one.

When I saw the trailer and saw Steve Martin and Martin short are doing a tv series thought this would be good and it was brilliant.

The first series episode one I thought I'm not sure about this, but it does get better you just have to persevere with it every episode gets better and better.

It's cheesy, silly but it works very well.

It is a very different American comedy with a great cast of celebrities as of Selena Gomez, Meryl Streep, Steve Martin, Martin short and Paul Rudd with other famous celebrities along side.

Everyone is just amazing. Steve Martin and Martin short are very talented brilliant actors. Incredible.

The best American comedy since Friends.

It's definitely worth the watch. Its light hearted drama will definitely make you laugh from beginning to end.

Get watching now!

Streaming on Disney Plus."
8.0,19 June 2022,"Yes, yes and yes! This show is epic!!! It has the perfect cast, the story line is so good and enjoyable! All true crime fans/self made investigators will enjoy this series! Can't wait for season 2!"
9.0,16 September 2022,
9.0,21 November 2023,
10.0,10 February 2022,A fun filled story. With a story of crime novel although ending so good and wating to see what happens next. I actually first started watching for selena and then got interesting.
8.0,7 November 2021,"We've been told a story, happens in one of the never expected places in the city, the Arconia, an upper-class residency that only has had a bunch of wealthy, -unsurprisingly, and mostly- old, boring residents, that know nearly anything about each others' lives. Which is a perfect start point for an unusual friendship to be formed: two wealthy (at least they used to be), old white men in their 70's (actually, one of them is in their early 60's) and a pretty, loner girl in her late 20's.

Along with the 'mostly' believable storytelling, some aspects occasionally get in the way of the series after a few episodes; making it hard for me to look at the story as serious or applicable to real-life, and returns these justified expectations that formed in the first few episodes upside down.

Over-caricatured characters that stretch boundaries of their characteristics even more, with every encounter they make with our trio, is not being helpful to this -out of the blue- murder mystery to be more believable or more genuine. It does not make the series worse but doesn't add up much to the tone they were trying to give. Twists, turns, and surprises are the main elements and the touchstones of murder mysteries, but I'd like them to be well-placed to the story, that doesn't show up just because the 'writers' wanted them to be out, but more out of from a natural track. There were a lot of twists in the show, and most of them were not even the subject of being believable or not, no. They could've been seen as believable all day long, that was not the real problem with twists. They were believable, quite applicable most of the time, but the incidents which make these twists occur usually made me question the analytical and deductive skills of our main characters. (Going onto pieces of evidence to discover new leads every 3 episodes just to be in shock and go into a whole new direction was on the edge, and was hardly acceptable for my taste.)

And I know that a good twist -actually any twist- is hard to write. And the watchers, basically don't want any murder mystery to be solved with the first lead the detective, police, or a solver got his/her hand to. So, still a good job on the writers' part to make this story more intriguing and worth watching overall. It was a fun watch. 6/10."
7.0,5 October 2023,"Selena Gomez is a magical elf. She has managed to bring the two old geezers back to life in the best thing they ever did (but I still like Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid)

I loved the musical. It tied into the story in a literary yet silly way. At some points (like the white room) it was even genius.

Season One was clunky and I hated the frozen cat and poisoned dog part. They just couldn't give up cat abuse in Season Two with the allergy thing. Which was the low point of the otherwise much better season where they were more accustomed to their characters.

Season Three was a Tour de Force of buttkickingness!!!

Martin Short's efforts also did not go unnoticed.

***** 8/31/24 update....

I forgot to mention the baby elephant abuse in season 3. I did not like that boyfriend. The magical elf deserved better. Moving on...

I was pleased with the season 4 premiere, even though I don't like Once Upon A Time In The West. I don't have a huge amount of respect for the Western genre, but still there are a few I like. Once Upon A Time In The West is not one of the one's I like. It is pretentious and unfulfilling. I hope Season 4 does not continue with this malarkey, but I remain hopeful even if it does (but they should just drop it). The incinerator scene was incredibly dramatic."
10.0,19 February 2022,
7.0,22 September 2023,"This is a pretty enjoyable show to watch. It's bingeable. The two male actors are really talented, but Selena Gomez ruins the whole show with her absent acting.

I'm tired of this habit of using an actor or actress for an audience, obviously she was used as a hook for younger audiences. There are really talented actors and actresses on the market. Aubrey for example would have been a good choice.

Apart from Selena Gomez's terrible acting, I almost enjoyed the show but to be honest I quit two times to continue again because I wanted to know the end.

I hoped that her character dies somehow or gets in jail so we wouldn't see her anymore or less, but she's a bait for young adults so of course they won't make this.

I did not watch the third season, this was too much to suffer."
1.0,11 February 2022,"What a cool show! I had no idea what to expect when I started it. Was quite sceptical but it really surprised me. The trio's comedic timing is on point, we get Selena's intense acting skills that make you feel things you didn't even know you could feel. Steve and Martin - hilarious but also bring so much soul to the show. Story was enticing, a few cameos that made me excited too! (Hi miss Tina!) Well made!!! Chapeau!"
8.0,28 June 2022,"I adore the offbeat show and for me this is up there with Twin Peaks and the X Files. Casting is superb (except for Amy Schumer in season 2). I love that the quirks and history of the building itself plays a role. Every episode of season one was gold and with only two episodes in season 2, it continues to deliver. This will stand the test of time."
10.0,21 November 2023,"I absolutely love this series. If you want a bit of fun and intrigue than this series is it. Every episode hooks you in with something new and exciting you won't be able to stop watching.

Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez bring this to life with their amazing dynamic. I love that there is this age gap between the characters, it creates some beautiful moments while also being hilarious as these 'old men' try to fit in with the younger crowd.

This 3rd season has been incredibly exciting with a new major setting and even more drama and who better than to bring in Hollywood's best actress, Meryl Streep and suspected vampire, Paul Rudd to star in the show.

Honestly, if you want a bit of a laugh, an easy to watch show that gets you thinking who could it be, than this is it. You will most certainly enjoy yourself. And honestly, who doesn't love it when you put Martin Short and Steve Martin in a room together?"
9.0,24 November 2023,"Some barely plausible characters end up starting a podcast on a murder that happens in the tower block they live in.

I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

*EDIT SEASON 2* Season 2 starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that don't land and Amy Schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party."
8.0,5 September 2021,"It's pronounced Chickashay, Ok. With a long a. Fun show, but a little research goes a long way."
9.0,27 October 2021,"Great fun. The two veterans Short and Martin do their thing. One over the top, Short, the other more dull than he have to. But Selena Gomez make this series really good with her deadpan acting and smartess. She can handle the most wooden lines with panache and get the Rendos on their toes to keep up with her."
6.0,24 July 2022,"This is the first time my husband admires New York through a series. Its take on the chaotic but beautiful scenery of New York is fantastic.

Love the view, the plot is interesting enough to get me hooked. The directing is not so much though. The story jumps around a lot and the pace is quite slow. It does give you a bit of clue along the way but not enough to make any educated guess. So it's a mystery, frankly because they keep it that way, not because it's that hard to crack.

About the cast, im so in love with the dynamic duo ""Brazzo"" and the passionate stage-director. They are fun, classy, and yet chatoic and problematic just like the city itself. The only ""off"" thing for me is Gomez's acting. I know she's going for the ""tough"" and snarky, and not-that-emotional character but it came out plain, stiff, and very confusing to watch.

All in all, the show is cute, worth your time on a slow evening, but I won't put it next to the top murder mystery shows."
9.0,27 November 2023,"Was actually surprised by how much I liked Only Murders in the Building. There's a reason that both seasons have been nominated and won so many awards. The cast (Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, Martin Short) and writing is what makes this show so special. Martin and Short play off one another like the legends they are and Gomez is a lot better actress than I expected. The three of them are just so likable and easy to root for in this series. This show was so good and every episode is so entertaining that I binged both seasons over the course of a weekend. It's a murder mystery show that have been."
7.0,20 November 2021,I was very excited to watch this due to the cast. I felt the first 5 episodes were very slow and boring. It took me about 2 months to get through those. I felt it finally got exciting at episode 6 and I watched the last 5 episodes over about 3 days. Looking forward to a second season.
1.0,30 September 2021,
10.0,17 February 2024,"I really love Martin Short and Steve Martin. Selena is great in anything she is in. I would have rated it higher but the Profanity seems senseless. It's just stuck in there for no reason. I guess to appeal to generation Z? Just insert beeeeepppp every time you hear a word that offends you! Anyway, the story revolves around three people that lives in the same building trying to solve a murder of someone they all knew. For some reason it's up to them to solve the crime without any police intervention. None of them seem to be crime fighters, but still they have been enlisted to solve the crime.

Part of the fun is that there are many cameos by stars that you don't expect but do know from many other shows you may have watched in the past. If you like humor of Martin Short and Steve Martin you will enjoy this."
9.0,18 November 2021,"This show is an example of how unprogressive and outdated television can be.

They should should have used every opportunity to be as a woke as possible. - Shame."
8.0,14 November 2021,It would be a lot better than if there wasn't as many f-bombs. 1 per episode max but there's like 3 to ten per episode that's insane. I really loved it but I do not like swearing to me there are much better was to show that your upset other than saying the f-bomb an that is all.
10.0,20 July 2022,"Just commenting because I'm annoyed by all of the recent reviews. This show is great. It's a farce; it's a play in tv series form. Expand your willingness to embrace theater and for the folks older than me in my 40s, calm the F down - sexuality is a spectrum and it's weird if Amy Schumer occupied that much of your mind. Like really, get a life."
8.0,11 October 2024,
9.0,16 November 2021,"Before viewing this series, I had no prior experience listening to True Crime podcasts. After 10 episodes of ""Only Murders in the Building"", I'm satisfied that this show was a first real taste for me in the world of True-Crime. The light hearted note of the show which over arches some serious themes, gives this show a unique flavour. Production value is impressive. But it all comes down to the iconic duo - Steve and Martin. Great delivery of their respective characters. Also, it was throwback for me seeing Selena back on TV screen. I found her to be reasonably well for her acting, but some spark was missing in her.

Overall, I would recommend this show. The first 2 to 3 episodes will either make or break this show for the viewers.

Update - Season 2 So this show has taken jump from 7/10 to 8/10 considering both the seasons together. Wonderful and beautiful cast."
6.0,5 September 2024,"Funny and entertaining series with a quirky style. The New York building set up is interesting and most of the characters are engaging. The story is told from different points of view and has a lot of twists and turns and that keeps it from getting boring even if sometimes it gets too much.

Acting is all very good with the big exception of the Mabel character. That girl can so not act, she comes out as almost expressionless. It's such a shame because the character could make a great trio with the two older guys. Was it really so hard to find a fresh, funny face to compliment two great comedians? It bothers me in every episode because it could be so much better with a better female protagonist."
8.0,23 August 2023,"As charming, funny, and clever as ever. This time around, the victim is Ben, a Broadway neophyte who apparently dies during his opening night performance--but doesn't--only to perish, rather horribly, later on. Our intrepid trio of podcasting sleuths is on the case immediately--namely, of course, Martin Short (the frazzled director of the show), Steve Martin (one of the vic's more unwilling co-stars), and Selena Gomez (due to move out of her apartment shortly, and ready for one last crime-solving adventure). Look for a bunch of new faces, the usual amount of funny one-liners and razor-sharp repartee, and, naturally, an assortment of carefully placed clues--some of them red herrings, others legit. Paul Rudd plays the outwardly unlikeable but inwardly troubled Ben; Meryl Streep is the show's sweetly humble (at least so far) leading lady. Which member of the company--each of whom, it seems, had something against Ben--did the evil deed? The show biz jokes are back, too, and watching Short share camera time with Streep--and fall for her--is a joy. If the first four episodes of the third season are any indication, this is one building that remains a nice place to visit...but you still wouldn't want to live there. (Added bonus: Michael Cyril Creighton hosts a ""Talking Dead""-type post-show chatfest called ""One Killer Question"", in which Creighton and a couple of his castmates discuss the week's episode. Stick around for it--it's almost as much fun as the show itself.)"
6.0,22 July 2022,"I'm only half way through the first season but I am really shocked by how well Short, Martin and Gomez work together. Usually the boomer/millennial discourse jokes never land well but this series managed to create such a refreshing dynamic between the three leads.

Martin Short plays Oliver, an eccentric theatre director/writer who hasn't been able to catch a break after many failed projects, while Steve Martin plays a former D-list actor called Charles who can't seem to let go of the past. Selena Gomez then rounds off the trio as a much younger guest of her Aunts' in the building that Oliver and Charles live in. All three characters share a passion for a Whodunit-style murder mystery podcast, hosted by Tina Fey, before starting their own podcast following a shocking death in the building. Even though they're working together it's obvious that the three leads all have separate agenda's associated with solving the mystery and creating the podcast.

Short and Martin are particularly engaging in this series as the trio interview the building's tenants to try and find the murderer. Gomez does seem a bit flat in her acting style initially but I just choose to attribute that to the characterisation of Mabel. I found that once I got over that mental-block I really started to enjoy her character, and I cannot emphasise enough how surprised I was to see Short, Martin and Gomez have such good chemistry. All of the characters seem to have a great backstory and many secrets that come to head as the show progresses.

There's definitely some good laughs in here too and I was delighted to see a fan favourite from the office Amy Ryan show up in the last few episodes I watched!

As someone who gets easily freaked out by true crime stories I find this series much more digestible with its lighthearted humour and heartfelt relationships between characters. This is probably the only 'feel good' murder mystery series I've seen that's actually of good quality.

I really like the idea that you can create a pseudo-family within your community and 'Only Murders in the Building' really hits home with that sentiment."
1.0,31 October 2021,"Not a comedy, Neither a Thriller, Nor a Investigation, Just bunch of mixed stuff here and there. And the ending what the heck is that. Could have done better."
8.0,8 November 2021,"The story is really gripping, though a bit cliche - keeps you engaged.

I feel the characters could have been explored more regarding their traits and background.

Hoping for a season 2."
9.0,2 June 2022,Season 2 premiere is June 28!!! And I hope it will be even better than season 1. Loved the first 6 episodes. They were very smartly made. I want to see the creators and cast taking more risks with the show. To be more spooky and adventurous.
10.0,25 October 2021,The production and the cast is superb. Great story plot. While it is not the best true crime tv show it's it's good enough to be expecting a Season 2. I must say each and every one of The episodes is visually stunning.
8.0,22 October 2021,"A very predictable show with some mediocre moments yet very enjoyable to watch. I didnt find any episode boring and the quirky soundtrack added to the aura to the show. All in all a basic, but very enjoyable show, one to watch with the family."
9.0,19 February 2022,"Not going to play it down and be cool in my review this was absolute perfection in my opinion. I LOVED IT!

If like me, you have a penchant for true crime podcasts or the genre in general, this show nails the current love and popularity (and in some cases down-right obsession) the modern world has for theses stories. Mix that with the true legendary Hollywood and comedy talent of Steve Martin and Martin Short, and then add a splash of the gorgeous, and I'll confess truly delightful Selena Gomez, and you've nailed it.

Yes, at first I was concerned that Steve Martin and Martin Short might be a negative aspect as I haven't really seen them in much since their hey day movies of the 80's and 90's, but I was completely wrong. They both gave, for me, such personable and likeable portrayals of their characters. They were funny, weird, campy and vulnerable in all the right places. I liked Selena Gomez too and was fascinated by her super deep sexy voice. They all have great chemistry together and couple that with a lovely set location and it really worked me for.

I liked the format used with narration overlay by the characters in the style of true podcasting shows and add some quirky music and you've got a nice authentic feel to the episodes.

Story arc was good and well mapped and supporting characters and characters side stories gave it some real heart. Nice twists and turns heading into the season finale and you've got me ready and waiting for season 2."
9.0,23 September 2021,"I found the story entertaining. Martin Shorts character is a mess, not my favorite. Selina Gomez acting is mediocre and flat, not sure if that's the character or not. I do like the idea of her character and I'm neither a fan nor a hater of Selina herself.

My biggest gripe is the constant use of the F-Bomb in every episode 1-3, and by so many characters. I'm just not a fan of that word or swearing in general. It's not SO commonly OR Frequently used by MOST people in life in general... and those that do make themselves sound ignorant. Why the writers feel the need to put it in is beside me. It's absolutely NOT necessary. Not only does it NOT add anything, it takes away.

I'm not likely to continue watching nor to recommend for that simple fact. Too bad!"
6.0,10 January 2022,"When I first heard about Selena Gomez starring alongside Steve Martin and Martin Short, I was hesitant to pull the trigger on watching this series. However, I am glad I decided to watch a couple episodes on a whim because my wife and I were immediately hooked. Each cast member brings a unique quality to their character and they do a tremendous job of keeping every scene interesting. This was the best new series I encountered in all of 2021 and would recommend to anybody looking for a new fun show to watch, especially for people who love mystery-comedies or true crime series/podcasts ."
8.0,18 November 2021,"Edit: the last about 15 minutes in the show knocked it down from a 10 to an 8 for me. The ending kinda ruined it for me - it just didn't make much sense. Looking forward to seeing how everything is resolved in season 2!

Proves that a show can be silly while being socially conscious. Absolutely brilliant. Very ""Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew""esque. Laughed, cried, whole 9 yards. Think the Supernatural episode where they go to the Sam/Dean role playing convention."
6.0,25 October 2021,"The the boring and the saddest actors ever, together for the most boring comedy ever. I dont even get why the girl was casted... She should play some sad drugs addict."
5.0,19 July 2022,"Just a really good old-fashioned murder mystery with original storytelling. Love the quirky, hilarious characters that make up the tenants of the Arconia building/suspect roster each season. Not to mention the amazing, stellar stars of the show that bring so much charm, and so many laughs. I should point out that writing reviews is not something I do. In fact, I think this is my very first one in the 20+ years I've been coming to IMDb. But I just love this show so much, and sadly Hulu doesn't do enough to spread the word, I just HAD to leave a review. Who knows though... maybe I'll start learning more reviews of shows/movies."
8.0,12 May 2022,"I was very pleasantly surprised as how good Only Murders in the Building was. It actually got better as it went along, mainly because Martin Short is just excellent - brilliantly caustic lines, delivered with exquisite timing. Well worth watching if just for him!"

9.0,12 May 2022,"Martin Short and Steve Martin have not lost a bit of their skill. No shade meant to Selena Gomez, but how did she end up with the privilege?

Its a great premise and execution is brilliant so far!"
8.0,16 January 2022,"Wonderfully directed .great actors that can give the ability to surprise to director.

The simplicity behind all the mystery has really given the show value to be watched."
8.0,22 November 2022,
7.0,25 October 2021,"In an era when everything seems to be a remake, reboot, or based off a graphic novel, Only Murders is a breath of fresh air.

The characters are engaging and well developed and the story itself is well paced. Each episode moves the plot along, which is someone unique. Normally over 10 episodes there's at least one episode that really just spins its wheels.

The cast is great. Steve Martin, Martin Short and Nathan Lane all shine, and the supporting cast all bring something fun to the table. The only ones that stand out in a negative way would be Selena Gomez - who just cant hold up against her peers in such a key role - and Detective Williams, who came off as flat.

As far as the whodunnit, I wont spoil it, but this is not an out of left field answer where the killer is shoe-horned in at the minute. The clues are there and mystery buffs should be satisfied with the conclusion.

I'm looking forward to season 2."
8.0,31 October 2021,"It's a bit of fun and a bit of mystery. Some characters didn't have to exist. Some storylines don't make a whole lot of sense. Kudos for keeping the episodes rather short though, and individual acting was excellent, and it had its funny moments. I'm not sure a second season is needed though."
7.0,14 September 2021,"I like the actors in the show, but the plot is so boring and so low, I'm trying so hard to get through these episodes but I just wanna quit watching all the time... Was looking forward to Selena's performance, but sadly very disappointed :( Cannot understand who would rate this serie over 7."
3.0,6 December 2022,"This show is amazing. It's funny, quirky and best of all; original. The interactions between the 3 main characters Oliver, Charles and Mabel seems a bit odd in the beginning but just gets better with each episode. Sometimes the show has a moment of absurdity but after a while you just take it as a cool quirk. The build up to the unraveling of the crime is well done and the-who-done-it part was exciting and fun. The second season involves another murder but somehow they managed to make it all (somewhat) believable. The first episode can seem bit much but hang in there, it's totally worth it. I'm going to watch it again, that says a lot!"
10.0,18 May 2022,"Sit back and enjoy

Smart, funny, safe but will surprise with an edge

Steve Martin , Martin Short and Selina Gomez

Steve Martin superbly plays an understated Steve Martin

Martin Short is excellent and plays himself with his superb timing and restrained whacky humour

Selina Gomez I have never found to be particularly engaging but suits this role perfectly as someone who does not want to be engaging but cannot help herself.

Recommended."
10.0,18 May 2022,"I never thought the trio containing two famous comedians, i.e. Steve Martin and Martin Short, and Selena Gomez is one of the things I needed in this world! I've watched some mystery and crime movies and series and I found Only Murders in the Building truly fascinating. It's fresh. The concept, the comedy, the way they portrayed the city of New York and its occupants. It's a must watch!"
10.0,6 February 2022,"Despite Selena Gomez' horrid acting, this show was a blast to watch. The ending was a bit confusing to my wife and I, perhaps a segue into next season? Twists and turns galore, with plenty of quick witted humor and physical comedy. I highly recommend this show."
10.0,20 November 2023,"I resisted for a long time because I really didn't want to suffer through some Lifetime-style old person's ""comedy/mystery"". I was fearing watered down humor, style and depth. But, then I remembered that I've loved everything that Martin Short has done all the way back to Jackie Rogers Jr.! I took a chance and now I'm on episode 7 and dying to watch more!

Brilliant concept with absolutely fantastic onscreen charm between the three lead actors. They're all going full bore into this and it shows. I'm laughing out loud every couple minutes!! And the minutes that I'm not laughing, I'm engaged in the story and mystery. Each character, even side ones, have depth.

I'm actually quite surprised at how much I like Steve Martin's character and his performance. I used to like his comedy records, but never really kept up on his films (straight up comedy movies are not my thing, unless they're from the 1930s), so he's the real winner here for me.

I've little idea who Salena Gomez is, other than I've maybe heard her name. But, she's great! Perfect delivery and she fits the character like a glove. Funny as heck!

The Sting stuff had me rolling on the floor laughing. The neighbors in the building are all equally goofy and fun. Oh, and Tina Fey is solid!

All in all, I'm anxious to keep watching; which NEVER happens with me and comedy TV! Great stuff!"
8.0,29 January 2022,"I watched the whole thing in one sitting.. beautiful chemistry between cast members which is to be expected since Steve Martin and Martin Short are fabulous comedians. Selena Gomez is also really really good in it and all the protagonists together make a great mystery solving team. Since i am a true crime fan myself the story line was very interesting and entertaining to watch. Also, beautiful intro with a lovely soundtrack and aesthetically pleasing atmosphere throughout the whole first season. Definitely worth a try!!!!!"
10.0,24 October 2021,"Good light hearted fun, not laugh out loud funny though. The true killer was somewhat predictable. Overall a fun, quick watch. The best part was all the dope apartments."
7.0,5 October 2021,"We enjoy binge watching these, since they are so short. Don't take this series seriously, and you'll enjoy it, too! Fun to see Nathan Lane in this kind of a role, the gimmick of a silent episode, and Steve Martin and Martin Short clearly enjoying themselves."
8.0,23 September 2021,"Engaging, interesting, and good choice of actors but every character is foul mouthed."
7.0,31 October 2021,"I watched 2 episodes and couldn't go on, so dull and not amusing at all. Maybe there is something hidden after but I just couldn't wait. I don't understand the very high reviews for a series considered to be a crime thriller."
5.0,8 October 2022,"What are the classic murder mystery series components?

1. There should be a death in first part (ticked) 2. There should be investigators one trying to close the case ( in this case police) and one seeing something fishy (in this case the trio of Mabel,putnut and brazzos) 3. There should be suspects changing in each episodes (ticked) 4. In most of the cases the investigators have their own mental/family issues , examples are Broadchurch, The fall, Happy Valley and so many (Here also three main characters have that) So what makes only murders in the building interesting ? The answer is prop used here is unique as it doesn't depend upon Police or CIA or some crime branch its the people who are making the podcasts and the second is its comic touch because there is steve martin,martin short off course.

Lovely watch, I am already glued for season 1."
8.0,24 December 2021,"I love seeing Steve Martin and Martin Short together but if you just use their last names, you'll only get Martin Short. Fun little romp that I imagine was spark in the mind of Steve Martin after listing to a True Crimes podcast. Sting is absolute hysterical. Selina Gomes fits in nicely with the two older gents. Just a lot of fun and looking forward to more seasons (if they come up with a plausible storyline)"
10.0,30 June 2022,"Fresh, funny crime drama with awesome cast and cameo appearances like Sting, Tina Fey, Amy Schumer, Shirley MacLaine et al and an wonderful ensemble cast. Steve Martin and Martin Short are brilliant - as always- dishing out comedy with a delicious twist. Selena Gomez is a terrific addition and a surprisingly good fit to their podcast threesome. Looking forward to many more episodes- totally love this show!!!"
8.0,8 November 2021,"Very clever premise, great chemistry, perfect whodunit, but come on - why so much profanity!? Totally unneeded and distracting. Time it down next season, please!!!"
8.0,6 November 2021,"Series starts slow for the first two episodes. Then in the middle it got some pace and mystery was unfolding. But was it really ?

And then in the end episodes - it turns out just freaking amazing. Loved it. Never expected this much but yeah it turend out so good. After knives out this is something i was looking for."
8.0,22 October 2021,"Giving my review after the whole 10 episode of 1st season. English is my second language ( I dont have even official examination and graduation of English ), but closing to 60 y.o, a have developped lots of criticism.

And after these facts I am looking forward watching 2nd season.

There is out a big number of crime series and miniseries- absolutlely good or excellent heartbreaking and tragic. But: hey, sometimes "" girls just wonna have fun"" -even if crime serie junkies.

Cast: SM had some really wonderful classic films. Still love him. MS - seen less films, maybe not among the best comedians, here he was more than average. Sel. Gom. - I knew of her. Now listened some songs from Greatest Hits, for me garbage. But: as to her acting- I really liked her. I mean with a good script/ character she is really good.

Story: considering that main caracters are all crime fans/ junkies, they are crap with police procedures. I could easily skip this fact. If it's for fun, who cares ?

I've been watching/experiencing an ""out of the box"" fun series what I really liked ( and I really dislike boxing anyone or anything).

Dear people, try a few episodes .Or just quit it. Anyway, I keep all my fingers and toes crossed for series 02. Viva diversity !"
8.0,3 March 2024,This is a truly tremendous series for all viewers to watch and enjoy. The crew did a remarkable job in creating this series. They certainly knew what they were doing. The storyline of this series was strong and great. It held itself throughout the entire series. The cast selection throughout this series was huge and strong. They all completely committed and connected to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members was really strong and solid. This series reveals to viewers what teamwork can really do for the world of today. No one really knows what is out there in the world of today. This is a sensational series for everyone to watch.
6.0,31 January 2023,
10.0,8 June 2023,"Let's face it, the murder mysteries premise is a cover for comedy. With Martin and Short why waste your time.

Too bad Selena is then left to be the 'straightman'.

I'm glad a season is not 15 episodes because murder mysteries do require a lot of characters to produce a lot of red herrings. And that would have to be really dragging the plot out.

To spice up season 2, many returns and connections was made to season 1. That is reasonable but it also seems to just to pad and fill. The building setting restrictions came into used a bit. But for sure it need to branch out of the clausophobia. I wish it could be a little smarter like the other great show, Mrs. Davis."
6.0,10 April 2023,"I'm amazed at how high this is rated here, but I guess it's just not for me. Comedy Mystery is one of my wife and I's favorite categories, so we thought it would be a perfect match to our taste. I love Steve Martin and Martin Short and, going in, had no real opinion on Selena Gomez (other than her being easy on the eyes). I've watched three episodes and have found the pacing to be slow, the style much too artsy for my taste, the story to be more about character drama than the mystery, and, most unfortunately, Selena's acting to be quite bad. I really wanted to like it, but don't think I'll be watching it any further. My wife isn't as bored with it as I am, but she's not in love with it either. I expect she'll see it through during her workouts."
1.0,13 August 2023,"Just binch watched season 2 and season 3 upto the current episode. Absolutely love this series, the cast and their portrayed personalities. I love how you have to keep watching and quessing the killer. Somehow the trio dynamic works and I love how Selenas character brings youthful edge to the old farts who are brilliant in their own right. I also love how every season the penthouse quest changes and eagerly wait who is it this time. I can see more and more popular mainstream actresses and actors to join the cast of new season, but love hoe they keep the original characters live aa well. Highly recommend üëå"
6.0,14 July 2022,"I get it now. Martin Short being anoying...that's the bit! His ability to turn every confersation in a opportunitie to name drop is admerible and funny. 'the Vincent is silent ' left me almost rolling of the chair. I was in love with Steve Martin in every movie sinds i was a teenager. His typical faces and understated humor still makes me happy. The perfect timing of the two icons makes this play a classic comedy. Lifted Llto today by Celena gomez, as the modern, graceful centerpiece. Great acting all around in this ""whait, who went thru which door?"" type of play. I love every bit of it. And don't forget the guest roles. Every one of them is famous! Thank you guys."
3.0,12 May 2022,"This caught me by surprise. I was expecting something silly or mediocre, but it was riveting! I live the title sequence, the music, the colors, the dialogs, the surprises, the twists, the humanity. And I love podcasts so this clicked as well.

Well done."

5.0,8 November 2021,"Now I love old school Steve Martin and Martin Short, but nostalgia funny and actual funny are two different things. And they did something for Netflix recently that was totally lost on me, not even a chuckle. But this was more back to their roots, situational comedy, low key and more about plot. I'm not a Selema Gomez fan, honestly I couldn't name one song of hers, but she is a great actress. She holds her own in the middle of two giants. I just really liked her, and Martin and Short didn't go for cheap laughs and opted for more intellectual puns. I really enjoyed this series a lot."
4.0,10 June 2022,"Wow! I am shocked that there are some negative reviews for this gem of a show! I found out about this show by accident, and it turned out to be an awesome find! I am so glad there will be a season 2 starting on June 28th! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! TWO THUMBS UP!"
1.0,6 October 2021,"This show is fun, light-hearted and enjoyable! And just when we all really need it. No agendas or propaganda here! It's such a breath of fresh air! And, this is the best thing I have seen Martin and Short in for a very long time! Kudos!"
2.0,6 November 2022,"It's been a while since I've watched a TV series- and smiled at the end of it! What a thrilling, colourful, creative, warm and smartly written piece of dramatic-comedy. The Martin & Short duo are always a hit for any audience but for me a previous admirer of both their projects, respectively it was truly enjoyable to see them on screen united again. I'd never watched Selena Gomez in film of TV, so now I think she is an excellent addition, smart, grounded, staunch yet her story added delicate and tender moments to the plot. I was thoroughly entertained by this mystery- I couldn't fault anything about it!"
4.0,21 November 2023,"The movie reveals between three persons who live in same apartments. The persons were be as to each other . They didn't know that they will e revealing in the murder later .

It was a perfect movie which entertains many around us . The applause to the movie was good . It was very nice and good through out. The movie is good to watch but the strangers met in the struggle sets were they were involved in the murder and not able to come out if that . The movie was action to many people in the world . The movie was entertaining audiences well.

Comic sense was missing in the movie but it was good to watch movie."
2.0,21 December 2023,"I've watched the first 2 seasons. It *should* be funny given the cast. Steve Martin has done some great work over the years. Unfortunately, it just isn't funny. It's barely amusing. One assumes it's being made because of some sort of ""emperor's new clothes"" scenario where the studio just don't want to admit it's a bit rubbish because of the names involved. Maybe, US audiences do find this funny - after all they loved Friends and the US version of The Office (and someone keeps Adam Sandler in work)? I keep expecting a laugh but have watched more in hope than expectation. A waste of talents and a waste of my time."
4.0,17 November 2021,"Stumbled across this as I needed a new comedy to watch. Whilst this is funny in places I wouldn't class it as an all out comedy This is a drama firstly with a few comedic scenes thrown in, but it is definitely worth watching."
3.0,25 November 2023,"Charles ,Oliver and Mabel are one of the best created characters on Tv right now. I really love how they pull each other's leg and keep annoying each other. I loved all three seasons but the 3rd one is by far the best one . The whole musical theater scenerio with a huge side characters was so perfectly handled. This show is unlike any other professional type detective shows out there. Charles-Mabel-Oliver are as flawless and normal and quirky as anyother normal human being .The humor is top notch . There are so many scenes which make you gag and laugh hysetrically. I haven't found any episode dry or boring . Every episode is superbly written and well crafted. A must watch for crime junkies !!"
4.0,7 November 2021,"Only a few episodes in, but I love this! I've always been a Steve Martin fan, and he delivers. I love how the trio of character balance each other out with the conflicting ages, personalities, and lifestyles that are all drawn together by their love of true crime. The twist at the end of the first episode was enough to draw me in!

I also grew up watching Selena Gomez on Disney, so it's nice to see her act in a show for an adult audience."
4.0,17 January 2023,
4.0,7 October 2021,"This show is very good, as the episodes go the story gets more interesting with a very modern podcast wrapped in it and doesn't make it bad for the story itself (usually a bit lacking if you bring the current set of stories), good acting only sometimes they don't feel good in some episodes (it depends on the rating respectively) and selena gomez not bad. Hope it's better and puzzles in season 2."
2.0,31 October 2021,This was a fun show and the low reviews are wrong. Selena Gomez took some getting used to but Martin Short is just absolutely fantastic! It's worth the watch.
4.0,10 December 2021,
1.0,18 November 2023,"""Only Murders in the Building"" swiftly captures attention with its mix of comedic detective thrills. The show's play between mystery and humor hooked me from the start and kept me engaged throughout. Initially drawn in by the first season's opening episode, I found myself not compelled to return to the series after the pilot. This could be because of the low emotional connect.

Although the notable strength of this series lies in its pacing, ensuring there are no dull moments. However, this brisk rhythm sometimes hinders the development of emotional connections with the characters as discussed earlier. There was an attempt in the latest season to address this shortfall but it slightly altered the thrill factor, affecting the gradual buildup that some viewers appreciated less, but it didn't affect me. I found it good enough.

The writers faced with a challenge: striking a balance between emotional resonance and a fast-paced narrative. Finding this in a balance is tricky. Ultimately, the series leans more towards the thrilling detective elements, delivering a well-wrapped mystery bundle.

""Only Murders in the Building"" excels as a multifaceted production, blending thriller, comedy, detective work, and drama. Its broad appeal resonates across various audiences, marking it as a must-watch. I just want more of it. Keep it going.

RECOMMENDED."
3.0,4 February 2023,"The plot of this series is a good one, some unsuspecting characters stumble into a murder investigation. The characters are well acted, and the writing of their backstories is excellent. The one thing that sticks in my craw is the way the writers treat true crime podcast fans. It's kind of obvious that they have never listened to a true crime podcast in their lives as they depict true crime podcast fans as something like modern day Trekkies. I don't doubt that there would be a podcast about the crimes in the series, or that the characters themselves would try like they do to make one, but that they would have fans camping outside the building, or stalking them in restaurants? Absurd."
5.0,2 July 2022,"Boring, doesn't leave you wanting to see more, just a total waste of time... I do not recommend it at all and I would hope that they could improve the characters that are so mediocre."
4.0,29 October 2021,"A 6,5 is more like it. First 2 episodes were unfunny. Glad I kept watching. Martin Short is an absolute delight, last 2-3 episodes he had me in stitches!

Other than him, script can take some major improvements."
2.0,18 August 2024,"This was one of the most boring shows I saw in the recent times. I cannot understand what people saw..

Do not watch it and help increase its view count or ratings .

The acting is bad. All the three main people give average performances. The storyline is nothing special. Just a few guys trying to do a true crime podcast. Music is okay. Pretty classy and different actually. So are the modern graphics. The cinematography is cool but nothing out of the box. The suspense and build up is mediocre. No edge of the seat moments or cliffhangers. I just don't see what's the big deal. There are no witty one liners or any humor to make up for the lack of entertainment.

I saw some people commenting that the ratings are courtesy Selena Gomez. You fans should not mess up the ratings and misguide innocent, happy people to watch these unhappy shows.

Listen to Sherlock & Co. On Apple Podcasts instead. It's way better and actually deserves these ratings.."
4.0,6 May 2023,"After watching the first episode of season 1, I don't think I can go on. Slow, boring, wooden acting, and really just not worth the time. There are much better shows out there. Others say skip season 2, I say skip season 1 also. If season 1 is this bad, I can't even begin to imagine how bad is 2. And what's with the annoying music? I don't know much miss Gomes singing, but I have to assume she is a much better singer than actor. So I would say stick to singing. As a huge fan of the other two, I am disappointed. They both can do better. They both have done better. But I guess we all need money at some point and will just what it takes to collect a pay check. This show is it."
2.0,21 August 2022,"Isn't Selena Gomez happy with what she's good at doing- singing? Please why her? Her wooden face just remains the same, no reaction. On top of that the nasal tone! Maybe reese Witherspoon or Zoe Saldana could've been the third person in the team!?"
2.0,17 May 2024,"Big fan of beloved Steve Martin and I watched all his films up until 2000s. They're all outstanding flicks that I enjoy revisiting. Martin Short is also an unforgettable iconic comedian. His Saturday night show sketches are unforgettable. So I was so psyched to watch this show when I saw the cast. Unfortunately I barely made it to the end of the first episode. I'm a mystery fan and NYC is my second home..so again in the beginning I was so excited as both genre and location felt so close to heart. For me major disappointment is the plot. I mean the mystery element appeared too 'manufactured' and 'imposed upon viewer' even if it is not gripping enough in essence. Just not engaging enough. It lacks the level of sophistication required to make it intriguing.

Dialogues are less than witty and humour falls far from sarcasm. Mostly sounding corny. Perhaps I found it flat because I'm more of a black comedy lover. Mystery factor faded away underneath sitcom appeal. Plus Selena Gomez's poor monotone performance didn't help."
2.0,8 September 2021,The waning of past talent. Two comedians whose time has past and are no longer funny or even slightly entertaining.
2.0,6 September 2021,"I really wanted to like this show, but it's pretty much impossible for me.

The main characters are all loaded with baggage that just takes away from the story. In fact, as I watched each of the three episodes so far, I liked the main characters less in every episode. Martin Short's character is just a revolting human being. Steve Martin isn't the least bit funny and his performance is flat. Selena Gomez is cold and overly judgmental. They just don't seem to be people that can come together successfully as a team. I find it hard to care about any of them and I think that's essential for the series to be successful.

Frankly, for Martin Short and Steve Martin, it seem like a last desperate gasp for relevance. Sad.

I'm obviously an outlier on this one. Glad so many of you like it but it's not for me."
4.0,19 November 2021,"I love two Martins but Selena just can't act. She is just saying the lines with a monotone voice. Premise is good and it had a potential, but with some other female character, in her 40's ... it would have been a way better."
5.0,3 September 2021,"Unless you want to be ""shocked"" by Selena Gomez dropping f-bombs every other sentence. Two episodes was as much time as I will waste."
1.0,5 September 2022,"After revealing that Short's character doesn't lock his front door Gomez's character supposedly makes a hilarious quip, ""I guess old White guys only have to worry about colon-cancer and societal change"". Before you label me whatever you will, I actually have called people out on white male privilege more than you think, but when it makes sense. Doing so when it does not weakens its meaning and impact. Have these two old white guys said or done anything dated or offensive in this show so far? No! It might make sense if one of them was more like Archie Bunker, but obviously Short or Martin could not pull that off. It also doesn't make sense regarding race, unless you invent a problem of people of color being targeted more often for home invasion in such a neighborhood. It may actually be the opposite. If they simply left it at male privilege without the unnecessary adolescent and out-of-nowhere ageist insult it would have fit with Gomez's character background better, and at least made some sense. Yes, you forget about ageism, you supposed know-it-alls. It's almost as if some clown made them add ""white"" to the line because that's just the thing to do. Horrendous writing and storytelling. Lastly, watching a mediocre actor like Steve Martin trying to act as if he is a bad voice actor is just not funny and boring."
1.0,17 September 2021,Gomez kills the whole show. They would have been better off if they went with an unknown actress that actually has talent.
5.0,12 September 2021,"Sorry folks. Definitely doesn't deserve a 8.4/10 It's barely funny, barely intriguing, and barely thrilling."
1.0,13 October 2023,"Enjoyed season 1 & 2 but season 3 has lost the plot.

I would agree with other posters, too much use of the F word, this has really made it tacky. Plus the singing theme, omg, just plain boring.

Also the over acting from Martin Short, Meryl Stink and other nobodies.

I dealt with Meryl Stink by fast forwarding every time she appeared.

The only good parts are Selena Gomez and Steve Martin except for their over use of the F word. Use the F word sparingly for maximum impact , but when used every second sentence, just plain tacky, very tacky. No class. The director is a moron and just following the idiot trend set by the other morons."
3.0,2 October 2021,"This should have been a fun show but is unfortunately is pretty dull. Steve Martin plays a tired old actor as a tired old actor, Martin Short is annoying playing an annoying theatre director and Selena Gomez plays a non-actor well as a non-actor."
3.0,16 December 2021,I love Martin Short and Steve Martin so was looking forward to watching this. I only got as far as the second episode before I picked up my phone as started surfing internet as I was bored. Stopped watching after that.
1.0,9 January 2022,The writing is. Just. So. Bad. Couldn't make it through the first episode. They immediately share deep life stuff and want to solve true crime stuff together? No.
5.0,9 August 2023,"I was looking forward to season 3, but I could barely get through the first two episodes. There are WAY TOO MANY ""F"" Bombs. SO many ""F"" bombs that it seriously distracted from the show itself. PLUS, the. Innuendo's in the script hinting to the show actually BEING a show were way too many, and again took away from the show. It was so annoyingly bad bad and distracting that I must have stopped and restarted the episodes 3 or 4 times, and I'm still not finished with the first two episodes, and it's ONLY a 1/2 show!!! Also, Sorry. Only Murders in the Building is just no where near as good as the first two seasons. Far from it..."
1.0,14 September 2021,"Each week less and less information is revealed. Jessica Fletcher could have had this all buttoned up in an hour. Instead we have an actress who sounds like a Muppet and whose emotional range is from deadpan to bored, but swears to let us know there's some passion somewhere inside her. Steve Martin is not far behind her. Martin Short's goofy, over-the-top performance is the show's only saving grace. The storyline is so slow that I no longer care who killed Tim Kono, and instead hope he/she kills the remaining cast as well."
2.0,10 September 2021,"In the golden age of television, this should have aimed higher, with laughs for starters, since this is supposed to be a comedy. The dialogues are good and the mystery unfolds nicely, my biggest problem was with Selena Gomez who I'm sure was brought to balance the old timers, which they didn't need and brings absolutely NOTHING to the table. She emotes NOTHING, communicates nothing and gives no clues as to what Mabel is thinking, feeling or even saying, since her deadpan delivery is just dead.

I was drawn to this because it felt retro and fun but it's just uninmaginative and takes no risks."
4.0,11 October 2021,"I was really looking forward to this and was hugely dissappinted. I see how they were trying to develop a murder mystery theme, and the podcast was a nice modern twist seen how we are all on social media these days but it was just missing something and fell very flat. I liked the two males but Selena was so one lifeless, I don't remember her acting being this stiff ,however I last watched her on the Disney channel so my reference point for her acting skills is not the strongest lol. Maybe if she was cast with someone else it would've created more spark between the three but this aspect really put me off getting past the 2nd episode.

The show is also quite boring it doesn't flow, I can't see how the reviews have been so positive and it got picked up for a second season but I suppose when big names are backing the show anythings possible :/"
1.0,29 July 2022,Might like this show is not for Selena Gomez. She doesnt even seem like she wants to be there. Her voice sounds like a kazoo. Her whole attitude is blah. She ruins every scene. I dont understand why she gets casted in anything. Sorry.
2.0,21 November 2023,"It is not for every one but for a fan of ""old school review"" comedy you don't see much nowadays this is a pinch of nostalgia that works some of the time.

Steve Martin and Martin Short is doing vaudeville and Dad-humour as only they know how and the various guest actors are fun to see.

I do not understand Selena Gomez however. She has a hard time with the acting and her face sadly doesn't emote at all. I get that Martin & Short found it fun and perhaps necessary to inject a current actress into the series in order to snare the younger viewers and I am sure Gomez is a nice person, but as an actress she has a lot to learn.

All and all this is an ok show mostly for people who remembers the ""good old days."""
2.0,4 September 2024,"My wife and I have tried watching this twice. The only reason I know that we have tried it twice is that we decided to start watching it due to all the adverts that were coming on, and rave reviews on Instagram. On 'firing it up', it turned out that we had already watched up to episode 7 of season 1, presumably when it first came out, but neither of us could recall a thing from it. On the second attempt, we realised why - it's a total mess. The storyline is jumbled, and there is a total lack of humour, so we just gave up. Maybe you need an American sense of humour - it reminded me a bit of the US copy of the Office, which isn't a patch on the original UK version. I gave it 2 stars because the set looks good."
1.0,11 February 2023,"Martin Short and Steve Martin are charismatic and easy to watch, but that seems to be all this show has going for it - and even this pair are dull apparently without good writing. Selena Gomez is wooden and only serves to lower the average age.

It feels like somebody threw together a list of names who are well-loved or fashionable, and were so confident that their personalities alone would carry the show that they didn't bother to get a writer. The show just drifts along sideways without generating any sizzle or laughs whatsoever. I don't think I've ever cared less about who did it

If I can say something positive about the show, it's the beautiful set design and the incredible open-mouthed nap I just had while it played in the background."
4.0,2 October 2021,"I really can't say, because after first episode it just went down. Actors play is very flat, and again there are main characters that are unlikable and annoying. I guess it is just another show aimed at twitter people."
3.0,3 October 2021,"It was somewhat funny at the beginning with the interplay of conversations between Steve Martin and Martin Short and its amusing premise. In fact I signed up for hulu specifically to watch it as it was well publicized, anticipating something really good and funny. The monotone gravely (or is it nasal voice) of Selena Gomez with her flat, expressionless face (was that supposed to be funny?) and her character to me add nothing to the series. I don't find her the least bit interesting or amusing. (I guess one should give her credit for at least having lips that moved.). I quite enjoyed the first week's episodes. They were somewhat amusing and Martin Short occasionally said something that made me laugh out loud, but by the second group of episodes it just got both really complicated and really boring at the same time. I think when the Selena Gomez's mother starts speaking and going on about her daughter..(won't give any further details of the 'plot' except to say it was in New Jersey or was it Long island?) ...it just got unbearably boring and lost me. Given that Only Murders in the Buildling seems to have gotten ""rave reviews"" from both critics and viewers to me it is actually a bit of an Emperor has no Clothes situation. I don't see it deserving 5 stars. It certainly is being well promoted, yet it seems highly over-rated. Perhaps this is occurring because audiences love the actors so much and are expecting great things from them, so they dub it 'great' and are in a sense blinded by their expectations. It's working really hard to be funny and clever...but for me really just petered out and became more like an amateur high school creative play writing attempt. My perception is that it went so downhill in terms of script and even the acting of the secondary characters to the point I stopped watching it all together. Compared to the recent series ""The White Lotus"", which was well written and very funny, this just seems disappointing."
5.0,17 September 2022,"I only watched the first two episodes and I did NOT fall in love with the series. I love Steve Martin and Martin Short, but this just doesn't grab me. Selena Gomez is a great actress, but even this doesn't do her justice.

The language is also a huge turn-off. I've heard so many F-bombs that it's not even funny.

Also--I know New York City is a great place to tour, but isn't it kinda overused? I keep thinking that Hollywood needs to explore other big, average, and small towns. I think you would find more material for future storylines if you didn't over use the giant cities like NYC. When you look outside the usual places, you can find unique personalities."
2.0,7 June 2022,"Three true crime podcast enthusiasts and tenants of the Arconia witness a murder in the building and take it upon themselves to solve the case, by of course producing their own serial like podcast, as they haphazardly search for clues. Created by John Hoffman (Grace and Frankie) and Steve Martin, and starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez, I honestly had much higher hopes for this series. It's fine, but I often get the sense that Martin was really trying to tiptoe the line between a real crime drama and a satirical comedy, but Martin Short continually pulls hard towards the comedy side while Selena Gomez basically plays straight drama. It creates friction from scene to scene, often not in the best ways, making the series swap tones ungracefully. I honestly thought Gomez had the best acting in this series, and I didn't really find any of it laugh out loud funny (maybe except whenever Tina Fey shows up), but also I've never really been a fan of true crime podcasts, which this show is of course heavily based on mocking. Wasn't bad, but wouldn't necessarily recommend."
2.0,16 September 2021,"I don't know what to call this ,i feel dumb for watching this how could anyone enjoy something this

I Honestly hate ly self for watching this

This show is just bad Poor plot strange acting i like a show where people say what they're supposed to say the dialogue is just poorly written."
2.0,2 September 2021,"Sometimes, I wonder what century I'm in.

Old male character's introspection: shown while he's walking into his flat.

Other old male character's introspection: shown while he's checking his computer.

Young female character's introspection: shown while she is having a shower? With a totally unnecessary glimpse of boob?

And yes, I love the rest of the show, but seriously: this should not be happening. Not in 2021."
3.0,9 October 2024,Splitting the trio up is perhaps the worst thing that happens as the season goes on. Gets completely away from the narrative of the actual mystery and essentially makes a spoof of the first season. Bringing in characters to play themselves doesn't make any sense because the thought they would have gotten big enough to have people play them after a podcast is far fetched. Picking characters to develop first requires them to be like able at first. Talking about people we never meet doesn't help. Seems like they are getting away from the main narrative just for an excuse to add well known characters to their cast list to drive viewership.
5.0,1 September 2021,"So flat, when in theory everybody's doing what's expected with voiceovers and perkiness and jokiness . . . But it's all . . . Really really flat.

So a no for me. Hope you like it more."
5.0,1 September 2021,"I always hate shows/movies produced by the streaming companies. This is Hulu's first show that I've ever wanted to watch. I'm only 2 episodes in. So far it's pretty interesting. Steve Martin Short are good, but Selena Gomez has been a drawback for sure. Maybe it's supposed to be her character, but it's almost like she doesn't even want to be there. How does she like 12 and like a grandma at the same time. I'm a couple of years older than her, but she's going to be older than me pretty soon. I have hopes for this show. I'm liking it so far, which, as I said before is the first time I've ever enjoyed a show produced by a streaming company."
3.0,3 September 2021,"You didn't laugh once. Admit it. You want to like it because you've liked these people in other things but this is bad, really bad. The monotony of the character points, the numerous mentions of ""podcast"" when it's clear the writers have never heard one. How do I know? When the power in the bldg goes out and the principles all lose ""transmission"" of their favorite podcast at the same time, the writers don't know a goddam thing about podcasts. That's not how anything works do some research... and jfc what is the deal with Selena's speaking voice? Isn't she voice trained? Sounds more like she's in need of a heimlich than a Grammy. Enunciate hon. It's the least you owe your silly fans. Great acting. Nice mom jeans I guess."
1.0,3 September 2021,"Love these actors was excited to watch it. I even saw a review that said clean and funny. I couldn't even get past the first 15 min. They had use expletives over and over so much so I turned it off. Where's all the good, clean, funny movies/shows gone?"
2.0,1 September 2021,It's silly and there is no chance Gomez melds with Martin or Short. No fault on any actors it's just not very good. It's a drag on with no suspense and just a hope for a moment of genius which occurs sparingly and fades into other blandness. Watching MASH reruns instead. I'll be back but will pass very soon.
4.0,11 September 2021,Can't they make a series or movie without all the F bombs and foul language. What a disappointment major detractor. Was looking forward to watching it but won't.
5.0,9 July 2023,"This show actually outdoes itself...i can't believe so many people hold it so high...i can't believe it's rated this high...and at the same time...i don't completely totally hate it...for some reason...

before i say too much...i would like to take this chance to beg selena gomez NEVER to take another acting role again her entire life...selena cannot act...she couldn't act if it was able to bring Justin Bieber back...she is terrible...she almost singlehandedly pulls this show under...

the comedy is horrendous...the acting is bad the story is bland...there's basically nothing here...Martin's character would have been the saving grace...but it's way over the top...it ends up being ridiculous and cheap...

this show commits one of writing's worst possible mistakes...it overexplains...it tells does very little showing...it even explains the comedy instead of being funny...wooow...even slapstick comedy is explained...they probably have a grade school student a writing gig for this one...

i want to say it can make for mindless watching...but it is too empty to even be enjoyed accidentally...Skip it..."
5.0,5 September 2023,
5.0,28 August 2024,"For hilarious antics of aged showbizzers, wath 'The Kominsky Method'. For baroque mysteries watch 'Lodge 49' (Season 1 only). For black humour, watch 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'. For murder mystery, stylish digitally-enhanced direction and deep characterization, watch 'The White Lotus'. You get the idea. Steve, Martin and Selena got their loose money together and decided to make a tribute to their favourite shows of the past ten years.

It didn't come off, but that didn't stop this vanity project getting a third season. I'll check it out to see if it improved - in fact, OMITB could hardly get worse. Selena Gomez not only can't act, she barely registers as an extra. Steve Martin is trying to rock his late seventies, but is still doing hids 'Father Of The Bride' shtick, which was very, very old then. And Martin Short? For someone supposed to be completely broke, he seems to do doing very well in the grooming department - completely unconvincing.

The problem? They've tried to shoehorn everything they can think of into the premise - there's no clear suspense, just inconsequential mystery after inconsequential mystery. And the jokes? There might as well be a canned laughter track, something like 'Green Acres', you know.

I came to OMITB from a Guardian review calling it the funniest thing on TV. That review must have been written during the queen's funeral."
5.0,28 August 2024,"But the acting? The writing? Not good at all.

None of the three leads are paragons of acting prowess. Sure, there are Martin fans. But Gomez? No thank you.

And Martin Short? If there is ever a lifetime putrid achievement award in the Razzies, he gets my vote. Any production he's been a part of sinks because of him. But Hollywood loves their mascots and that's what he is.

Emmys? That the show was nominated wasn't surprising. It checked a bunch of boxes. But that it actually won a couple? I'd say I was shocked, but the fact is it's all an insider's game. Fellow actors, fellow writers and directors vote. It's about popularity, messaging and representation.

I couldn't even get through the first season.

And let's not forget about the nonstop profanity.

Because, you know, that's the hallmark of good writing."
1.0,1 September 2021,"It was funny to watch but my expectations were so high for this, kinda disappointed. Selena looked beautiful all the time."
5.0,25 February 2023,"Talk about a terrible show, I cannot give this a negative star rating but wish I could. The acting is terrible! I am not sure what happened to Steve Martin but he is absolutely wooden in this. And Selena Gomez should stick to singing as she is NOT an actress.

The plot is so absurd that these three people would have access to all these off limits areas of their building in this age of cameras everywhere. Its just so absurd.

It was the roughest sit I have had in a very long time. I gave it 3 episodes to see what all the hullabaloo was about and then decided my time is worth vastly more than this!"
2.0,18 July 2024,"Sorry folks this is horrible. References to old stories, outdated clich√©s, and dreadful acting by otherwise talented actors makes for a very boring and cringe worthy and embarrassing effort. It's like the writers threw in every aspect of modern life and current social issues and tried to connect it with nostalgic situations and stories from the 20th century.

Steve Martin looks like a stick figure stuck in the middle of real characters and Martin Short is trying to save the day in each scene, and painfully overacting.

The story is dumb, predictable, and thin. It is sad to see such a waste of great talent. Perhaps they can save it with a grand banjo performance by Steve and some good old comedy from Martin."
2.0,18 January 2022,"After seeing so many high praise for this show, and also a fan of Steve Martin, l have high expectations for this show. But it's so boring and unfunny l don't know how you can calls this a comedy. All the main characters are so unlikable, especially that Martin Short, never liked him as an actor and he's extremely annoying here. Just because he's a friend of Martin doesn't mean he should be on the show!"
5.0,22 September 2021,"On 8/31/21, fifty-five reviews were submitted with scores of 10 stars. Maybe three had a score of 9. Maybe three-four had scores of less than 8 stars. All the reviews with scores of ten seem to be written in the same writing style with short punchy energetic headings.

As of today 9/21/21, 300 reviews have been submitted. So, 1/6 of the reviews to date were submitted up front. Does this indicate a contrived self-promotion? It does to me. Way way obvious. The series is just not that good. Selena is as flat as a pancake and cannot be propped up by Martin and Short."
3.0,7 September 2021,"The pilot is supposed to be their best shot. And this was it? Cringeworthy. Not funny. Not suspenseful. If you insist on watching, suggest you go to your local MJ dispensary and load up because you are going to need it in order to find this crap remotely entertaining."
2.0,9 September 2022,"The only good thing about this show is the intro. Who ever thought Selena Gomez would be a good cast? She can't act and ruins almost every scene. Her voice always has the same dull tone, showing no emotion at all. I have to give credit to Martin Short and Steve Martin, who did make this show somewhat watchable.

Some scenes that force politics also don't make it a better show. What was that with the Armenian genocide scene, a very touchy subject which was so out of place in one of the scenes of episode six. And I really did not care about the whole relationship problems of detective Williams' lesbian houshold.

These are just some examples why this series is a mess.."
3.0,18 September 2021,Set design was beautiful. I really liked the actors but turned off after 30mins - dialogue was below par and the weird swearing. No fanks.
2.0,19 October 2021,"I love cliche and cheesy shows/movies and seeing Selena was in this (a little bit of a fan üòÖ) I was so excited... But honestly, it was painful to watch.

I feel like the director would have been shaking their head in frustration almost every scene. Selena was incredibly monotonous, to the point that it felt like I was watching a school production. I thought maybe she would be better as the season went on... I was very wrong.

High hopes... But now I wish I didn't bother watching it."
3.0,18 September 2022,"Season 1 was a joy to watch but it looks like Steve Martin caved in to the woke mob for season 2. What was the point of throwing Selena Gomez into a lesbian love story other than to show, as Martin Short so nicely explained it, that bisexuality is a very progressive mindset nowadays? I waited until the entire series was over just to see if there was a point to it other than proving your woke street creds, and there wasn't. There was a love story in season 1 that actually added to the plot but this was nothing more than a bone tossed in to keep the baying woke hounds at bay. If the series needed filler there would have been far more interesting plot twists to pass the time. Steve, you let us down."
5.0,9 October 2021,I have skipped parts . Wasn't this supposed to be funny??I love Selena but her vibe is ...meh. Well the mystery is good also the only reason I am continuing this. But still overall a 5 because I mean it's not funny and all the emo stuff is not interesting / gripping /fun to wtach.
4.0,19 October 2021,"So much potential was wasted in this show. Two of my favorite comedians but they fell flat. I think with the writers cramming as much innuendo and cursing it just felt awkward hearing it come from Steve and Martin. They even looked uncomfortable with their lines most of the time.

The story was fun and I enjoyed it. What I didn't enjoy was the underlying message that I've seen with many actors and writers trying to come backand draw an audience, the feeling that there is a need to include things that just aren't really appropriate for the show or for television. You don't have to include sex or the discussion of such to be funny or move a plot. You don't have to throw in f-words to appeal to crowds or to appear fresh and popular.

If there is a second season, make it appropriate for as many ages as possible. Leave out the language, change the dialog and I guarantee that there will be a larger following and no one will even miss it."
5.0,25 August 2022,"The show is a little fun, sometimes too much, sometimes silly (the two last episodes for example).

I could be fine with all this, but Selena Gomez's acting, it is awful, horrible.

Just a statute reciting (literally), no emotion, stiff face.

Stay away from acting please, or go take a decade learning how to do so."
4.0,7 September 2021,The writers try too hard to be cute. I'd HATE to have dinner with these 3. Each is boring and when you combine them you get boring cubed. There is not enough difference in personalities between the 3 to create any interest. I like the idea of the show but the execution falls flat.
1.0,26 February 2022,"I realize I'm in the minority, but.this is not comedy. I barely smiled a couple of times. I don't know what they tried, and what their intentions were, but Martin fall short, and Selena was... Let's say she should go back to being a singer. I love the duo Steve Martin Short. But this was almost unwatchable, and not funny at all. No idea how it got such a high score everywhere."
3.0,14 August 2023,"I truly don't understand the reviews. I found it boring and after ep 3 I skiped directly to ep 10 from season 1. I just couldnt watch 7 episodes to find out what happend with that man killed in ep 1. I didnt find it funny nor brilliant, how many say. But is just my opinion. Needless to say I have no interest for the following seasons.

The character interpreted by Selena Gomez is like....sooo boring. I don't have another word to describe it.

First 2 ep from season 1 I watched fast forward just to not fall asleep during the movie.

I'm sorry because I like all the main 3 actors, but, that's it.."
3.0,18 December 2021,"Just so you know this isn't like the usual crime stories, it's more like high school detectives.

I laughed twice throughout the whole 1st season.

And it wasn't interesting either, as normally i would be engaged in piecing the clue together to find out who the killer was, but it just didn't invoke that within me.

Try watching Mindhunter, Clickbait, or Mare of Easttown and you will know what i meant."
4.0,20 November 2021,"Steve Martin and Martin Short were great. Them and Selena Gomez made a likeable unlikely team. The bits where she helps her two elderly friends navigate the modern world were funny and touching, likewise for the bits where the two men try to be protective and caring of her despite not quite understanding why millenials act the way they do. Martin and Short are funny and charming and Tina Fey was great in a cameo.

But the weaknesses outweigh the strengths. The story feels like it was written by first time writers -- it has a very sophomoric feel to it. It is boring and weak. This is a mystery story but that plot is kept more or less in halt till the very end -- the middle episodes are full of extraneous and frankly boring backstories and subplots. Selena Gomez's acting was another weak point of the series.

The story needed to focus on the mystery, it needed some colorful suspects, some suspense and a lot more fun scenes of the three leads investigating together. Instead we get a lot of cliched, done-to-death subplots involving each character. There were glimpses of a hella fun show, but it got buried by the bad writing."
5.0,7 November 2021,"The show started out good - entertaining, funny, suspenseful - but then it started getting a bit odd and even boring, which is too bad because I'm not sure now that I'll finish it."
1.0,6 December 2021,"I loved watching the series, but until the last moment.. There is a scene in the series about the Turks committing genocide. Did you seriously make a scene like this without shame? Why don't you do proper research? Shout out to you, screenwriter... so shame."
4.0,9 September 2024,"Perhaps I came into this show with the wrong idea but I'm half way through the first season and I just can't get into it.

You can tell that it is artfully and expensively made, with high production values, the odd moment of visual fantasy, and a big name cast.

But I thought it would be fun. It's not. And that is a bit of a problem when you have Steve Martin and Martin Short in the cast.

There is the odd moment of wit and humour but it is spread pretty thinly. The tempo overall is slow - almost tragic. And I don't mean because of the ""Murders in the Building"" - I mean because of the protagonists own lives.

Another issue for me is Selena Gomez's performance. She is really lifeless and distracted and has this flat tone of voice that kills every scene she is in. I don't know what she was aiming for, but she doesn't hit the mark at all.

OMITB ticks the boxes as a murder mystery show but the casting of Martin and Short is wasted."
2.0,19 August 2022,"I'm genuinely so confused by all the positive reviews. This show falls so flat in every single way, the acting is so unbelievable, the three main actors quarter ass their performances. The only one who was delivering was nathan lane, and he's barely in the show. The plot lines are so hollow and lacking in any suspense or drama, or even logic. I really wanted to like this, cause i, like everyone else in the world love steve martin and martin short. But this just wasn't it. A truly horrible show that looks beautiful."
1.0,14 September 2021,"Are we back to the era of silent movies?

How does this help?

Over the last 10 or something years there is a degradation, decline, horrible decline in the quality of movie making. It's in every aspect of it: mediocre scripts, bad acting, bad editing.

Period."
1.0,3 October 2023,"A nice show overall, Martin and Short are entertaining, plot is ok.. ...but Selena Gomez is absolutely awful.

Unfortunately, her acting is bad and very slow, she is hard to understand when she talks, she has a boring monotone voice, and she is not attractive. Like a robot without any emotions in a thick cotton sweater, and no sense of humour.

I wonder why they picked her? There are thousands of actresses out there, who would be a much better fit, and would have improved the show massively. But Selena probably bought her way into this show...

Maybe there will be another murder in the building in season 4, and we'll get a new female lead... or her sister arrives and takes over.. or she has a new girlfriend and vanishes for the season.. there is still hope..."
5.0,8 October 2021,"I really like Steve Martin and Martin Short but I stopped watching after a few episodes. I think the writers/producers are so focused on being politically correct that they forgot to make a good show. At the end of the day this could have and should have been entertaining but it fails at that.

Don't believe all the exclamation points!!!!!!!!!

They're just there to trick you."
1.0,26 September 2021,"If your not a fan of Steve Martin, Martin Short, or Selena Gomez, I honestly don't know why you would want to watch this. I watched five episodes, and got more and more bored. Tired old guys try and fail to make funny and/or intelligent observations about younger persons and/or society. Totally uninteresting characters, there's really no reason why I would want to know more about them. Quite a lot of embarrassing and/or pointless scenes that doesn't add anything, like the ""suspects audition"". Poor and really slow handling of the plot; e.g., what could have been interesting suspect twists are discarded after about two minutes with ""oh, he/she admitted to be lying, alright then, no longer a suspect"". Maybe drop some clues here and there, e.g., in flashbacks, that may make the viewer think and draw his/her own conclusions? No. A lot of cameos, unfortunately quite pointless, I can't think of anyone who actually added something more than the physical presence.

The most fun I had was counting the number of times I thought ""was this supposed to be funny?"".

But of course, if all that sounds appealing to you, then you're in for a treat."
2.0,15 January 2022,"Let's be honest, trying too hard to be funny always flops, The two old guys were well written, the girl was meh-bel.

I'm familiar with Selena's acting so it was no surprise that it was mild and underwhelming. I had guessed all the plot twists maybe 3 episodes in.

Kinda insufferable.

Those people that like watching romance kdramas will probably enjoy this, because it is a very feel good show.

And now, who wants a feel good, thriller? We want a mind**** thriller."
3.0,21 September 2021,The only people with talent on this show are Martin Short and Steve Martin.
3.0,2 August 2022,"If not a Manhattan-phile, avoid this. The cast sounded intriguing. The plot sounded cringe. Cringe won. It turns out Gomez cannot act at all, and Martin panders to whatever cringey wokeism he thinks will keep him semi-relevant. The result = CRINGE! I lived in Manhattan. This is a bow to Manhattan by Martin. Having lived there, that ends up being the only temporarily watchable aspect. But, having lived in Manhattan, I can never understand why anybody wants to watch stories about NYers. Just miserable. If Woody Allen made his worst effort ever (and he made some bad ones), he'd put out something like this."
1.0,14 September 2021,"Lots of predictable dialog, with characters that are too unrealistic to relate to. A few good laughs. Unrealistic situations. Maybe it's a matter of the creators and actors not being settled on whether it's supposed to be a comedy, a mystery, a crime show, or a drama."
1.0,23 July 2022,"Selena Gomez is boring and pedestrian and Martin Short is way over the top and annoying as hell, to the point of distraction. Short's character is stupid and unlikeable. Everything he says and does is so wrong and ridiculous that it actually isn't funny. There is no reason to believe the other two would have anything to do with him. After 3 episodes I'm seriously considering giving up on it."
3.0,31 January 2024,"Did you ever experience paying a King's ransom to watch a live theatre performance only to eventually and disappointingly walk out of the theatre saying WTF? Well maybe the $9.95 per month Disney charges to watch Only Murders in the Building isn't a King's ransom, but I do value the 30 plus hours Mrs. Shullivan and I invested in watching the first three seasons and yes, we were disappointed.

I have always enjoyed both Steve Martin and Martin Short's physical comedy but their banter back and forth each and every episode with their moderator and third amigo Selena Gomez who plays Mabel Mora, the interior designer and artist, was nothing more than boring banter. Steve Martin plays. Charles-Haden Savage an unemployed TV star from a long forgotten crime series as the 1990's TV Detective Brazzos. Martin Short plays the most unluckiest stage director Oliver Putnam, and unlike having the Midas touch it seems any play Oliver creates falls flatter than actress Cara Delevingne's chest.

Mrs. Shullivan and myself watched the first couple of episodes and we realize that you have to invest some time in the first few episodes of any new TV series before you can actually assess whether or not, a TV series is both entertaining and intriguing. Unfortunately we continued watching each and every episode of the first three (3) seasons and the banter between the three (3) actors just continued to get more meaningless as did the storylines.

There are quite a few cameo appearances by first rate film and/or stage actors such as Nathan Lane, Amy Ryan, Paul Rudd, Tina Fey, Michael Rapaport, and even Meryl Streep, but even with all that talent and the mantra ""the show must go on"" , I asked Mrs. Shullivan ""how much more of this boring series do you want to endure?""

The series has a considerable amount of time on the actual stage of New York City's iconic 3,400-seat United Palace Theater which is another failed attempt of trying to convince us the audience we are watching a live stage performance for only $9.95 a month, rather than the average $400 ticket price for a front row Broadway experience. Actress Noma Dumezweni plays stage critic Maxine Spear and if her opinion counts, she's not a fan of stage director Oliver Putnam's plays, and unfortunately neither are Mrs. Shullivan and I.

But as the late great P. T. Barnum always said ""There's a sucker born every minute"" Welcome to the club.

I give this TV series a passable 5 out of 10 IMDb rating and I would really like a refund from the Disney channel."
4.0,6 September 2021,"I watched one episode. I can't believe the likes of Martin and Short would pair themselves with a singer that can't act. Besides her nasally voice, it's hard to watch her trying to act. No thanks."
3.0,26 August 2024,"Why?!! Why does every new series have to be ""TV-MA""?! Don't you writers have vocabulary that contains words with more than 4 letters? Stop it already. It's ignorant and immature and lacks creativity. I watched Fred MacMurray in ""Murder, He Says"" last night. Screwball comedy, funny, clean, entertaining. I have watched Steve Martin and Martin Short make clean funny movies for years. Parenthood, Father of the Bride, Three Amigos, Mars Attacks!. Those were good movies. C'mon man! Give us something decent to watch. Do you talk your mother like they talk in this series? I mean I can handle a word or two here or there. I don't live under a rock. But when people talk like potty mouthed teenagers I call them out on it. I was looking forward to something new and creative. So tired of this. Grow up, will you!"
2.0,5 September 2021,"There may be a good 2-hour movie in this but it's stretched out over 10 episodes. It makes fun of true crime shows drawing out the drama, and yet it does the same thing. It's always fun to see Steve Martin and Martin Short, and they do pretty good riffing off of their charisma. But Chrissy Metz is just a bland, robotic third wheel here. And somehow, as beautifully produced as it is, the whole thing feels lifeless. And I'm not prude but what's up with the abrupt vulgarity, like the F bombs and the Long Island cousin finger thing. It's like some Hollywood producer's note that ""New Yorkers are really vulgar. Make sure to get that in."""
4.0,20 September 2022,"I can't, for the life of me, understanding the extreme adoration for this show. The pacing is lethargic and inconsistent. The supporting characters, with only a few small exceptions, are painfully unlikable. The few likeable supporting characters are shoved to the sidelines. Selena Gomez is an awful, expressionless actress with the charm and charisma of a mossy log. Martin Short is great, and Steve Martin is solid, though it just makes me want to watch better material from them. The plot twists are half telegraphed to the point of self parody and half nonsensical to the point of absurdity. The one legitimately great thing about the show is the score. I think if you're from New York City, this show is probably funnier (since it's riddled with winking in-jokes about the city) but even then the humor is one note. There are countless better mysteries, comedies, and Steve Martin/Martin Short content out there. Don't waste your time."
2.0,19 January 2022,"I expected to love this and although I like Martin Short and Steve Martin in this, I really don't Selena Gomez in this. I loved her in Wizards of Waverly Place and expected her to be great in this. She isn't good at all and I really don't understand the glowing reviews. She brings the show down for me. She is completely wooden, like Kristen Stewart wooden...except on an antidepressant or something. She is entirely unfeeling and shows no emotion whatsoever, almost robotic. She speaks in a monotone voice and her face is fairly expressionless. Is there a chance that her character turns out to be a cold murderer...sure maybe, I'd have to continue watching to find out. Is she intentionally acting this way because that's what will happen? I don't know, but she's pretty awful in this and should try to make her character less guilty seeming perhaps. I expected to love her in this and now I don't see myself watching anything she's in."
1.0,3 September 2021,"I happened upon this show accidentally, and when I saw all of the 10-star reviews, I thought I happened upon a masterpiece. The first episode was good, but it still had me on the fence. That one scene where things happen in reverse put me off and made me rethink my expectations of the show, and the second episode quickly ruined it altogether. It isn't funny to me, and the dialogue and character dynamics come out as awkward... I see too much of the actors in their characters and lines (and the delivery of them). The little amount of originality within them that's left is boring.

I might continue casually watching it.. If my current opinion changes, I'll make an edit. If not, I'd recommend sitting out on this one."
1.0,24 September 2021,"It includes a conversation whis is incorrect and has false information in it about turks commiting genocide. They even write greeks in there which is a never case in history.

It is obvious They did not use any historian to consult about this. It seems that they write the scene just by their opinion which they lack so much about it."
3.0,16 February 2024,"I seriously think AI bots must be giving this lousy series high ratings and glowing reviews. Hard to believe sentient beings could feel that way about this steaming pile.

The premise is good, but that's it. The casting is a joke. Only Steve Martin has some redeeming qualities along with some of the extra characters, but the main cast is mainly awful esp Selena Gomez and Martin Short who go together like oil and water. Selena may have talents, but acting is not one of them. And Martin Short, not sure if he was ever funny, but he's not now I can assure you. The rest of the show is mainly used to develop its Hollywood diversity bona fides."
1.0,24 November 2021,"This one started well and expectancy levels were high considering the names involved. But it goes downhill after episode 3. A total let down in terms of script.

And the pretext for the murder was rather lame, so with the ending. Perhaps preparing for S02.

Selena Gomez has the same stoic stare and monotonous voice throughout.

The old men are tolerable, though not the dialogues. I actually fast forwarded many of the episodes, hoping for some thing sane somewhere. There was none."
3.0,6 November 2023,"I have seen this show on my Hulu constantly. As it has Steve Martin and Martin Short I was doubtful. When I saw it received high marks I decided to watch. What I got was exactly what I expected, unfortunately. Both actors trying to act funny when neither of them are funny. Martin is funny when he plays the straight guy, Short just tries way to hard. Insert Selena Gomez. She is good enough, but they make her swear just for the effect of seeing her swear. Conversation twists? Old people, young people? Old people dont know the current lingo? And the deaf episode? I can only imagine how everyone was patting themselves on the back for that episode. Self important, lazy, and simple. A waste of time."
4.0,4 September 2021,
3.0,10 September 2021,I can't figure it out! I love Steve Martin and Martin Short (I don't know Selena Gomez - sorry) I should love this show - but it is uninteresting - I don't care who Tim Kono is and I couldn't care less why he died....
5.0,13 October 2023,"We have been fans of the show since day one! The interaction between Martin Short and Steve Martin is phenomenal. I wasn't sure about Selena, but they are match made for that building.

The amount of profanity in Season 3 deterred my husband from watching it at all. I did watch the entire season and enjoyed the story line, but it was painful due to the language.

It is so terribly sad the writers felt the need for all of the foul language, when IT IS SOOOOO UNCESSARY!!!

Maybe next season ""Only Murders in the Building"". As for now, I have to tell my teenagers they will miss this season. Again, it is so completely unnecessary and we feel good about our review because we are not the only ones that were extremely disappointed in the profanity used throughout the ENTIRE season :-("
3.0,4 February 2024,"The first episode is promising, but it gets more and more monotonous with old jokes and scenes. I love Steve Martin, but Selena Gomez and Martin Short are totally the wrong actors for this series, Steve has that subtle black humor (when he wants to) and maybe a better counterpart would be Hugh Laurie instead of the slightly boring Martin Short who can't even make the necessary grimace to raised the mood of the scene. Selena seems disinterested and her acting shows how bored she is, and probably only the generous fee contributed to her so-called role in this nonsense of a series that should be like a comedy. In my opinion, it would be better to hire a new actress instead of catering to the younger audience (generation z or whatever those tik tok lumens are called) with Selena Gomez.

I love comedies but this is well thought out but disastrously written with disastrous actors who can't wait to get back to their trailers.

Instead of dying of laughter we just got that ""ha ha"" moment when something funny comes up.

I understand that a black woman was needed as balance but at least you could have thrown in Whoopi or Retta instead of the disinterested Selena.

In series like this, the actor's facial expression is also very important, but apart from Steve, who tries something, everyone else is sterile.

For someone who literally grew up watching comedies, this is barely two stars."
1.0,28 October 2021,"I was done after E1 but watched through E4. Gratuitous use of the F word was the first thing to turn me off and certainly adds nothing to the viewing experience. Steve Martin is usually funny and enjoyable to watch. Not so in Only Murders in the Building. Martin Short is not funny nor enjoyable to me and he continues his completely blah and forgettable acting in this production. Selena Gomez is okay. Big name actors all muted by the poor dialog, story line and directing.

After four episodes and there is nothing that keeps me interested in watching the next episode. The plot, murder in the main character's apartment building, is lost behind extraneous the yawn fest of each episode. No character, including the murder victim, draws me in to caring for them nor understanding about them. Everyone is completely forgettable and uninteresting.

Once again an 'Original' series which is just left behind and forgotten."
1.0,1 September 2021,"I love Steve Martin. Light hearted comedy. Why the need for F-bombs? Seriously!?

Tired of all streaming services creating TV-MA shows due to profanity."
1.0,18 October 2021,"In season 1 episode 2, the alleged genocide of the greeks/armenians is brutally discussed. The topic is absolutely indifferent for this series. Nevertheless, it is talked about in the most disgusting way for 10 minutes. A clear political statement. After this episode, i stopped watching the series."
5.0,26 September 2021,"I loved watching the series, but until the last moment.. There is a scene in the series about the Turks committing genocide. Did you seriously make a scene like this without shame? Why don't you do proper research? Shout out to you, screenwriter... Build your history."
5.0,19 December 2023,"I always enjoyed Steve Martin, even the movie was not good. Just love it. He always felt like i can spend 2 hours or so of my time in a easygoing fashion.

So when i saw this series i thought it should be fun. Right? Wrong. It was a total crap. The story, the dialogue the scene everything and everyone was so painful that if it was possible I'd have asked to murder themselves.

What really amazed me is that people voted so it gathered imdb rating of 8. Whoch really tricked me.

And yes, selena and the other tool , never was excited about them.

Steve made me watch it.

Next time stick with movies and funny. Dont go for crime and serious stuff."

4.0,31 August 2021,"The main issue i had was with selena gomez, her acting is rubbish i couldn't get passed it. The story is a bit messy and rushed but a good idea."

3.0,21 September 2021,"Selena is really annoying ... boring brings nothing ... monotone much? I can't take it .. I'm trying to ""rewatch it"" to see if it was just my mood .. Selena Gomez has to be the most boring,monotone,brings nothing to this, actor I can recall ever .. if they replace her in the next season ... I will do backflips .. I think it will save it .. Selena brings nothing. Actually Selena ruins each scene she's in ... she needs voice lessons .... Voice coach please ! I want to love this but Selena brings nothing to the table makes her character one dimensional... if that I'm so sorry for her little fans here .. but shes bad ! I just watched To protect and serve ... I can't take it .. I want to slap her and ask her to move her face or eyes or make anything coming out of her mouth not monotone and just dead line delivery if even delivered."
3.0,18 January 2024,"Awful, annoying, entitled 2-dimensional characters. No idea why anyone would waste their life watching this. The 2 stars are for the beautifully shot and lit lavish production values. There are so many genuinely interesting ideas and writers out there. Instead someone chose this creatively bankrupt nonsense. It feels like a 1950s Ealing Comedy with a handful of present day allusions added by a freshman with a laptop and way too much privilege.

Martin Short had the beginnings of a resurgent career in the Morning Show so sad to see him go back to low-grade daytime movie nonsense.

Disney needs to be braver than this. Dross like this literally has me reaching for the delete subscription button. Netflix isn't perfect but it at least has quality control."
2.0,26 September 2021,There is a cut in the series about the Turks committing genocide. Are you serious? Screenwriter are you okay? Don't you have a history? Look at what you did just to discredit the Turks. Go study some history bro. You are funny.
3.0,31 August 2021,This critically acclaimed only murders in the building is one of the worst comedy crime TV shows I've ever seen. You have really terrible acting with way too much over the top stuff it just doesn't come natural it's aggravating more than anything I tried really hard to watch that after the two seasons or I should say two episodes I'm really hoping there are no more seasons of this god awful show.
4.0,16 September 2021,"I love murder mysteries. I love Steve Martin. This series, however, is so full of foul language that I can't even enjoy it. Is there some reason every sentence has to be potty-mouth? There are also some ""adult"" scenes in this series that I could have done without..."
4.0,27 September 2021,"This is a 3rd class.mystery-comedy serial. Costumes and ambiance are very poor. It can be said that they spend all budged to pay actors. Unfortunately Teddy Coluca's worst performance ever. Besides everything, scenario doesnt increase your curiosity and you cannot get involved by the story. They tried to catch the audience by giving wrong political messages. It is a very poor move. Even if you read 1 book about WW1 in your life, you can laugh their incorrect message. So, my advice is dont watch this ""serial""."
2.0,30 September 2021,They drag you through episode after slow episode and then in the 7th episode they convert to those that have to read subtitles and I suppose in respect for those that are deaf. There are 3.5% of Americans who are deaft but Martin and Short think 94.4% should have to deal with it by watching subtitles. JUNK......I turned if off. It was boring anyway.
1.0,29 November 2021,"Judging just from the first episode, Selena Gomez character on the series is so stiff, like a face injected with botox, no reactions, she was just reading lines like on rehearsal with poker face, her acting so bad like she was forced to be with them, and her voice hardned like 70 years old lady, boring, of course i stoped watching at episode one."
3.0,28 September 2021,"Less than OK , only positive point show is clean ."
2.0,27 September 2021,"Martin Short and Steve Martin are excellent, as they are in just about everything they do. The storyline has great potential and the supporting cast are fantastic.

My only poblem is that Selena Gomez's character is exceedingly annoying. She is somber and judgmental. She also seems to have a problem with white men, which to me makes her a racist. Hopefully her chracter will develop into a nicer person, making the show more watchable."
1.0,23 August 2022,I started Season 2 after deciding I didn't lose all interest. This was a Killer of any interest I mustered up. Not only has the dialog and atmosphere become Maniacal not in a fun way. To top it off they hired Michael Rappaport. I cannot tolerate his rantings in real life or pretending to be acting. I'm done.
5.0,12 October 2023,This seems like a really funny show but one f word in the first five minutes sent me to the parent guide and I decided not to start watching the rest how on Earth this is rated a 13 I will never know please please can we have some kind of technology that automatically filtered out profanity. Incidentally I despair that it is considered adult to have swearing. Really in my opinion it should go the other way. The more swearing in a program the less mature it is. If you cannot communicate without using bad language go back to school. There enough words in the English language to convey anger frustration annoyance. ....ah I've reached my character limit.
4.0,24 August 2022,Replace Aaron and Selena who make you gringe every scene they are in and you have a hit. Please Hollywood if you are going to keep up with this disgusting woke agenda then at least find good actors.
3.0,6 July 2022,"This program is where old has been actors go.

I couldn't watch more than 20 minutes, so boring.

Not funny i laugh more when i fart!

These old folks are getting paid for this trash, good for them."
4.0,12 April 2022,"After seeing it, wondered why these actors didn't share a cast before, in a similar genre. Steve Martin and Martin Short together, in an understated, elegant detective comedy (well, more like comedic) series, with accents of good old times. Times that apparently did not exist before, since they never shared a similar cast... But the feeing that this is so spot on, that it must have existed before does not go away.

The setting is good, the story captivating, the atmosphere great. Escapist series, with people living a sheltered life, although they make sacrifices for it. And they embelish reality, because they arecartistical personalities. This is worth watching and hopefully will keep the same tone for the following seasons. It manages to be beautiful in various ways.

And it is more than just a detective (impromptu detectives) story. Tje building also has a role, the city too."
1.0,21 February 2023,"Selena Gomez's acting confuses me here. Some times she gets it right, and some times, it's like she doesn't know how she wants to convey herself. Is she a secret villain or someone that just doesn't have energy? In the first season, she was called ""shifty"" by Martin Short's character. He's incredibly right. Mable Mora is as confusing as it gets. Not mysteriously enticing.

The whole idea of one young girl being besties with two old dudes is cute, but after a while, it makes you think if it's realistic enough for these old men to have THAT much energy to be running around with so much murder and drama.

Speaking of, the first season ended in a dramatic way. And you mean to tell me someone wants to leave another dead body so early on in the season 2 to kick start the plot? It's too rushed! Too inconsistent! Too unreal.

Plus points though, I love their fashion and the interior is beautiful. It gave off the expensive vibes Gossip Girl reboot wished it could convey."
5.0,6 June 2022,"Five episode in, and the show's kind of a let down.

The story feels like it has too many extraneous tangents - feels like writers need to fill ten episodes.

Selena's acting is flat.

Martin Short's energy- true to form - carries any scene he's in.

And where's the ineffable artistry of our beloved Steve Martin? Certainly in the writing. But on screen time? Meah."
4.0,17 September 2021,"Naw, we got through 3 before we got tired of surfing the internet on our phone and decided to find something good to watch."
3.0,25 October 2021,"Slow to start, with a general 40 year old comedic preference throughout. An ok show TBH. The younger cast keeps it going. Would be good if not for the racial slurs against Irish people by the older cohort, why is it still acceptable to do that? Irish flu! In E10? And in E8: Rainbow crafted by a drunken leprechaun is ok because he's 3/4 Irish with a drinking problem? Although I probably answered my own question with it's 40 year old comedic preference."
4.0,31 August 2021,"Everything about this screams too much money, too many 'yes men' and not enough talent or self awareness. A lot has been spent on costumes and sets (and they look great) and cast (they look good, but apart from Martin Short, aren't bothering to act) whilst it appears no time or thought has gone into the story, script or editing. Additionally there's the occasional bit of light disablism, racism, poor bashing and ageism dropped in, apparently for 'laughs' as a counterpoint to the extreme privilege of the whole setting, but its really jarring and unnecessary."
5.0,14 March 2024,"I made it through the first 5 episodes and thought it was pretty good, but slow moving. Episode 6 killed it for me. First, after an opening commercial, they spent nearly 10 minutes showing the same scenes they showed in the earlier episodes. Why? Obviously they were just stretching it out, because everyone had already seen them. Then more commercials that were too dumb to watch.

Then they spend several minutes with a policewoman and her roomie talking - not moving the story ahead at all. Then more blather from a supposed ""super blogger"" that also did nothing to add to the story.

Episode 6 was over 30 minutes, but only included less than 10 minutes of anything that advanced the story from the end of episode 5.

It felt like something interesting was going to happen, but I was too bored to wait through 4 more hours to get to it.

Too much spam. I don't even care how it eventually ended."
5.0,21 August 2022,"Let's see---a murder mystery that takes place in an ultra-wealthy, Dakota-like apartment building in New York, where the residents are folksier and quirkier than Mayberry, and where the three main characters can traipse through a supposed murder scene more casually than Columbo. Everything about this series is contrived and unbelievable, especially the fact that the leads all live effortlessly in apartments worth millions of dollars, while Martin Short's character claims to be dead broke. Huh?

Steve Martin is indeed talented, but he is now approaching George Burns territory. Martin Short, who has has made a career out of being exaggerated and silly, is excruciating here, mugging more than ever while attempting to be riotously funny. He isn't.

Also, someone needs to tell the script-writers that the gratuitous use of modern obscenities---including the ever-present F, MF, S, and BS words---doesn't make the older characters more hip and contemporary, but rather it makes them more painfully contrived and emphasizes the lack of meaningful dialogue."
5.0,15 January 2023,"Off the bat, Steve Martin and Martin Short are as close to a guaranteed hit as you can come. Sadly, this attempt just doesn't quite make the bar. In fact, is misses pretty badly. The first couple episodes were cute, lively, and fun. It really felt like the characters were going to develop, but they just stay stuck in themselves episode after episode. After Ep 5, I had to pull the plug. As is the case with so many stories that take place in New York, the characters are anxious, mealy-mouthed, loud, and overly loquacious. We already did that shtick to death in the 70's with Woody Allen, so why are we revisiting that shtick now? Martin and Short need to reduce their spoken lines by about 50% and their characters would improve markedly. That Mrs. Maesel show suffers from this very same problem...way too many spoken lines to the point of boredom. A person just gets tired of listening after a while. I can see how New Yorkers will like this show, but out here in the west, the anxieties of New Yorkers just don't play well. We wonder why they can't get over themselves.

Oh, and all the comments about Selena Gomez being stiff, monotone, uninspired, bored, and rude are actually correct and true. She's just not an actress, but she is eye candy to young men, we're told.

The liberal use of profanity is fun and gives the show a certain authentic New York feel, but the characters are too stilted and unrealistic to actually connect with."
1.0,16 October 2022,"Someone dies in a building complex and 3 strangers who are die hard fan of murder mystery podcasts get together to solve the mystery. It is an OTT knockoff of Desperate Housewives. Instead of a neighborhood street, here it is a building. Instead of 4 families, here there are 3 strangers. Except quirky humor there is nothing much happening. You lose the interest to know who done it half way through because none of the suspects are interesting enough. Also why done it is really banal and cheap. Also there are lots of expensive jewelry lying around that no one care about. Plenty of plot holes , easy access to the evidences is really funny too. Don't believe in the high rating if you are a mystery fan."
5.0,1 November 2021,"I am not sure what I had expected of this series, but I quit watching after some few episodes.

Martin Short, better said his alter ego just can't stop running with his mouth, going on machine gun speed, the girl played by Selena Gomez is neutral for me, at least she is an eyecatcher, and Steve Martin (Brazzo) tries his best to rescue the whole thing called, lets say ""crime comedy"".

For me both criterias fail.

It is in a way funny, but not funny enough even though everybody tries hard to be funny and chaotic, (in my opinion they try way too hard, and you can feel it!), and it is in a way interesting, but not interesting or thrilling enough to keep me watching.

The story and setting for sure have potential... As said before, I have expected more."
5.0,17 April 2022,
4.0,31 August 2022,"Life is too short to have to put up with so much profanity, and no one and nothing in this show is funny. At least no one or nothing was in the first episode, which was as far as I got. I mean absolutely nothing was funny. Maybe it's some special secret type of humor only those in the know appreciate. I would have given it more of a chance, though, if not for the profanity. All I was left thinking at the end of Episode 1 was it's too bad the three characters didn't have a true comedy obsession instead of a true crime obsession.

(I'm so disappointed in Hulu, too. Every time I subscribe to watch something only Hulu has, I end up regretting the subscription. Their exclusive streaming shows aren't even worth $13 a month.)"
3.0,22 September 2021,
3.0,2 November 2023,"I find all the characters annoying and largely unbelievable. Maybe theater lovers see something I don't? The writing feels pretentious and so desperate to be funny that it just becomes awkward.

Selena Gomez doesn't feel natural and is more suited for music than film. Can't fault her for taking this opportunity, though.

Also, I never realized how annoying Martin Short's voice can be.

If I had to pick a favorite it would be Steve Martin. He gets 1 star, and the theme song is catchy so 1 for it.

Overall, everything put together feels like a waste of time and like all of these amazing resources would've been better spent elsewhere."
1.0,24 August 2022,"Steve Martin hasn't been funny for at least a decade, maybe two. Martin Short was never funny. He was like a Jerry Lewis, he needs a Dean Martin to make him funny. The chick? I've no idea where or why they dug her up.

The parade of old friends from other productions who were moderately funny a few decades ago is just sad. I don't get the attraction."
4.0,24 September 2021,This show is average at best. Gaping holes in the plot everywhere. It IS nice to see Steve Martin again. The plot line is of made for tv quality and it pales in comparison to the best out there on Disney/Nflix/Prime. What bothers me most is the nonsensical use of F-bombs. This would normally be a PG show and would be okay for the kids if it wasn't for Selena Gomez swearing all of the time. I honestly don't get it. I guess I truly don't understand their intended audience but I guess they don't either. Tune in now to watch Selena Gomez say the f-bomb every episode for no valid reason.
5.0,22 September 2021,If not for Steve Martin and Martin Short this would nearly be unwatchable. All of the other main characters are simply drab and uninteresting. Very little intrigue to keep the story moving.
3.0,18 September 2024,"I understand that she can bring audience to watch the series but she has a single expression for all emotions and expressions and a dead fish voice . She just spoilt and wasted a great lead character bu acting in it . That role could have been acted by a well deserving actor who had spent years learning acting .

She should stick to producing the show and leave teh acting part toa ctors .

Numerous times i felt a irritation whenever Selena Gomez came on screen with her voice and expressions .

These people should know what is their strength and stick to doing only that part of the show business and leave the actual creative process to experts ."
3.0,9 September 2021,"TV moved on, this series did not! Charming is the best I can say about this!"
5.0,5 December 2021,Disappointed. Was not able to get through the first episode due to the language. There is so much offensive language it was hard to follow the story line.
3.0,19 September 2021,What's up with the 10's? The 9's? The 8's? Is there a different version of this series that the highly paid critics watched? I expected better from Steve Martin. Was Selena forced on him? She. Has. No. Energy. Steve and Martin Short are dragging around a flat tire. What a waste of an idea. True crime podcasts are huge right now. There are conventions. There are Reddit groups. There are hard core fans. A little research please! The power going out does not shut off your iPhone! You can still listen to podcasts!
3.0,31 December 2021,"... it's not entirely her fault. It's clear she was badly miscast, presumably to help fulfill some ethnic-diversity requirement, and she sounds as if she was poorly dubbed. Her lifeless, beady-eyed expression never changes.

The two male leads are considerably more fun to watch. But Martin Short's aging-showbiz-loser character -- animated, garrulous, bubbly, and soft -- comes off as gay (that's what he would be in real life), so it's weird to see him visiting his adult son, and even weirder that the son is another example of nonwhite casting. Implausible.

Steve Martin's character makes more sense, but he's also the series' creator, and so it's probably his fault that, from the start, the story tends to drag. Even, for example, in the first episode -- an episode that really ought to hook us -- the camera lingers on him as he delivers a tedious, uninterrupted monologue about his past; Gomez is given one too, equally tedious; and... Well, put it this way: When Larry David, in the latest season of his own series, gets bored and impatient with what someone is saying, he begins humming the music that's played at the Academy Awards when an Oscar recipient's speech drones on too long. He even whips out his cell phone and plays it on that. All too often I had the same reaction, hearing Gomez and Martin.

I genuinely wanted to like this series (partly since it was filmed in my neighborhood), but as with other disappointed viewers on this site, I feel as if my time has been wasted."
5.0,25 August 2022,A real snoozer no matter what time you watch it. Long drawn out stories with well known cast members that slowly move the storyline along at a snail pace.
2.0,30 September 2021,"We watch a lot of murder mystery series so were attracted to Only Murders in the Building. The attraction was mostly due to the three lead actors. We've always liked Steve Martin and Martin Short. It is great to see Selena Gomez in a series role too and she is doing a fine job.

The story line is quite different, quirky which we like. The comedy is fun but not overwhelming.

Based on all I've written we would stay with the show except for one thing. The director must live in a different existence than we do. The swearing interrupts the flow for us and is completely unnecessary. It could be simply cut out of the script with no loss whatsoever."
2.0,20 October 2021,"Couldn't take any more of her monotone delivery.

But the other two? Very well done!

Keep going if you're losing interest or torn between this and so many other choices. It's a fun ride.

Whoa!!! Spoke too soon! Actually submitted my review before there was a hint of a season 2.

Not a fan of a season 2 here.

Actually Season 2 stinks."
4.0,22 September 2021,"Look, I'm totally fine with bad language IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT! I'm all in for a Tarantino movie or Eddy Murphy Raw or anything like that. In this, it seems way out of place and it's jarring. Lost interest after the first few minutes of episode 6. Also Selena Gomez is so blah. There is so much potential here but it's wasted on her and the poor attempt to make 2 classic comedians relevant by bad writing."
3.0,14 September 2021,"Finally! Martin Short is back, and he's back together with Steve Martin. The magic duo from the 80's :-)

They have always had a great chemistry and that hasn't changed a bit. Selena looks more lost and I have to say, her acting could've been better.

It all started out great with an interesting plot and drive. But, then apple products started popping up everywhere. It felt like watching a very long apple commercial.

Maybe it's just me, but I have no interests in watching what's obviously product placements in a series or film, even if Steve and Martin headlines it.

So, after 3 episodes, I found something else to watch."
1.0,12 August 2023,"A pretty awful vanity project for Steve Martin and Martin Short.

I watched the whole of the first season (on Disney+ in the UK) and that was as much as I wanted to see. My biggest problem with the first season is that Oliver Putnam, played by Martin Short, is such an appalling human being with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Clearly, much of this is down to bad writing. But Martin Short and his directors also need some of the ""credit"" for not toning down what was written. And I just couldn't believe that Oliver Putnam had ever been a functioning director of musical theatre -- I just couldn't suspend my disbelief.

And as a male who is closer to Steve Martin's age than Selena Gomez's, I found the sexual relationship between his character and Amy Ryan's character to be rather vomit inducing. And another instance of my not being able to suspend my disbelief.

All in all, this seems a rather muddled production. It should really hang on the chemistry between the three ""investigators"", but there is little actual chemistry there. So, give this one a miss, unless you're really desperate for something to watch."
1.0,28 August 2022,I expect more from this tv show especially with this actor and actress . I can read everything before happening like many times I watched in other movies or tv shows . I really expected more from this powerful team . When you watched something like modern family in comedy genre or west world or archive 81 in mystery and especially those tv shows made few years ago some how we expect something better in this genres . We should step forward not stop or even step back . The only thing i can say about this tv shows is just OK. It rated 8.1 and i believe it's only because of selena gomez i can't see any other reason . She is a good actress and she proved this 15 years ago.
1.0,6 October 2021,Loved Steve Martin in the 80-90s comedies but this comedy/mystery is too strange and gonzo. Short and Gomez doesnt help.
4.0,22 November 2021,"With Steve Martin & Martin Short, I expected this to be really funny. But it wasn't funny. I made it through 1 episode and partially through the 2nd & gave up."
3.0,23 January 2022,"Maybe this is for the younger ones, they might like it - I cant even call this a comedy , its slow and boring - cant understand People rate this so high, Little cool with sting , only good I can say."
2.0,31 January 2023,"This is not comedy. When we think about comedy we must laugh. I mean, ok, well a big laughter is hard to achieve but even small smile is not the case for me. Let's compare this with seinfeld, I remember laughing in each episode of it. On the contrary, Although I watched this serial up to six episodes I did not even smile. So there is a classificaton problem here.

Secondly, as far as I remember in Episode 6 a made up story was told about Turks. Turkish people, who opened their cities to spanish jews in 15th century, were accused of holocoust. When you do a favour to a good person, by default you expect from that good person goodness. But unfortunately this is not the case here in this serial. Do not watch it, I stopped watching after episode6."
4.0,14 September 2021,"Just fabulous fun , Matin Short is freaking awesome."
4.0,12 September 2021,"You've got the combined comic talent of Steve Martin (who, ok, hasn't really done much in recent times) and Martin Short (an acquired taste) involved in this, so surely it should've been better than it ends up being.

Ok, but certainly nothing special."
4.0,17 October 2021,"Martin Short and Steve Martin haven't been funny in years and Selena is just mediocre in this. Shame because Steve was hilarious before, say, in The Jerk. I have never understood why New York seriously believes it is the best place on earth, especially with so many people moving out of it. The excessive cursing may be normal for New York, but it is not for the rest of us.

It's okay if you have nothing better to watch."
5.0,28 June 2022,"How is this a ""Good, ""Clean"" series when practically every character drops a million F-Bombs?! I swear too, though as I've gotten older (56), I've really cut back cuz I've realized it's just not an attractive trait to have especially in the office or out in public. Sorry but that's my top complaint about this series. Who are they trying to target with that kinda language anyways?

When I asked my 86yo mom if she liked this series, she didn't like the swearing and said it was too boring as well. Too many times ""hell"" should've been said instead of F-bombs or ""$h1t""... the sentences didn't make sense with how they were said. This just isn't a funny LOL kind of series like it was being hyped up as. A few sorta funny moments in episodes 1&2 does not make up for the boring, tired writing that's being played out. I grew up on Steve Martin records (King Tut rules!), movies & SNL even got a ""I'm a wild & crazy gal"" t-shirt with the bunny ears and arrow going thru it from my sister when I was 10 & wore it proudly! Loved most of his movies and liked some of Martin Shorts too (many were too over-the-top for my taste like ""Clifford"") but I had much higher expectations from them both though. Sad to say, I'm not actually too surprised at how lame much of this is. I wanted to like Selena Gomez but like others have commented, her monotone voice and acting like she's so bored during her scenes has been a huge turnoff. I guess that's how they wanted her character to sound & act? All 3 are Executive Producers so if she wanted to not act bored, she could've said or done something about it.

I'm on episode 4 now and do like seeing the guest stars like Nathan Lane and even Sting so far and I'll most likely watch thru the remaining season 1 just to see more of the background storylines (maybe that'll help me like it?) and to see what happens to the killer who I've already guessed by episode 2. But I won't be watching anymore seasons of this sadly and mom refuses to watch anymore of it too (she only made it thru the first episode!)."
1.0,21 July 2022,"I found myself binging the show, I wanted to switch off, numerous times I was so irritated and annoyed by this show, many absolutely stupid things happen, you can forgive them because the whole show is light and doesn't really care all that much.

There are some decent elements to the show, It is quite fun in some ways, but its mind numbingly bad in others, most of the jokes are cringe worthy, some of the events are downright nonsensical and either written like that because ""who cares, its a light comedy mystery show with big name stars"" or they really are stupid and don't care, the police in the show are stupid I guess.

If you want to switch off and not care and just have some light fun, it could work for you.

If you want something a bit deeper with some realism and decent jokes, Id suggest passing on it."
3.0,17 December 2022,"I can't quite get attached to this. Having grown up on Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and Murder She Wrote, I wanted a murder mystery that had some semblance to these shows. And I was hoping OMITB would live up to that. Initially, I did have my doubts - how could two comic actors provide the edge needed for such genre? I'm thinking how effective Benedict Cumberbatch was in his take on Holmes.

Well, doubts are proven true. OMITB feels more like a vehicle for Martin and Short, built with trademark comedic elements peculiar to both of them, in which the murder mystery feels more like a support act rather than the framework on which the show ought to be built upon. There's also too much introspection on the part of characters, some of which doesn't add anything substantive to the plot. And that part with Sting? What is that? How was his character even necessary to the plot? It just gets mired in silliness. I'm surprised the legend from The Police was even willing to take part in such a portrayal. He certainly doesn't need the paycheque.

The acting's generally ok, you get what you've always expected from Martin, Short, and Nathan Lane. On that, even Sting pulls his weight through, despite the limitation on his self portrayal. For a singer who hasn't acted much after his Dune days, his timing remains spot on. On the other hand, Selena Gomez looks and feels lame, it's like she could only come up with a single expression delivered in a monotone, in each episode. You wish she'd take up some acting lessons to at least convey a modicum of emotions instead of looking blank.

Nope, I won't venture into S2."
5.0,27 June 2022,"This is a show for those with simple minds that are either nostalgic for the simple investigation shows of the 60s or those who have never in their life watched a murder mystery show ... Or a comedy show... Or any show that can be considered good. Selena Gomez is just such a terrible actor and she can't even play a character that has basically no character, and then there's the mystery....you'll never guess who....because they use the tired BS trope of pretending the character doesn't exist until much further in the season...wow such a mystery...not, reality is this is just so cliche, bland, and boring, but maybe that's all the gereatrics can comprehend?"
4.0,23 February 2022,"Hello.

This series, which I watched and followed with love, made me sad with the last one I watched. In some of the lines in the 6th episode, there were sentences that gave wrong historical information about the citizens of Turkey and Greece. As a Turkish citizen, I condemn the creation of a different perception by distorting and distorting history in such TV series. I find it meaningless and unnecessary to try to create polarization by giving such false information about the Turkish and Greek peoples.

Thank you."
5.0,20 October 2021,
4.0,13 July 2022,It's too silly! And how can someone really produce and watch this....and produce this! Dram is easy to make but comedy is a challenge! Pity to see such excelente actors doing so stupid things. But I believe that's a issue.
3.0,2 December 2021,"Not bad, especially compared to the horrid crap currently on TV. The acting is good, the writing decent and I like the mystery within the mystery. Although I'm not sure it has a lot of longevity."
5.0,23 September 2021,"A cool & relevant concept but it's just not interesting enough. A lot of fluff & not enough intriguing content. Love Steve Martin in this but that's about it. I could not stay focused on this show. Selena was not a good fit for this role. She's monotone, no expression, dry & seemingly emotionless & robotic. Kind of feels like a missed opportunity, unfortunately. Potential is there but sadly, there seems to be too much going on for me and not enough of that seems purposeful for the actual story. A bit boring, the mark was missed..."
4.0,29 October 2021,"OK! New Yorkers (especially the sexually harassing governor) The cops are bad unless they are a black plus size lesbian(We understood Leftw00d) Now defund police and enforce the law with the podcast.

Two great comedians, Steve Martin and Martin Short, are very far from a comedy in this series, so I got bored and the show was boring."
5.0,28 December 2022,"I still get amazed at these zealot fools who write negative reviews because of language they didn't like? Are you that dumb you can't see it's rated R or MA for coarse language...? Why are you watching stuff you know you'll cry about?

Like knowing there's gay sex and you watch it, then complain lol.. If you're such a prude and your beliefs SUCK why bother watching anything? Talk about entitlement

Anyways the show is ruined by Selena Gomez. The two dudes who are supposed to be actual actors aren't much better here either, so you know this is a stinker. Father of the Bride, there's a true comedy with Steve Martin / Martin Short."
5.0,5 November 2023,"I was looking forward to this show but, unfortunately, Martine Short overacts and his ""acting"" is eerily like his parody work on SCTV. It is distracting and very disappointing. You can't help but wonder why is Steve Martin continuing to collaborate with a shill?

Martin and Gomez are very good and appropriately restrained. Short acts like he is in vaudeville show.

Replace Short and it's passable or, at the very least, get him to tone it down.

The locale is amazing. What a beautiful building, which is clearly a feature but it is a bit distracting to the storyline. I have only watched the first few episode so, hopefully, it will improve."
7.34,29 December 2021,"I can't believe this show averages over 8 on imdb. And for the life of me, I can't even begin to fathom why.

1. It sucks so much at being funny. Really, you laughed here? Where, when, why? The jokes are terrible, they systematically fall flat. It reminds me of those outdated burlesque plays, those buffooneries where everything and everyone is over the top all the time, and which are just pathetically lame. Grimaces and smirks, that make you laugh? Come on!

2. Steve Martin and Martin Short are constantly hamming it up, and God, it's exhausting to watch.

I've always been a huge fan of Steve Martin's speeches but found his on-screen performances mostly boring... That show is a new low for him. Same for Martin Short. Their acting is as subtle as an elephant in a china store.

3. Don't get me started on the so-called whodunnit. WTF is that far-fetched plot? It's half-baked, clumsy, unrelatable. And most of all, not interesting in the slightest. I honestly couldn't care less about their podcast, the murder itself.

And to think that some really incredible and bold shows are being cancelled after one season while this lukewarm broth has been renewed several times..."
7.34,16 September 2021,I can't believe some of these reviews giving this show high ratings and it is absolutely terrible. An 8.4 rating? I love Steve Martin. But this is very badly done. Couldn't make it past the second episode.
7.34,23 October 2021,"The show is ok, mediocre at best. The Martins are the most enjoyable part of the show.

It's a 4/10. 2 pts for Steve & Martin. And 2 pts for a low rent mystery.

Suggestions for S2. 1st Drop the monotone boring emotionless Gomez, leave her in jail. 2nd Find someone older than 13 years old to help insert the vulgar language. It just was so unnatural and out of place most of the time in S1."
7.34,23 September 2021,"It was a series that I loved watching at first, but the 6th episode contains errors. Please! You're not reporting history objectively. The Turks didn't commit massacres or genocide. You can not portray Turks badly in the media. YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE!!"
7.34,16 September 2021,But three episodes were all I could take. Slow and predictable.
7.34,26 November 2021,"The best way to describe how it feels trying to like it is if you ever tried lifting 110% of your maximum weightlifting load. It's extremely difficult and those moments when it seems doable are so deceptive.

The plot and the lines are *horribly* bland, like I literally have a feeling that funnier lines would've been more expensive to make so here I am wasting my time because I couldn't afford something better to watch.

By the 5th episode I got even angry at them because it's now clear they just made a show about themselves to themselves and imaginary fans because if they didn't they'd actually have to try harder."
7.34,28 October 2023,"There was a murder in the building, and no one looked worried or scary. It looks like everyone was having fun and didn't care.

Not even the police cared. They were trying to solve the murder mystery, but instead they are doing podcasts. And recording everything like a funny joke.

I wanted to feel like there was a murder and they would be worried and find the mystery with suspense instead of Charles dating Jan, Oliver family history, etc.

They are showing Oliver Putnam a mystery from childhood, but Oliver has an 8-month rent due. How come a man does not know how to earn money, get a job, and pay rent but knows everything about murder cases?

And the podcast fans were waiting on the street for days that weren't funny to watch.

The mystery was good, but the way they found it wasn't good. I would give 10/10 if it was an art thief mystery."
7.34,15 September 2024,"In Only Murders in the Building Season 1, Episode 6, I noticed a portrayal that seems to touch on a recurring theme in some U. S. productions: Turks being depicted in a negative light, particularly in relation to Greeks. I find it curious, as historically, after the events of the early 20th century, the Turkish and Greek nations have maintained a relatively peaceful relationship. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the founder of modern Turkey, is even known to have shown great respect towards Greece, famously refusing to step on a Greek flag.

Today, Turkish and Greek cultures are incredibly similar, and many people from both nations regard each other as friends. So, it makes me wonder why certain narratives continue to portray conflict between them. It feels like these portrayals might be missing the nuanced relationship these two nations share.

Perhaps it's worth considering the broader impact of such portrayals in popular media, especially when it comes to fostering understanding and peace between nations. It's always important to question the motives behind recurring stereotypes and their influence on public perception."
7.34,10 July 2022,"I was very dissapointed and thought it was a cheesy show. There was a lot of language and that was part of the reason that I had to stop watching it. I love comedies but did not think the show was that funny at all. I thought the storyline was clever, but would not recommend it."
7.34,13 September 2024,"I love all the actors, but I don't know if I will continue watching. So sorry. You need to consider that not all the fans are Democrats. It is now more of the same. I'm sure Selena who is the worst on the series suggests this. Selena Gomes why in all your pics on Instagram you look so thin and on the series soooo big. Please take some acting lessons and try not to use politics on the series. With your insignificant self is enough. Congratulations on the rest. Try not to suck. I grow up with all the cast and I love you guys. Except on the insignificant Selena. Please please please leave the politics out of the show."
7.34,14 September 2023,"""Only Murders In the Building"" Season 3 delves into intriguing mysteries yet again, but this time, not without some notable shortcomings.

One aspect that marred the viewing experience was the portrayal of interactions with the Deaf character, Theo. It's evident that the show failed to conduct thorough research into how Deaf individuals converse. The countless instances of Mable turning her back to Theo, expecting him to understand her without clear lip movements, were a cringe-worthy oversight. Effective communication with Deaf individuals relies on exaggerated lip movements, which was notably absent here.

Furthermore, the performance of the character Mable left much to be desired. Whether it's due to apparent Botox or plastic surgery work, her lack of facial expressions became a significant distraction. Scenes involving her felt monotonous and lacked the emotional depth needed to fully engage the audience.

However, the saving grace of the season lies in the performances of Charles and Oliver. Their chemistry and charisma shine through, elevating the show. If not for the offensive representation of the Deaf community and Mable's limited facial expressions, this season had the potential to be a perfect 10. Instead, it stands at a middling 5 stars, held back by its missteps in these critical areas."
7.34,15 August 2023,"No issue with the story here, but like a lot of programmes they have relied heavily on showing notes and texts on screen.

I have a slight vision problem. Not enough to stop me enjoying watching TV, but enough so I can't read text on my TV from my sofa.

Constantly having to pause playback and get up and walk across to the TV to read the texts shown on the screen completely ruined it for me, particularly the episode which focused on the deaf character and was pretty much completely reliant on subtitles. If I wanted to read a book, I would.

Add to that the fact that most of Selena Gomez's lines are mumbled, and it wasn't a great viewing experience for me."
7.34,12 July 2022,"I remember when Blazing Saddles came out, one critic condensing his review to saying it was some well-liked stars using vulgar language. Wow, the f-word was only mouthed, just once. I didn't like that they joked about rape, which seemed to be a thing in '70s comedy.

Here we are in 2022 (the series began last year). I had only seen the first 2 episodes when it began, and got sidetracked. This weekend, I decided to catch-up, after learning the 2nd season had begun. But seeing stars I once thought highly of, along with unknown middleaged & senior actors reduced to speaking like poorly educated street trash (what Trump era gave us), I just couldn't stomach it. Glad I didn't buy the DVD or BluRay set!

Years ago, I learned and still believe that people who resort to using gutter language, are too poorly educated to think of any other words to express their feelings. More precise would be they are too morally poor. And as demonstrated by the applause when late night host use the f-word, although censored on TV, they use that language to appeal to the segment of society that thinks it cool for their fav celebs to talk dirty."
7.34,21 November 2021,Great story and acting too. It's a shame they feel everybody talks or appreciates garbage language. Wonder how many complaints they'd get that there just aren't enough F bombs in the show? Too bad they limited their audience on this one.
7.34,13 October 2023,"Each episode lasts approx. 30 minuted and but only 10 minutes are related to a dead person in second episode. First episode has more talking and events about deal person.

But in generally we see only talking in Only Murders in the Building. Almost nothing else. That's why it's boring. Maybe other episodes are better but i don't want to watch them.

There are many off-topic events. For example, n actor goes to his adult kid asking him for help, his kid doesn't want to help him. Another off-topic event is showing memory or female actor. Since not related to murder in hotel, i don't like it. Looks like off-topic events are used to delay finding murderer. Is murderer found in the last episode of the first season?

There are also many monologues (we don't see who is talking) which are introducing situation like in many other series and movies. I don't like that either."
7.34,7 October 2021,"Really Seriously folks, this show started out just ok. I can forgive the terribly bad acting by Selena Gomez and that for a show with 2 all time great comedy actors there is not even a scene that can make anyone laugh.

Seriously, why have the last 2 episodes had no sound just subtitles because the main person is deaf. That is a total insult and slam in the face to both deaf people and the ones that can hear.

The show does have some promise though.

There are some cons: 1. Yeah slap in the face to disabled people I mean really slap a whole 2 episodes with no sound just subtitles. It is a total FU to Deaf People.

2. Really bad acting (I mean really bad acting. You can watch youtube videos with better acting by a toddler), and yeah for a comedy it is not funny.

Pros: 1 The story aside from the very bad way it is being told is actually interesting.

2. It has Selena Gomez, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. They are actually great actors I just wish they would step up the game. They totally stink in this."
7.34,7 July 2022,"This is a delightful show except for the nasal voice of Mabel which sounds like some auto-tune contraption has been shoved down her throat. I think it would have been even better if it was a couple of episodes shorter. But overall, a must-watch!"
7.34,12 July 2022,"I have no idea what people give it 10 stars. I find it barely watchable, and as usual, Martin Short is very annoying. Maybe if they had a better cast I'd enjoy it more."
7.34,31 August 2023,"Most older viewers will go in to this to see Steve Martin and Martin Short team up while younger viewers are likely here for Selena Gomez. You will certainly get your fill as far as screen time goes, but not quite the best as far as performances go.

All three are fine enough in their roles but we are talking a spoofy murder mystery here.

Steve Martin gets more humor and drama than the others and does well with it and generally being a lot less over the top than we are used to seeing him - which I found refreshing.

Martin Shorts character works more an annoyance that lets others be funny although he does have some funny lines, but much less than we normally see.

Selena Gomez is a bit uneven. She works best when she is investigating and not so good when she is supposed to be emotional. It can't be easy holding your own with this cast, but I do think she held her ground pretty well.

The story is a spoof about crime murder podcasts and manages to go through many different phases during the 10 episode run. It started strong and then ambles along very pleasantly until it."
7.34,10 May 2024,"So many good things about this show!! Great cast - who knew they would have chemistry?! Steve Martin and Martin Short are comedic geniuses and then add in Selena. Banter between them was classic. Show is well-written and the dialogue is witty, light-hearted and funny. The story has twists and turns. And best of all, it captures NYC people dynamics so well. Meetings between random people, paranoia about your neighbors, eating at the local deli, mingling with artsy types. It's all true and hilarious at the same time.

I discovered this show while sick with the flu, and I highly recommend watching. It's just what the doctor ordered."
7.34,26 February 2024,"So how do I start telling everyone I like the show? Oh well, I like it. It is a light crime/detective show, like a board game filled with other funny events. I have to admit I was looking for something else but I did not get disappointed after the first episodes. I cannot remember when I saw Steve Martin and Martin Short last time. To be honest I did not even know they were still in the business. Both of them are so genuine and natural and so refreshing. Totally worth spending time watching it and also loved the fact that they attached various artists to the show like Sting and Meryl and Paul."
7.34,3 January 2024,"This series of 30-minute episodes is a HULU original. It just completed its 3rd season in 2023, there are 40 episodes in all. We had not watched any of it because we are not subscribed.

Now, as 2024 begins, the ABC network, which we catch via antenna in our attic, has started to broadcast episodes, starting with season 1, episode 1. The first night they broadcast the first 3 episodes, with commercials, over a 2-hour time slot. Same a week later, then also the next week. Now the last night, January 23rd, is the single, last episode.

The show is from a Steve Martin idea, here he plays one of the three main characters, actor Charles-Haden Savage and in the 1990s played a character, a New York detective, called Brazzos. What a curious name, most likely a result of Martin's sense of humor. Back in 1945 he was born in Waco, Texas, a city on the Brazos river, and his character Brazzos is most likely an homage' to his birthplace.

The second main character is another 70-something, Martin Short as stage director Oliver Putnam, who seems to have fallen on hard financial times and now is in danger of losing his prime Manhattan apartment. Not a big fan of the actor, his variety of humor rarely connects with our sensibilities.

The third main character is 30-ish Selena Gomez as Mabel Mora. So far it isn't very clear what her job is but she seems to be renovating her aunt's apartment. She is a good addition to the three-person team who were all mutual strangers at first.

Against expectations the three of them develop an interesting and entertaining Chemistry right away. Motivated by a podcast they all admire, they decide to solve murders, but only the ones that take place in their building.

It is interesting, being a TV broadcast, they bleep out all profanity and it demonstrates that profanity is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY if you have a good story.

So, as with most crime entertainment shows, as things develop the audience is led to suspect a range of different characters as the murderer, at the same time led to not believe certain characters could be. And, some twists at the end are designed to surprise.

My wife and I enjoyed it, as light and interesting entertainment. I especially like Steve Martin, we may or may not watch season two if it is broadcast on ABC."
7.34,29 November 2021,"When I saw the ad for this on Hulu and decided to give it a chance. I turned on the first episode and then got hooked. Steve, Marty and Selena have incredible chemistry. Can't wait for season 2!"
7.34,4 March 2024,"I loved the characters and I thought the casting was excellent - I had never heard of Selena Gomez but I loved her in this.

It is very light going with a scattering of jokes and mild drama.

There is the odd speciality episode like the one without any spoken dialogue.

Other reviewers have stated that, although alright, this is not as great as people make out.

Technically they are absolutely right - it isn't ground shattering stuff.

But as a fan of the likes of ""Monk"", ""Jonathan Creek"", ""Rizzoli & Isles"" it feels like there has not been anything new in the same vein for quite a while.

This is good, honest, light, sleuthy fun and the smile on my face as I watched every episode justifies my 9 star rating alone.

*EDIT SEASON 2* Season 2 starts of very shaky with some clumsy attempts at humour that don't land and Amy Schumer stomping through the middle of the plot like a bull at a tea party.

But by episode 3 it is all back on track Well done!"
