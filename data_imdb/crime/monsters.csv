8.0,21 September 2022,"I had high expectations of this. After seeing Evan Peters in AHS, I just knew he would be great in this role. He did not disappoint.

I haven't seen many docos on Dahmer so don't really know that much about his personality or demeanor, but the character that Peters portrays is complex, creepy, and just plain twisted and evil.

One of the most disturbing details of Dahmer's crimes that this series highlights is how the police ignored and dismissed witness reports, and their lack of action allowed Dahmer to stay free and kill more men.

This series is excellent. I suggest you start watching it early in the afternoon as you will want to binge watch the whole series."
9.0,21 September 2022,"This was a hard watch....for many reasons. Having been a young adult when all this happened, it....what do the kids say?...it hits different.

Well, it's the Dahmer story. So by default, it's hard and gross and scary.

The acting is top notch. Every performance...it's like you're right there in the room watching this God awful series of events unfold in real time. How the actors got through this is beyond me.

The timeline shifts can be a bit hard to follow. It's not the kind of thing you can just pause and come back to. You have to rewind or start the episode over.

Overall, arguably...this is the best Dahmer depiction. I would recommend watching ""My Best Friend Dahmer"" prior to watching this, as it accidentally and appropriately serves as a prequel.

Recommend for cast iron stomachs. Don't watch this if you're prone to puking."
9.0,21 September 2022,"When I clicked to watch the ""Dahmer""-release on Netflix, I thought it would be the so-many'th documentary on him. But what a surprise it was to see that it is actually a mini-series of the crimes that Dahmer committed. And what a mini-series it is!

The acting is superb. The script is top-notch! The cinematography one of the best that I have seen in a true crime series of a serial killer!

I am a big fan of Mindhunter, the show about the origins of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit. And I must admit that Dahmer fits right into this type of shows! The show captured me from the first episode and it was a single binge from then on.

I know that there are many other movies from for instance ""People's Magazine"" that portray the crimes commited by notorious killers. But what Netflix has shown with Dahmer, is a complete new level of enactment! The movies from People's Magazine are just amateur hour compared to the Dahmer-series.

Netflix really surprised me big time with this great show! It deserves a solid 9 stars! And I don't easily give away a 9 star rating!"
10.0,22 September 2022,"There are no doubts that Evan Peters has killed this role by delivering one of the most engrossing performances of his career, and that's saying something considering the aptitude of his many esteemed performances to date. Dahmer's entire childhood outfitted for audiences to get a further in depth understanding of his delving into degeneracy and the reasons behind his atrocious actions. The fault of a system that didn't care about helping those who showed signs of psychosis and allowed a young man to fall through the cracks along with a corrupt and negligent police department that chose to turn blind eyes and deaf ears due to the nature of homosexuality and people of color being Dahmer's main victims because of obvious systemic racism...all of it set to Evan's performance was outstanding. I can only hope people learn from the many lessons this horrible tragedy, but the engrossing way that Mr. Peter's acted in this very challenging role is an absolute stunner."
9.0,22 September 2022,"For those interested in the psychology of a serial killer, there is no more fascinating character study than Jeffrey Dahmer. He was a psychiatric enigma and a profoundly sick individual. A chronic alcoholic from a very young age. A sexual deviant with all manner of unusual fetishes. A necrophiliac. A cannibal.

A pure psychopath and the product of a perfect storm of schizotypal/borderline personality disorder, developmental toxicity (exposure to psychoactive drugs in utero), negative parental influence, neglect and childhood trauma, a morbid curiosity with the macabre, social exclusion at school and deep feelings of loneliness, sexual confusion and insecurity.

He longed to be cared about and loved by his family. He longed to be accepted by his peers. But, at the same time, knew deep down that he would inevitably disappoint his parents because of his inability to live a normal life and that he wouldn't be accepted by friends due to his odd personality.

We all tend to seek out like-minded people and make connections with those we have something in common with. The problem was that Jeffrey knew there wasn't anybody out there with the same interests or outlook as him. Left to his own devices by absent parents and socially isolated, he became increasingly withdrawn and followed a path of introversion and solitude.

He must have felt like he didn't belong in this world, and that there wasn't a place for him within society, so he abandoned all attempts to participate and pursued a voyeuristic way of life. He lacked a clear or positive self-image, meaning his perspective of other people was skewed, which resulted in him fully embracing his warped perception of pleasure and satisfaction. The men he felt attracted to were purely sex objects to him; walking, talking sex dolls. His interest was solely in their aesthetic, or physical appearance.

He appeared to have been a deeply troubled soul from the outset and his behaviours were predominantly a consequence of his genetic constitution, exacerbated by negative life experiences. If his childhood had been a more positive one then he may have been able to adapt better to his personal limitations and dysfunctions, but there is no way of knowing the extent of the damage his upbringing had on him.

It was evident from his own admissions that he felt predestined to live a peculiar and unorthodox lifestyle due to his innately bizarre persona. The conventional joys of life simply didn't float Jeffrey's boat.

I rarely, if ever, feel sorry for multiple murderers, especially ones who commit such heinous and sickening crimes as Dahmer. But I have to admit that I found his story to be tragically sad.

My usual take away from accounts of serial killers is wondering how and why someone could do that to another human being over and over again!? In Dahmer's case, I am left feeling conflicted with a strange understanding of, and empathy for, his actions. Of course I'm not condoning what he did, but I can appreciate how and why the sequence of events transpired.

In his televised interviews he was so open, frank and forthcoming which is exceptionally rare for someone in his situation. He came across as a gentle, thoughtful and articulate person who was genuinely tormented by his inner demons throughout his life. He freely admitted to his crimes in detail, demonstrated that he knew what he had done was evil and offered honest explanations for his actions. He wanted to pay the ultimate price for his sins, resisting advice to make a plea of insanity, and took personal responsibility for the choices he made.

The good part of him wanted to change and stop what the bad part had started, but he required external intervention to do so. The urges and compulsions that controlled him became an obsession and his psychosis led him down a progressively irreversible path that was impossible to resist. The dark side had an unrelenting grip on him.

My personal opinion is that he was clinically insane, due to a combination of psychiatric disorders, but at the same time I feel a legal judgement of insanity would have been an insult to the families of Dahmer's victims and an inadequate penalty for such a fiendish series of killings.

If you listen to him describe how he felt during his childhood and adolescence, it's clear that he should have been under the watchful eye of mental health professionals from an early age. His mother was so wrapped up in her own mental illness and his father preoccupied by work that he didn't receive the emotional support, medication and therapy he desperately needed. This was inexcusable given that both parents were acutely aware of their own emotional problems and the likelihood that these had been passed onto their son.

I can't help but feel pity for Dahmer, and also that the casualties of his maniacal way of life were preventable.

Between his mid-teens and early twenties he was basically a ""walking cry for help"" but nobody seemed to pay attention, try to understand him or find out what was wrong. In any case, because of the appalling and unspeakable nature of Dahmer's fantasies, it's unlikely that he would have felt able to share them with anyone, even those in a medical capacity. This would've made him feel trapped and that he might as well turn his fantasies into a reality because there was nobody to confide in and no way out of his spiralling mental condition. Like a lost cause.

I mean here was a guy who felt completely alone in the world. A total and utter misfit. So reckless and uncaring about what other people thought of him, making absolutely no attempts whatsoever to conform to social norms. A loner without even a rudimentary inclination or understanding of how to make friends, relate to others or find a romantic partner. He didn't seem to know what to look for or what he wanted in a partner. His perverted version of attachment and sexual arousal didn't allow him to.

I suppose all he had experienced was watching his parents at constant loggerheads and in a loveless marriage. This would have left him detached, emotionally stunted and unaware of how to express love and affection. I suspect realising that you're homosexual is a troubling and confusing time for anyone. But for someone like Dahmer, who was mentally unhinged and devoid of emotional support, it was a major dilemma and yet another psychological obstacle to contend with.

He was given such an unstable start to life by bickering, neglectful parents who appeared to be unwilling to put their children's welfare first. This obviously had a massively detrimental impact on his self-esteem and sense of security, leading to an intense fear of abandonment. Hence his preference for duping his victims into spending time with him and then incapacitating them so he could enjoy their company without that fear of rejection. That way he could exercise total control over their lifeless bodies and indulge in his fetishes to his heart's content without contest.

I expect he sank to unimaginable depths of depravity during those private moments, searching for the unachievable, ever-fleeting sense of fulfilment and satisfaction that he desperately wished to hold on to and savour.

I've read quite a lot about Dahmer online, watched a number of interviews and the brilliant film 'My Friend Dahmer'. Evan Peters portrays him with a seemingly effortless and convincing performance that is heavily nuanced and intensely creepy. He absolutely nails the flat affect, monotone voice and distinct lack of emotional expression typical of most psychopaths.

He really conveys the emptiness Dahmer had in his soul; the numbness, subdued anger and sexual frustration which engulfed him. He truly embodies Dahmer and was perfectly cast in this role.

Technically speaking this series is very well researched, skilfully put together and held my undivided attention throughout. The acting by the whole cast, especially Richard Jenkins as Lionel, is first class. The tone is pitched perfectly for such a grim and sordid story. The directors create numerous moments of highly suspenseful and tense drama including some horrifying, darkly-intimate and cringe-inducing scenes, but these are needed to tell the story of Dahmer's debauchery in full.

Episode 6 ""Silenced"" in particular is an exceptional and highly original piece of screenwriting with some of the most absorbing television I've seen for a long time. It was like a mini-masterpiece of melodrama.

I really feel the writers got inside the mind of Dahmer, not only giving us the facts of what happened but allowing us to feel what it was like to see things the way he did. There are a number of minor adjustments or expansions to the narrative, but equally some omissions in order to make the content more palatable for the viewer. None of this affects the credibility of the series in my opinion as we are given ample opportunity to form a mental image of what happened from the point of view of all parties concerned.

Despite having read up on the subject matter beforehand, and knowing how the events of his life unfolded, this excellent series has a real edginess and provides a fresh, unflinching and comprehensive account of the disturbing life of Jeffrey Dahmer.

If like me you're fascinated by how a monster like Dahmer is formed, you're in for a real treat."
8.0,31 December 2022,"Monster is a series created by Ryan Murphy (American Crime Story, American Horror Story, 9-1-1, Hollywood, Pose, Feud, etc.). Everything Murphy touches is pretty much successful and this is no different. Everyone knows this story by now...he's one of the most notorious serial killers in the history of the United States. He would lure young men to his apartment and not only kill them but eat them. This is a story that's been told many times but this show takes the unique perspective of largely telling the story from the victims point of view. Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant as Jeffrey Dahmer. He's so good that he should be talked about for an Emmy nomination next year. This series is worth watching for Peters performance alone. This is very dark, disturbing story and Ryan Murphy does a great job telling it."
10.0,21 September 2022,"There's something dramatic, intense about how that man can transform into his character.

The producer (Ryan Murphy) has been working with Evan for more than a decade on American Horror Story so we've seen him in a few different roles and I'm always stunned at his talent.

Murphy's been known to produce gems or the worst; worth a binge this one.

Only 2 episodes in so my rating might change but this is a solid show with solid acting and even though some might find the start to be ""slow"", if you love creepy thrillers you're in for a wild ride and will love the pace.

Loving the sometimes ""eerie filming"", there's a sinister vibe in every aspects of the show!"
7.0,26 September 2022,This is a solid true crime show with brilliant acting. Especially Evan Peters does an awesome job. It's exciting to see the horrible story of JD staged so carefully. Would have been an 8 but the last two episodes focus too much on JDs neighbour Glenda Cleveland. She surely suffered a lot when JDs crimes were discovered but 15 people had been killed whose friends and families certainly suffered a lot more. I think those people deserve more attention than a lady that indeed did a good job but was not involved in the matter so much. That's why the last episodes are a little bit slow moving. All in all worth a watch.
8.0,27 September 2022,"I want to star off by saying Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer story (what a ridiculous title) is a very tough watch. I grew up about 30min from Milwaukee and even though I was a little kid when he was arrested I still remember this story being a huge, especially around here. How he was able to get away with what he did for as long as he did is very troubling. The police dropped the ball time and time again and lots of innocent lives were lost because of it. Evan Peters deserves every bit of recognition he's getting from this series, he was brilliant. The rest of the cast is good too but it's Peters who makes this show what it is."
6.0,26 September 2022,"While Evan Peters certainly deserves accolades for his particularly engrossing and gripping personification of the monster that was Dahmer, the series - the first half of which was excellent - leaves much to be desired.

Note: A special mention should also be made of actor Shaun Brown who delivered a stellar performance in his portrayal of Tracy Edwards, Dahmer's last would-be victim.

Like a good book that you just do not want to put down and which leaves you wanting to know what the next page will bring, the first episode of ""Dahmer, Monster"" is compelling enough that if you have the time, you will not even think about turning off episode two.

The issues, for me, began around episode 5. This is when the story began to move away from Dahmer and his actions somewhat, and began to concentrate on other aspects of the case and the people who surrounded him. This disconnect just grew and grew into the ensuing episodes, with Dahmer being present, less and less. While some viewers may not have minded this, and perhaps viewed it as being 'thorough', to me, it was fluff and fill. There's is no convincing me that this series would not have benefitted from being two episodes shorter. In fact, you could turn it off at episode 6, and could truthfully say you saw it in its entirety, ...or at least all its best parts."
10.0,22 September 2022,"Starting in July 25, 1991, notorious serial murderer Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) is arrested when Dahmer's potential victim Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown) miraculously escapes and brings the police back to his apartment. Dahmer is arrested after uncovering the various horrors and mementos from Dahmer's murders, we soon go back through Dahmer's past to see what lead him to this point before eventually shifting focus to the stories of the victims, the fallout felt by the community and victims' families, as well as the bureaucratic and law enforcement failures that allowed Dahmer to continue indulging his twisted appetites.

Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is the latest project from noted producer Ryan Murphy whose prolific work on the likes of American Horror and Crime Story lead to him getting an overall deal with streamer Netflix. Beginning development in 2020, the miniseries is the fourth dramatic take on the infamous serial killer following three independent productions, 1992's The Secret Life, 2002's Dahmer, and 2017's My Friend Dahmer receiving very degrees of responses with My Friend Dahmer arguably the best of the three. When the miniseries was first announced I was skeptical because I didn't think there was any more to be told about Dahmer than we'd already learned from years of rubbernecking let alone three film attempts, but much to my surprise I found this miniseries to not only exceed my expectations, but shattered them as Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the year's best TV shows and if you end up seeing only one Dahmer related piece of media in your life, make it this one.

While the show may be titled after serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, he's only half of what this movie is about. While the first 3 or four episodes dive extensively into Dahmer's childhood from age six where he first began to manifest his macabre interest in dead animals and dissecting them through his teens and 20s where we see the effects of Dahmer's unstable homelife, repressed homosexuality, and darkening appetites, the movie places more focus on the lead-up to Dahmer's actions as well as the fallout that came after the horrifying revelations came to light (and not just with Dahmer himself). Intermixed with the scenes of Dahmer socially engineering his victims, struggling with keeping his compulsions in check, or failure to maintain professional and personal relationships, we're shown a series of failures either through incompetence, apathy, distraction or neglect that disregard the obvious warning signs surrounding Dahmer as he deals with barely concealed issues that are missed by parents, educators, law enforcement, or administrative officials with those who actually try to shine a light on Dahmer's actions ignored at best or punished or threatened with punishment at worst. This is a show that despite being set in the early 90s is no less prescient today with issues such as systemic racism and homophobia still very much allowing inaction or harm to victims, and an award ceremony scene where two police officers are rewarded for simply avoiding responsibility for handing a child over to Dahmer will make your blood boil with how little has changed in regards to the ""blue wall of silence"" and the corruption of police unions in keeping unfit officers out of the profession.

The acting is solid across the board. Evan Peters is really good is the titular Dahmer as he captures the tragedy of his situation in the early years, but Peters and the creative team don't try to use this as an excuse or easy answer (an epilogue says as much there's no simple answer) and Dahmer's metamorphosis from struggling confused adolescent to cold calculating opportunistic predator who justifies his actions with a false victimhood complex makes it clear that Dahmer's actions have no ""out"" from his responsibility for them. The movie is an ensemble and features a number of characters either recurring or one off who are integral to the plot. Easily my favorite comes in the form of deaf actor Rodney Burford who plays Dahmer's victim Tony Hughes and the entire episode is anchored to the POV of this character with characters using ASL to communicate, muffling the audio to create verisimilitude, and you feel like you get to know Hughes in a way we've never been allowed to see before. Make no mistake, this is a starmaking performance from Burford so expect to see much more of him in the future, I guarantee it. The show also features terrific performances from arguably the two ""cores"" of this movie, Niecy Nash as Dahmer's neighbor and until now unsung hero of this story Glenda Cleveland, and veteran character actor Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's torn and conflicted father Lionel.

With Nash's Glenda, we get the feeling of powerlessness and helplessness from the people on the ground affected by Dahmer's actions as noted in the movie that Dahmer lived in a cheap rundown part of Milwaukee and targeted mostly people of color as his victims. While Glenda reports the awful smells coming from Dahmer's apartment to the landlord as well as sounds of screening of fighting to the police, not only is she often ignored, but is shouted down by the police such as the infamous incident wherein officers John balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish took Dahmer's word that 14 year-old Konerak Sinthasomphone was actually his drunk 19 year old boyfriend instead of his victim who'd been given an amateur lobotomy by Dahmer instead of an escaped victim despite Glenda's pleas. The movie isn't excessively gory as the gore is limited to only plot important scenes, but just because it's not as bloody as Saw or Hostel doesn't make it easier to watch and in some cases it's actually harder. Richard Jenkins is really strong as Dahmer's father Lionel and the different points of the story that portray him as wanting to help his son but not knowing how are heartbreaking because you see in Lionel the confusion and discomfort that make him unable to give Dahmer the help he needs because he very much denies there even is a problem and tries to write it off as something that can be cured with tough love or firm guidance. There isn't any singular point of blame you can link to Dahmer (as the show isn't about ""understanding Dahmer""), but the show does give us some potential issues such as a mentally unstable mother, a distant father, and internalized feelings of abandonment, but even then these aren't frame as excuses. The show stays good even after the actual crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are over and done with by the halfway point, as the show shifts focus away from Dahmer and looks at the media fallout, the insane fandom surrounding Dahmer, the exploitation of tabloids and indie comics that trivialize Dahmer and his victims, and to watch these victims and their families be at the mercy of harassing phone calls and invasive pictures by rubbernecking tourists is painful to watch.

If I haven't made it clear, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is one of the best TV projects I've seen this year and I can't recommend it enough. My one point of criticism is I felt certain tangents related to Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy seemed a little out of place and I wasn't sure why they were presented the way they were with such polished detailed flashbacks, but other than that one misstep I really think everyone should see this show."
6.0,1 October 2022,"The show was good and well acted but Glenda Cleveland was given more screen time than any of Dahmer's victims yet she never lived next door to Dahmer, in fact, she didn't even live in the same apartment. So why on a show that aims not to tell the events from Dahmer's point of view did they chose to mainly focus the POV on a woman who had barley anything to do with him? Could it be she is now dead and they don't need her permission to take creative liberties in pushing agendas that (according to reporters at the time) weren't an issue? If so, this means they can't have Glenda herself dispute these claims as she is no longer with us and the victims (who mostly still are) claim to have never been reached out by Netflix for their permission on the show. I wonder why...."
1.0,23 September 2024,"This series is a complete failure in capturing the gravity of the Menendez brothers' story. The portrayal is insensitive, especially in its depiction of abuse, which is disturbingly sexualized and misleading. It downplays the trauma and paints an inaccurate picture of events. The storytelling feels exploitative rather than informative, and completely left out the testimonies of people seeing abuse go on in the household, aswell as the fact that Jose sexually assaulted other young men. Netflix should be disgusted to have this on their streaming service. If you really want to be informed on this case, I would suggest visiting reddit or watching Erik Menendez documentary."
8.0,22 November 2022,"Evan Peters has seriously outdone his job here. His acting was top notch and his portrayal of dahmer, from his clothing to expressions, everything was perfect, perfect everything, down to the last minute details. And apart from him, the performances of the other cast members (His father, his mother, grandma, Glenda cleveland and the victims) were excellent too.

Also, the cinematography and music was impressive. The writing and screenplay was decent too, especially the fact that they didn't did much creative liberties, and hence as a result, the story turned out to be close to the actual events. The only thing i found slightly disappointing was the length. The pace was a bit slow, especially in the last few episodes, and i feel the series could've been easily wrapped up in 8 episodes, instead of 10.

But overall, it's a must watch. Especially for the ones who are interested in the crime thriller genre. It's a realistic take on one of the most notorious series killers in our history, where they haven't romanticized him and in fact, called out the ones who tend to do so. And that's the thing which makes it a bit unique and interesting to watch."
8.0,21 September 2024,"There are two monsters is this heartbreaking and compelling story, but they are not Erik (Cooper Koch) and Lyle (Nicholas Alexander Chavez), they are Jose (Javier Bardem) and Kitty (Chloë Savigny).

I don't want to delve too deeply into the legal aspects of this case, because this is not a documentary, but a dramatic series. However, let me start by saying, if Erik and Lyle had been Erika and Lyla-two daughters-they would never have spent a day in jail. That's not to say that Erik and Lyle were blameless, but the mitigating circumstances were so overwhelming and compelling that they should have been sentenced to voluntary manslaughter with a 10 year sentence.

Then there is Dominic Dunne (Nathan Lane) a despicable man who trafficked in gossip and celebrity cocktail parties. He was sort of a straight Truman Capote.

I want to highlight Episode 5 'The Hurt Man.' There are only two characters in the entire scene: Leslie Abramson (Ari Gaynor) and Erik. Director Michael Upendahl places the camera about 12 feet away from the table where the two are seated. Abramson with her back to the camera (we never see her face) and Lyle facing. Slowly, imperceptibly, the camera pushes in on Erik until it passes Abramson and ends with a close up of Erik as he explains the title of the episode. Riveting!

Cooper Koch does a tremendous job throughout, but especially in that episode. Nicholas Chavez is also terrific as Lyle. Javier Bardem and Chloë Savigny are outstanding as Jose and Kitty."
10.0,21 September 2022,"Suffocating. Nerve destroying. Heart wrenching. Disturbing.

I had high hopes for this being a true crime addict and seeing a decent cast. But this went beyond my expectations. If you're expecting a gore fest you'll be sadly disappointed. If you're expecting a sinister emotional rollercoaster you'll be sated.

Episode 6 is probably one of the saddest and sweetest pieces of television I've ever witnessed in 52 years of being alive. If you know the history of Dahmer you'll know what's coming which makes it even more heart breaking.

I couldn't find a single weak performance and I'm expecting awards up the arse for this series. Well done Netflix."
7.0,24 September 2022,
8.0,21 September 2022,"This is a mini series chronicling the horrible crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer. Evan Peters is very good playing the title role. No campy stuff here, just plays Dahmer completely convincingly and serious.

Makes effective use of flashbacks to Dahmer's childhood and teen years to explain how he turned out the way he did.

Richard Jenkins plays Dahmer's father. He's great as a man broken by years of unhappiness culminating in realization of what his son has become. Penelope Ann Miller is wonderful in her short role as Dahmer's unstable, UFO-chasing mother.

Niecy Nash has a small role as Dahmer's next-door neighbor. Her scenes are some of the most terrifying and unsettling, not for what you see, but for the sounds she endured. Love her in this role.

The acting is pretty good across the board. The actors playing his victims were perfect at conveying terror. Shaun J. Brown plays Tracy Edwards, a victim, in the first episode. The scene had me on the edge of my seat. Without going into detail, the scene takes place mainly in Dahmer's apartment.

Everything has a very dirty look to it, low lit, hazy. You could almost imagine the ""smell"" of the scenes. As horrible as that sounds, it does make for effectively creepy watching.

Again, the subject matter is very dark and hard to endure. The series takes viewers from Dahmer's childhood up through his trial and imprisonment. I felt like Evan Peters completely inhabited his role. Also left me low with immense sadness for the families of the real-life victims, the survivors of his crimes, and the neighbors and others whose lives are left scarred by the actions of Dahmer the Monster."
7.0,9 October 2022,"This started off as an incredible miniseries that had me on the edge of my seat. The first episode sets the tone perfectly by luring the viewer into the mind of Dahmer through the experience of a victim. Evan Peters does an incredible job at portraying Dahmer, everything down to voice and mannerism is so well-acted it's borderline creepy.

The show manages to portray the gruesome murders without being overly explicit about it, which in a way only adds to the physical discomfort you get from watching it. Instead of seeing blood you instead get to imagine it, which is way more scary. Combined with being beautifully shot and acted, you feel as if you're almost there seeing the real Dahmer himself hunt down and kill his victims.

Unfortunately the show reaches some sort of blind alley from Episode 7 and forth, when the writers start to take too many liberties with the script. Up until that point the show felt very focused, grounded and straight to the point, but then all of a sudden it becomes a political story about discrimination, police incompetence and racial injustice where the writers hijack the story in order to send a message rooted in today's racial climate as of 2022. I mean, I wouldn't mind watching another show about those things but it felt incredibly forced, especially since Dahmer did not discriminate when it came to the color of his victim's skin - he didn't target black people or minorities, but the last four episodes is all about that which kind of ruins everything that came before. And I hate to break it but it's not just that interesting to watch through 1 hour of the victim's families sitting down talking about how miserable they feel. Most people watch these type of shows because they want to see inside the mind of the serial killer himself.

It also doesn't help that a lot of the stuff in the last four episodes is made up, skewed or deliberately pushed aside in order to fit the ""message"" that the writers wanted to shove down our throats. What a shame. This could've easily been a 10/10 show if it wasn't for the fact that Netflix, just like Dahmer himself, just can't help themselves."
9.0,21 September 2022,"I was not sure I wanted to go back to the time of Jeffrey Dahmer however I turned EP 1 on this morning and I could not stop watching it. This series is so very much more than the gruesome reality of Dahmer. It delves into much, much more, equally disturbing facts / truths regarding the parents, victims and the police. In my view, the ugliness of the police is equal to the evil of Dahmer.

A standing ovation to all involved in this production as every aspect is sheer excellence.

Be prepared to binge this whole series in one sitting! It is truly that great.

Thanks to Netflix for producing some of the very best streaming out there!!!"
6.0,4 October 2022,"Well made? Yes. Well acted? Yes, all around. Entertaining? Yes... when it's not over-working itself to be socially woke. What bother me about this series is it tries tooo hard to create storylines that just aren't true. If Murphy wants to delve into true-life crime then he needs to work on not taking such EXCESSIVE liberties, especially when choosing someone who is so well documented.

There are so many inconsistencies to the truth here. I understand peppering a narrative with some extra drama to keep it interesting but this is beyond that to me. By the 7th or so episode it just got to be too much, although I did finish the series. The most compelling episode to me was the episode with Tony. Its a shame more time was not spent on the victims.

I believe real true-crime fans would have preferred a more realistic approach to this story. If you want to embellish I to this extent, create your own serial killer and base him off Dahmer. Oh and stop with the time jumping, in this case it did you zero favors and made very little impact to the story."
1.0,24 September 2024,"I don't understand why Ryan Murphy makes series based on true stories, but embellishes so much. Why not just tell the story truthfully? It's almost as if he doesn't have enough material to produce something of value, so he adds an astonishing amount of falsehoods to the story to make it more lurid. This could have been an excellent telling of events, but instead it is ruined by salacious scenes that are not part of the story. Anyone doing the minimal amount of research will find that this version of the story is not anywhere near the actual truth. I will not watch anything else by Ryan Murphy."
10.0,21 September 2022,"This is disturbing, unsettling and really strange. It's brilliant!

They should do all serial killer series like this. Not leaving any detail out at all. Make the audience actually get a look into the minds and reasons of why and how the killer kills.

Evan Peters is fantastic, he played it so well. I saw him as Jeffrey and not as Evan. Every actor was amazing. I'm so impressed with this series.

I never knew how white privilege the whole situation was with Dahmer. It's cringing and disgusting to see what actually happened during his active years.

Very well done! The team that created this, please do more of other psychopaths like this series."
8.0,20 December 2022,"The way that this was handled was prefect, there was no glorification of the violence that some series allow. This was a story driven decent into his life where no one can feel sorry for him. We see all moments from his younger ages to his worthy death in prison which is only the second murder we actually see play out on screen.

With so many series that center around serial killers the murders are at the forefront just to satisfy a certain audience. Much like Mindhunter and also the fictional Hannibal the story is well written and completely grounded to be true to the victims. There were moments of shouting at the Tv on how did he get away with so much for so long. Which throws so many questions at law enforcement during this time.

The acting performance from Peters is one of these that should be herald as one of the greatest in tv for being so like the real like person but not the way that quite a few people were reacting during the height of the series popularity. Just goes to so some people are weirdly drawn to serial killers.

Overall this is one of the great depictions of a serial killer totally up there with the mindhunter actors!"
8.0,28 September 2024,"Personally, I'm perfectly capable of experiencing a piece of media based on its own merits. In case of media based of or inspired by true events like this one, good chunk of audience is simply too emotional to watch it and review it for what it is - a TV show, project that involved hundreds of people behind and in front of camera, many of them being evidently passionate about their work. Important thing here, this is NOT a documentary, it is NOT an (auto)biography, this will NOT be used as an evidence on the court in any way, shape or form. People who use films and TV shows to form their opinions about real persons or events should probably re-evaluate their mindset in that regard.

That said, this is Ryan Murphy at his best - seamlessly blending camp and melodrama with thrills and plenty of style. It's entertaining as hell but it can also be pretty tough watch. I love the vibrant and poppy visuals that always make these disturbing crime stories even more peculiar considering how those colourful environments radiate sense of comfort and ""fun"".

The performances here are absolutely amazing. Brothers are played by two newcomers, Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander, and they are both ferocious here. I'm sure we will definitely see more from these guys. Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny are also outstanding and these characters weren't something you do on autopilot but they both nailed it.

I enjoyed this a lot. This will probably become the next big thing for Netflix this year and righteously so."
10.0,20 September 2024,"I don't get why all the hate?! In my opinion Ryan Murphy does it again, and did an incredible work right here . I understand that for some there can be a bit too much, and I hope everyone knows we are watching a dramatized show about the case and not a documentary. It's shocking at times (both visually and verbally) but it really makes us question which version we believe and Ryan quickly makes our minds go different places depending on who is telling the story and how both the boys and the parents and everyone around (police, lawyers etc) portrays their pov. I can't wait for season 3! . Give it a chance, amazing acting ."

6.0,28 September 2022,"Dahmer's story has been told many times simply because we are horrified and fascinated by what he did in equal measure. His story is also part of the great debate about nature vs nurture and what has to happen to someone to turn them into a monster. This series started off so well as we delved into this very issue. The first 6 or 7 episodes were compelling but then something happened, as though the director suddenly chickened out. Later victims and Dahmer's experiments with injecting his victims in the brain to create a zombie he could control, were completely ignored. A relationship with one of his victims was invented and an occupant of his apartment block was invented. Then suddenly and for no apparent reason, the whole story stopped being about a serial killer and became all about civil rights with it being suggested that Dahmer's motivation was racist. Dahmer was many things but he was an equal opportunities killer. He chose victims because he found them beautiful and the colour of that person was not his concern. I don't understand why the series suddenly went down this cul-de-sac. Yes, he could have been caught earlier if the police had done their job but that is a different story about institutional racism in the USA and nothing to do with Dahmer, his actions or motivation."
10.0,19 September 2024,"The second season definitely lived up to the high standards set by the first. The performances, particularly from the actors playing the brothers, were incredibly nuanced and compelling, elevating the emotional intensity of the show. Each scene served a purpose, with none feeling out of place, keeping me captivated from start to finish. The storytelling continues to be one of the show's strongest aspects, offering a fresh and insightful perspective on the case. This season deepens the emotional and psychological layers, making it a must-watch for any person. I absolutely loved it, incredible work from every person that worked on the project."
7.0,8 October 2022,"Very well executed with good story and acting. However it would be even better if they didn't have made up part of the story, like the award to the cops, Sandra's arrest and mixing several neighbors into Glenda.

10.0,22 September 2022,"This is so well done and Evan Peters is stellar as Dahmer! He did so well that I am concerned for his mental health after this.

The accuracy and reminder of the absolute dumpster fire the police created made me angry all over again.

Ryan Murphy once again knocks it out of the park with his amazing story telling. I really hope that he, Evan and Neicy are all recognized for their amazing abilities to tell a story.

I feel that framing this one in a mini series format allowed the full and total story to be told in the most thorough way possible. While the subject matter is disgusting, they tell the story as completely, without being gratuitous or overly gruesome, keep in mind it's a serial killing cannibal we're talking about, but it's well done."
10.0,22 September 2022,"The story of one of the most notorious serial killers in the United States, largely told from the points of view of his victims. Being a fan of creepy thrillers and the horror genre I had to binge watch the entire 10 episodes each running 60 minutes. Ryan Murphy scores big on this one and is forgiven for some of his stinkers.

Evan Peters as Dahmer is totally intensely creepy that I had to keep the lights on while watching. It is amazing how he can play any character tranforming himself. Niecy Nash as the concerned nosey neighbor deserves an Emmy for her role. The rest of the cast are superb as well.

Make sure your doors are locked,the lights are on and you order enough food and drinks if you plan to binge watch this as I did."
8.0,28 September 2024,"Both seasons are well made and acted, is impecable television and both stories carried a lot of emotions and are hard to watch, amazing performances by the three leads specially the Melendez brothers actors

There are monsters of course but they are persona with emotional, they have no salvation but is interesting to know about these corrupted souls

These are incredible episodes of television especially season 2 episode 5 and season 1 episode 8

The cast and everyone is great and is a well made television show, the third season is going to be amazing too with Charlie Hunman guys

Overall is worth the while to watch all of this ok."
10.0,3 July 2023,"Evan peters portrays jeffrey dahmer brilliantly in this. If your into true crime you will love this.

Its best to start watching in the afternoon because you want to keep watching it.

All the characters did amazing with this.. Its addictive. Its the best series ive watched in a long time.

We need more glendas because she fought the whole system to make sure the victims got the justice they deserved. She made her voice heard. Nobody else could of played this part like evan peters. He was the perfect person for this role. Im now on american horror story. Thiers nothing evan cant do. He can act and sing."

10.0,22 September 2022,"From the script, cinematography, acting to the casting and costumes this is film making at its best. Binged watched this in one night until 3 am. Captivating and horrifying at the same time. The acting is superb from all involved. The fact it's all true is the worst part about it. Do not believe those 1star and similar reviews and those making quick judgement after watching 1 episode. The story it's self it's so complex you can't possibly make a opinion after watching one episode which is just a tiny piece of puzzle from such a large scale frame of occurrences. I live for documentaries and especially for tibiae which tell past events. This is one of those you'll never forget."
6.0,2 October 2024,"I followed this case closely in the '90s.

Leave it to Ryan Murphy to fill this with inaccuracies and fillers when perhaps two segments would have been fine. Lots of boring scenes.

That being said, the acting is magnificent all around, no even mediocre performances.

Lyle was played by General Hospital alumnus Nick Chavez. Did someone say soap opera actors cannot act? He was fabulous portraying Lyle as an angry, amoral brat with a trigger temper. Cooper Koch's subtle portrayal of Erik was perfect as the kid dominated by his brother and needing his father's love.

Javier Bardem as Jose will scare the hell out of you, and Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne will break your heart.

Though I feel with that hair and overt personality, Leslie Abramson wouldn't be that hard to capture. Amy Gravnor was nevertheless amazing.

Chloe Sevigney captured the pathetic, alcoholic Kitty.

See it for the acting. Read what the real Erik has to say and research the case."
9.0,25 September 2022,"Brilliant. With impeccable production values, a perfect pace, really well written, great direction and editing, it's always full of tension and can instil fear in any of us.

All the different perspectives, all the different stories. We know about Dahmer, of course (one of the greatest performances in history by Evans Peters), but also about his victims, their families, his neighbours (so great Niecy Nash!), his parents (Jenkins...damn!), the awful cops, all the media circus...a great and complete limited series that can be the definitive work about this evil human being.

I understand some of the critics, but I believe the pros - mainly showing this in a scary way to all the new generations and also highlighting the black community as the main victims - are way more important than any kind of sensitivity."
6.0,26 September 2022,"Finished watching this series last night, I will say I did enjoy it even though as some reviewers have said the truth was stretched a bit but of course that doesn't come as a shock because this is a series and they do spread certain scenes out for dramas purposes.

The episodes seems to go fast when you were watching, especially when Evan Peters was on screen as Dahmer, he was brilliant.

I am still at a loss as why some have said they had to turn it off because it was bleak, of course it is. This series is about a serial killer.

Overall a very well done drama series, it's not as gory as your led to believe."
1.0,9 October 2022,
8.0,17 October 2022,"This series was an emotional rollercoaster to watch. The first few episodes really made me uncomfortable. I didn't know most of the details they showed in the series, so it was shocking to see what Dahmer really did throughout his life. My heart goes out to the innocent victims families, it is really disappointing that people have made this series a joke. There should be no jokes made about what Jeffrey did to these young men. It is dehumanizing and disgusting to do so. I am confused as to why they put Glenda Cleveland's apartment right next to Jeffrey's, when that was not where she lived. I don't know why Netflix decided to include false details about the story. Seeing the police bring Konerak stuck with me watching the rest of the series. How clueless can 2 police officers be? He was an innocent child. What's not included in the series like most, Tracy Edwards who escaped Dahmer's apartment and got him arrested, has been in prison multiple times for many reasons including murder. It is interesting how he almost got murdered by Jeff, and then testified against him but later on murdered someone else. Overall, I believe this series was good. Evan and Niecy's performances were outstanding. I don't know why people are fixated on continuing the entertainment of Dahmer's terrible actions, but it was okay. I hope this is the last film/series/documentary they make about the man and focus more on the victims stories. Let them rest in peace."
8.0,14 October 2024,"I knew very little about the Menendez brothers. I knew about the killings and about the molestation defense. But that's about it. The luridness of the story kept me at a distance but now, in this compelling Ryan Murphy series I was hooked from the very first episode. I could watch it as a work of fiction but the fact that it was a true story made me look back and read about it. Oh my God! There are no likeable characters in this saga but really good performances and that's enough to keep you glued to it. And here I discovered Cooper Koch as Erik Menendez. He took over my senses from beginning to end, including the episode that is just him. Superb performance and the humanity he finds in his monster makes you want to rethink the whole thing and believe them/him. He will make re-watch the series again, soon."
8.0,4 October 2022,"So the show is so good actually..but the last three episodes was too focused on glenda cleveland who I wasn't interested about or asking about her...also,her character was so dramatic which I didn't like it and it made me feel like she is pretending in many situations.... I don't know if this because the character is like that in real or it's the actress.thats the only comment for me about what I didn't like in the show but on the other side the show in general was cool...I loved the way of telling the story...I loved the the actors of dahmer and dahmer's dad...I loved photography and directing, which really made me feel like I was in that era."
10.0,1 October 2024,"This was the best show Ive seen in a while: acting, cinematography, music, 80's/ 90's references, even the fact that they included funny moments, that was a blessing and made the heavy subject matter bearable. People are offended but I'm glad Murphy didn't do a boring true crime documentary style show. We had SO many of these about this case for the last 20 years already! Upsetting that this getting reviews bombed from. In France specifically, 3 main outlets gave it astounding reviews. I think this backlash from US reviewers and audience is biased and steams from a puritanism approach. At no point we are told that they are lovers! The shower scene is Dunne telling his version, everybody understood that, and Ep2 shows them being ambiguous - as a way to make the viewer wonder and question trauma bond. I thought that was cleaver. It brought some shakespearian layer, new fresh take on a case I grew up with and honestly was so over hearing about my all life. These awful reviews are a shame but I bet this cinematic masterpiece will become iconic later !"

10.0,14 October 2022,"First i don't understand why people love this series so much & there are A LOT of high ratings, but i'll say it's for Evan's acting.

Thriller series!! While watching this series the episodes were so slow. So i had to speed it & skipping scenes. It was still terrible!!

Second what i didn't like that there's many misrepresentation in this. Like: Glenda wasn't even his neighbor!! She lives in another building so half of those Glenda scenes never happened. And there're more lies that make me seriously wonder if this series is a biography of Jeffrey Dahmer's story!!

I'm not talking about the cast, acting or filming, it was good. The story was really disappointing!! What i found from his scenes & the changes they added was to make people feel empathy for A SERIAL KILLER.. Comments here saying they didn't even take the consent of the victims & their families!! That's why we need to STOP making shows about serial killers and START thinking about the victims."
6.0,2 October 2024,"Difficult viewing but I think it will open people's eyes. I only knew it as ""those brothers that killed their parents for their money"". But that is not true, although they did try to find a solution to their nightmare which allowed them to keep the family fortune. Who were the Monsters? All of them. Parents and Kids. That the appalling sexual and emotional abuse was not properly highlighted during the trial was a miscarriage. They should have served significant time for the violent murders, but the father was the biggest monster of all. I don't think the suggestions of incest between the brothers was justified and was a distraction. I think 30 years in jail is enough though. They should be allowed to appeal the sentences from continuing any longer, and in this age when abuse and its impact is better understood will factor. They should have edited themselves to 5 or 6 episodes - not 9. This must also result in Emmy's for several of the cast."
10.0,23 September 2024,"This is a review for the second instalment of the ""Monsters"" saga - The Lyle and Erik Menendez story.

Much like ""Dahmer"" the show started with a lot of promise - set the scene, created intrigue and gave a good reason to continue watching.

The acting for the most part is phenomenal and the fifth episode in particular was remarkable, especially given the single take.

Unfortunately, however, unlike ""Dahmer"" the show took a pretty swift down turn in the second half. It became lost in never-ending monologues revolving around irrelevant stories that served very little purpose or interest to the audience.

The show was also incredibly frustrating at times - the monologues were tiresome, sure, but it almost felt as if some of the characters and opinions were specifically aimed at getting under your skin. This would be understandable if it was there to provide an altered perspective which provoked a feeling of defensiveness, but what you actually felt was as if you were being nagged at incessantly, provoking pure frustration.

The show was also bloated, which appears to be a relatively common trend these days (cash is king after all), but I felt the joy of the show would have been wrapped up perfectly in a simple 4-5 episodes.

Not a bad show, but nothing to write home about."
7.0,22 September 2022,"I will start by saying this, I watch a lot of true crime. Whether it be 48 hours, or documentaries, biopics, you name it and i've probably watched it. That being said, I have yet to see something as jaw dropping and moving as this series right here. I am pretty numb to the brutality of all of these events because i've read about them or seen them portrayed so many times in different variations of media, so it is very rare for something to actually evoke a sort of emotion out of me.

Evan peters' portrayal of Jeffrey Dahmer is the best I have ever seen. I'm a fan of his work in previous projects (ahs, american animals, x men etc) so going into this I already knew I was in for a treat. But MAN. I genuinely became nauseous at the sight of the vicious acts displayed in this show, Ryan Murphy held back no punches, and I believe the show is better for it. The reality of what this sicko did is just beyond comprehension, and I truly believe that Evan and Ryan and the entire team involved have truly captured that. I am 4 episodes in as of now and am sitting in absolute shock.

This is the first show I have actually had to take a break from, sit back and just let it soak in the true horror of what i'm witnessing. I'm no actor myself so I won't say I know what it takes to play a murderous psychopath like Dahmer, but I can't imagine it's easy. Kudos to the entire production team, Ryan Murphy, and Evan Peters. I will ALWAYS be a fan!"
1.0,17 October 2022,"I have been watching this show and I know almost everything about the Dahmer case, since I enjoy watching true crime shows. I really get confused that they are showing that neighbor lady that is trying to be a hero. That never happened. The only true thing was the complaint about the smell and this actually came from a man and his wife. But they never did anything and for sure never called the police for anything. The show was good until there. It is disappointing that show runners always feel like they have to invent stuff to pump it bigger, by creating a fictional female character that never existed in the real events. Great acting but not accurate. Also when you just watch the interviews with Dahmer that exist on YouTube, you'll see that he is not talking the way he is portrayed. But it is in general still better as I expected, since I find it weird anyway to make films and shows about such horrific things. And since there are plenty of docs about that I would've expected more explicit visualizations of the crimes. What's the point to not do so ? If it's all already out there."
10.0,25 September 2024,"If you like watching movies inspired by true events that are accurate then this movie isn't for you. It's Hollywood trash. I refused to keep watching because of how grossly inaccurate it was. Watch the real footage from the trial, or wait for a better documentary to come out.

There was no humanity or authenticity in the way the actors were behaving. Especially when you compare them to the real Mend brothers. I feel like supporting this movie and whoever made this is unethical. These men were victims and perpetrators and that concept is so complex and should be handled better.

Don't watch it. Wait for the next documentary or movie/show to come out."
10.0,21 September 2024,"""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" on Netflix.

I couldn't watch the Dahmer series that precedes this one. I did watch this. I had zero recollection of the brothers, this crime and all the followed.

I have to say that as I stumbled through this it started to occur to me that everyone is a monster in one way or another. The parents. The two brothers. The therapist. The lawyers. There's not a single likable character. They are all terrible people.

It is relentlessly violent and gruesome.

It's not ""clever"" (as is Wyatt Earp and the Cowboy Wars), and has no humor. It is just relentless. It is disturbing and unpleasant. It's awful.

Numerous times I thought I should stop watching it, and yet... I persisted. It's crazy but I did so even though I did not really like it.

There is what I think is very good acting. One episode is just Eric and his lawyer, with the latter's back to the camera. It feels like it was filmed in one take and it is incredible. The actor playing Eric is crazy good.

I don't know if I recommend this. It goes way beyond True Crime. I think it might be good filmmaking though. It reminds me a bit of The Bear in that the episodes are very distinct with a specific topic or subject.

I give this a seven. It's well done, and as I said the acting is superb."
10.0,28 September 2024,"Bored at first, I turned it off a quarter of the way through episode 1, but then I read some reviews, and decided to turn it back on. And soo glad I did! It's GOOD!!! Yes, some parts drag, and it could have been easily done in 6 episodes, but it's worth it!

The last two episodes 8 and 9 are magnificent. Hang in there! Watch it.

Such a horrific crime, these boys couldn't catch a break, much of their doing.

Let's face it, they probably wouldn't have survived in the real world.

The plot thickens!! The SA being hearsay, UNTIL NOW! One of the boys from Menudo has come out recently and said Jose Menedez drugged him and SA him. Documentary is on Peacock, check it out!"

7.0,24 September 2024,"*Monsters: The Menendez Brothers* delves deeply into the haunting psychology of trauma and its ability to warp the human soul. The line, ""Maybe we are sociopaths, but can you blame us if we are, when you know what's been happening to us?"" captures the raw, desperate plea for understanding in the face of unspeakable horrors. It's a chilling reflection on how deeply pain and abuse can fracture a person's moral compass. The series challenges viewers to wrestle with the uncomfortable truth: are we all accountable for our sins when our memories of trauma imprison us, distorting reality and morality? This show refuses to let us look away from the darkness that trauma can create, urging us to question the very nature of guilt and redemption."

And also documentary coming next month it's really a big day for Dahmer lol.

6.0,29 September 2022,"Essentially this series has two ""parts"" -a retelling of the well known horror (which is what you would expect) and harrowing tales of those that lived on, which isn't something that we usually see in detail. First part leaves you in fear and shock while the second makes you numb

1) The ""what happened"" montage So acting is top notch but I have the problem with overall tone of episodes. Firstly - it is too slow, movements, dialogues, music, zoom ins and outs. The creepy atmosphere is exaggerated. The scary part isn't titular monster being a walking red flag and staring at you, it's the fact that you don't know it's a monster until it's too late. Subtlety would've made this 10/10 since we know how this is gonna play out, we don't need every possible visual or musical cue to be on the edge. Would've preferred the chronological order of events

2) The story of survivors is what made this exceptional and something I honestly didn't expect. Somehow it felt like I was there, alive at that time and place, staring in shock and dissappointment at the world until there was nothing. This would've been a great opportunity to collaborate with the families, to be their voice, to inspire people to do better but none of that happened. They apparently weren't consulted at all. Ironically, Netflix did the same thing people in charge did back then and completely ignored them making way for their own project. It poses a question - how ethical is the true crime genre if all we're doing is satisfying our own curiosity and making profits of destroyed lives? There always needs to be a reminder that this is real life and not entertainment

As a mini series this gets 9/10, props to the actors, cons to extremely slow pace. Netflix gets 1/10, a silver lining being them not making titular monster into a sensation. Combine that however you will."
9.0,10 October 2024,"The second season is not trying to make friends (this rating is for season 2 only). It is actually a movie that will infuriate anyone who takes a side on the case before watching. It will infuriate those who believe the Menendez brothers were justified to kill their parents.and those who supported their defence and believe their sentences should've been reflected by their plausible sexual abuse story and those who believe they killed strictly for an inheritance.

This was a difficult story to tell because (a) the subject matter is/was intensely sensitive and (b) the Menendez brothers motive is still being hotly debated today.

You don't have to pick a side. Nathan Lane (playing Dominick Dunne) and the screenplay can lead you either way (Lane, BTW, was brilliant in this). What I do extricate from this film, like 12 Angry Men, is how complicated justice can become even when several people agree on the same sequence of events.."
7.0,22 October 2022,"If you actually know the full, true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, much of this show is infuriating. It is riddled with inaccuracies and over dramatization. However, it's wise to keep in mind that this isn't a documentary on Dahmer, it's a TV show, so excess and ridiculous drama is expected. The show overall is pretty good, but surprisingly SO slow. Each episode lasted an eternity and was wayyyy too drawn out. I understand this is how shows make their money, but it's rough as a viewer. I was also expecting much more gore and violence. There's next to none. Almost all graphic content is described by other people in the episodes, not actually seen. I really dislike how the show is pieced together as well. The first episode starts with Dahmer being arrested, and we backtrack from there, spring forward, backtrack, spring forward, etc. It seems like a really strange way to tell a story like this. It makes it more confusing than it already is. The timeline they actually lay out for Dahmer's life is wack. Finally, the involvement of basically everyone involved is super exaggerated, but this is how they make the story more compelling I guess. They also make this story 1000x more racially charged than it actually was. However, I was definitely expecting that. My biggest piece of advice before watching Dahmer is to do your research. There's a short documentary on Peacock called ""Dahmer on Dahmer"" that I highly recommend watching FIRST. Even simply reading Jeffrey Dahmer's Wikipedia was incredibly informative and it gives you a knowledge base for this show. The show itself is decently entertaining, but all viewers should keep in mind that this portrayal is not at all accurate. The ratio of accuracies to inaccuracies are 1:10, seriously. It's almost like the writers took the story of Dahmer as a template and made up 5 other storylines and mashed them all together to make a show that is kinda about Dahmer, but really not. It's so weird and annoying.

I'm giving this show a six because the acting is top tier, especially by Evan Peters. He absolutely nailed the character of Jeffrey Dahmer. Unbelievable acting all around."

10.0,12 October 2022,"First of all, Evan Peters is an amazing actor, and if his character wasn't based on a real person this would have been phenomenal. However, I feel the creators did a great injustice by the way they portrayed Dharmer. It comes off as if he was some insecure, sombre, loner when in reality he was a manipulative, confident and calculating sociopath.

It's as if the creators almost want to depict Jeffery Dhamer as being a misunderstood outcast who can't bare to be alone, but the reality was that Dhamer lacked any kind of remorse or empathy for his victims and treated human beings like objects to satisfy his grotesque desires. The real kicker, however, is that the creators didn't even bother to contact a single family member of any victim, re-traumatising them in this process. For a show that claims to 'strive to put the victims' stories and their families' trauma at the heart of the production' they sure have a funny way of showing it. Jeffrey Dhamer is not a brand, he doesn't deserve a narrative.

If maybe the creators took inspiration from Dhamer's life instead of trying to retell the story in a way that made Dhamer some kind of victim himself, this would have made for a much better series."
10.0,13 October 2022,"All of the actors in this series did a great job, specifically Peters who portrayed Dahmer. But that's the only reason to why I give this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.

I've watched lots of true crime, but this series was something else. Netflix has taken a real life event - peoples real trauma (let me remind you that this did not happen thaaat long ago either) - and made it into a tv-show mixed with fictional events. What makes this different from lots of other true crime that I've seen is that they have real actors (who dresses the same as the real victims and of course are named the same thing as them) who they've used to recreate the scenes of the murderers. If you don't find any issues with this ethically yet, please have in mind that lots of the murderers that are shown in this series have made up stuff thrown in to the scenes which never has never happened just to make it more interesting for the viewer. For example the episode that focused on the very sweet deaf guy that unfortunately met paths with Dahmer, that was not at all how his last day looked like. What make this even more ethically wrong, is that Netflix did not even ask or inform the families of the victims first.

It's awful how hard Netflix are trying to capitalize on so many completely innocent young mens deaths. This series never should have been made. I feel genuinely sorry for the victims families about having to relive this again, I never would have watched it through if I knew everything I've learned from googling the case now after I've seen it."
8.0,21 October 2022,"I found Dahmer difficult to watch, and it's pace is methodical and sometimes daunting, but it is effective in creating a dark and gloomy atmosphere. I personally found Evan Peters' performance good but annoying. I am not familiar with Dahmer's true voice and mannerisms and I would assume Peters studied them. If so, Dahmers himself had some very annoying voice and accent ticks, and perhaps Peters is just doing the best he can. Niecy Nash's performance as Dahmer's persistent neighbour is stellar. She deserves a SAG or an Emmy for her amazing portrayal. Her scene with Jesse Jackson is particularly poignant and impactful.

Ryan Murphy's take on the life of Dahmer May not be everybody's cup of tea, but such a topic unfortunately cannot be glossed over."

10.0,2 October 2024,"Another brilliant Ryan Murphy production . This is my first comment cause I loved this show. It feels i didnt see the same show as other critics . From what i read , they did not reach episode 5 . I feel the show shows all the sides of the characters, and episode 5 is just so well played... amazing job by actors . This show is rich and indeed can be stereotyped at the beginning but gets better and better with episodes. Things I loved in this show is: amazing acting , filming , music and showing of ""both sides"" -- and letting the audience decide who the monsters are in this tragedy. Totally recommend."
7.0,27 November 2022,"Evans Peter does a masterful job of portraying Jeffrey Dahmer. I was in my 20's when this story broke. Obviously, it did make national news, but not like it would today with the internet & social media. After watching this series, I still cannot believe this actually happened, but know it did. My heart breaks all over again for these families. I saw in some reviews that people took exception to the light being shown on the police force at that time. But, I think it was needed & deserved. I totally respect the police & I am extremely appreciative of the difficult job they do. However, there are bad apples...and it is no secret that there are underserved communities. Jeffrey Dahmer could & should have been stopped sooner. I read that some of the families feel victimized all over again. While I feel I can somewhat understand that feeling, I'm hoping something can be learned from this so this never happens again. Probably wishful thinking on my part though."
9.0,25 September 2022,"I didn't want going to watch it at first. After all it is a disgusting and disturbing story, to say the least.

I can say it was mostly done with a modicum of decency. The gore and violence was kept to a minimum.

It was a decenct show until episode 7. Then it became an excuse for people not involved to claim victimhood. The best segment was the background of the sweet young promising deaf man. I really was hoping this would be more like the Versace segment of ACS and focus on the victims.

The police are damned if they do and damned if they don't, aren't they? If they'd have stuck their nose in too far they'd have been accused of harassing people based on race or sexual orientation. They are easy to blame instead of those committing carnage. I think most people in that particular building minded their own troubles and didn't want the law around. The police were told to lay off the gay community. Also, some say Gacywas racist because he only killed white guys.

The acting was good. It was overlong though. It takes a stab at trying to make sense of how Dahmer became a monster. I don't think anyone will ever know. It did show Dahmer as a soulless automaton. Seems pretty accurate. I think this is why he couldn't hold anyone's attention and the reason he had no feeling for other humans. Some reviewers don't believe his personality could have attracted all those men. It didn't. It was the fact he was blonde. A status symbol. A trophy hookup.

At least they didn't show scenes of vulnerable people suffering and begging for their lives."
7.0,29 September 2024,"""Monsters"" continues Ryan Murphy's anthology series with another true crime story I was pretty unfamiliar with. I understand the series has faced controversy for its portrayal of the real characters and events, but I am not here to comment on its accuracy. As a series, I think it is pretty solid. The actors do a phenomenal job and the story is mostly engaging. I feel it is a bit of a drag sometimes being 9 episodes but it explores a lot of ideas and kept my interest, and I think it is justified this is a TV series over a movie. The show is often really sad and heavy but also perplexing as it never really is clear about what is truly going on. Overall, I think it is a solid addition to the Murphy crime series library and maybe it's not the best for a lot of you, but for me it's decent, it is engaging, often intense, and definitely memorable."
4.0,25 September 2022,
10.0,24 September 2022,"Although brutally graphic, this is probably the most accurate and comprehensive tv series/ movie ever produced about Jeffrey Dahmer. Outstanding performances from all the actors but particularly Niecy Nash as the passionate Glenda Cleveland who delivered an amazing performance as Dahmer's neighbour. An horrific story of this man's abhorent crimes that will leave you numb, especially watching all episodes in one sitting. The set decorators and costume designers did a great job of accurately representing the time periods the series is set in. Certainly not for children to watch or the faint hearted."
10.0,26 October 2022,"Let's get this out of the way first; Evan Peters is nothing short of phenomenonal in the title role. His immersion in the character is evident and the layers to his performance are superb. If you also need any reminder (not that anyone should need it) that Richard Jenkins is one of the most versatile actors on screen today, your proof is here.

My issue, however, is in the tempo and creative licence taken by the writers. Very similar to what happened in The Watcher, the very long, very drawn-out story simply doesn't follow a lot of the well-publicised timelines and movements of Dahmer, and instead paints him more as an unwilling participant in compulsive acts rather than the predatorial individual he was.

Murphy's writing style obviously strikes a cord with many, but it's not without its frustrations."
9.0,1 October 2022,"The first several episodes were pretty good. The last few after his capture felt very rushed and biased with Jeffrey not depicted accurately at all. It was like they got tired and dropped the ball. Watch all the interviews of Dahmer on YouTube and you'll see how they depicted him in prison in the series is nothing like how he really was then. They kept trying to portray him as evil and sleazy even though he was not and was repentant (he was found not to be a psychopath when tested, and even his doctors were genuinely sad to hear of his passing). As a psychology student, Dahmer has always fascinated me for the uniqueness of his psychology and how he wasn't truly evil like other serial killers, just incredibly sick.

The thing that made me want to turn the show off was how they just had to stick in the rumor of Jeff taunting prisoners with food. That is completely untrue, it was a statement made by Scarver (his killer) when he was trying to get a book deal. Originally Scarver had said God told him to kill those inmates, and he also killed someone else at the same time. It had nothing to do with taunting. Also, according to Patrick Kennedy, Jeffrey had been in isolation for his own protection the entirety of his sentence until he finally asked to be released into general population even though he said he knew he would probably be killed there. And at least one officer who worked at the prison said Jeffrey was a model inmate on his way to medium security for good behavior. Inaccuracies like this are predictable but irritating. But I guess the drama and rumors are what make for better television."
9.0,21 September 2022,"I have been waiting to watch this for some time now and I am not disappointed! Evan Peters portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer is a masterpiece.

Right from the beginning I was hooked & throughout, it was very accurate to the real facts behind the horrific story of Dahmer.

All the actors starring in this were fantastic, great selection.

Usually with serial killer programmes/series they're not good, they feel very fake but this was not.

Ryan Murphy needs to do more series on serial killers as he very talented and can portray their lives in a way that keeps the viewer hooked. I can not wait to see what else he brings out.

Definitely worth a watch."
7.0,24 September 2024,"Oh boy another version of the Menendez story...so I thought. From the get go you're in, they reel you in and you're alllll the way in. Brilliant writing, music, acting, everything...this production knows how to make a series. I only write reviews for excellent productions just to make sure they know how much I appreciate their hard work because it's not easy to hit home runs in Hollywood but this one is without a doubt A+ work. Congratulations!!! The gentleman who played Lyle should win an award...perfection. You get both sides of the story, all angles, all views and it makes you think. It's a dark world and those boys took action. How to punish them takes some thought."
8.0,4 January 2023,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" from creator Ryan Murphy et al. Is as much an in-depth psychological examination of the prolific serial killer - his upbringing, his relationships, his desires and behaviors - as it is a graphic, unsparing, intimate, highly tense, and disturbing Netflix series. I feel disgusted, disturbed, intrigued, fascinated, and invested all at the same time. Much of the show's success is due to engrossing performances, particularly by Evan Peters in a disquieting turn as Jeff Dahmer and Richard Jenkins as his hard-ass father Lionel. Layer upon layer, the confounding character study unfolds by taking the viewer to different time periods in non-linear fashion throughout Jeff's life, setting the stage with his capture and interrogation. I only wish the pacing was a little faster sometimes, but the slow burn often increases the anxiety through anticipation and dread. The show also looks great capturing a retro and seedy atmosphere and the details of several locales from the 70s through the 90s. If you're fascinated by serial killer studies, then this is a must-watch, but if you are squeamish, then look away. Crazy fact: That's Molly Ringwold of ""Pretty in Pink"" fame as Shari Dahmer."
7.0,16 October 2022,"This series looks at the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer, his early years, failed jobs, crimes and victims.

I worried early on that it was going to feel long, or stretched out, ten episodes is quite stretch, it wasn't, at no point was this slow or underdeveloped.

An incredibly chilling watch, it doesn't hold back, it puts you very close to the action, physically and mentally, you'll be left with strong options of Dahmer, and his hideous crimes.

You'll get an idea as to why Dahmer chose the victims that he did, and you'll have an idea as to why he got away with things for so long.

It doesn't follow a straight line, it moves backwards and forwards through Dahmer's life as it progresses, but it does make sense, and it really is cohesive.

Best episode for me was Tony's story, he was the most developed of the victims, you felt his dreams, ambitions and hopes, only to see them dashed by Dahmer.

Great cast, superb acting, it truly is a PowerPoint performance from Evan Peters, he's phenomenal.

9/10."
10.0,3 October 2022,
7.0,10 January 2023,"This is one of the most difficult reviews I've written. To start off I'd have to give credit where it is due. It was a very well produced series with excellent performances, but at the same time I was conflicted watching it. Even before they exposed the sick people who became fans of him in the later episodes I wondered why I was watching this to begin. There's something wrong with giving all of this fame and glory to this evil lunatic. Unlike many others I've read in the reviews I didn't feel sympathy for him for one second. There are many individuals in this world with sick fantasies and poor upbringings who don't go on to do what he did.

On the other hand I do think it is valuable to learn the history of these types of events as the show particularly did a good job highlighting the systemic flaws that allowed this flame to become a blazing forest fire. I did check the truth behind much of the series and it does do a good job in this respect as well.

Overall, of any series I've ever watched this is definitely one that I couldn't and would never watch again. I learned stuff I didn't know which was valuable , but I hate that these kinds of people live on infamy through productions like this."
2.0,22 September 2022,"Holy moly this was intense, creepy, disturbing and terrifying from the start to the finish. Based of course on the true Jeffery Dahmer case of kidnapping, murder and cannibalism.

Evan does a very convincing and disturbing job playing Jeffery Dahmer. His looks and demeanor, the way he talks and even moves is just disturbing. Absolutely convincing and all around terrific job playing this role. Absolutely stunning performance.

The writing and production are top notch and professional and even the simple music is haunting and matches the story and scenes.

The rest of the cast is very competent and talented and play their roles very well. But Niecy Nash steals the spot for best female performance. Brilliant and emotional.

All around I would say watch it."
9.0,25 September 2024,"Monsters: The Eric and Lyle Menendez Story delivers a chilling and captivating portrayal of one of the most infamous criminal cases in American history. The show masterfully explores the complex layers of truth surrounding the Menendez brothers' trial, blurring the lines between what the media depicted, what the public was led to believe, and the deeper psychological nuances of what may have ""really"" happened behind closed doors.

The performances are nothing short of gripping. The actors portraying Eric and Lyle Menendez capture the vulnerability, confusion, and darkness of their characters with haunting accuracy. The way the show navigates the conflicting narratives-the media's sensationalized portrayal of the brothers as cold-blooded murderers, their own defense of long-term abuse, and the stark societal judgment-creates an unsettling atmosphere that leaves viewers questioning who the real monsters are.

What stands out in Monsters is its ability to weave together the cold facts of the case with the emotional and moral undertones. It challenges viewers to reflect on the themes of family trauma, the impact of public perception, and the lengths to which people will go to conceal the ugly truths of their lives.

The direction and pacing are solid, ensuring that even those familiar with the case remain engaged and invested in the unfolding drama. The show doesn't shy away from the raw, uncomfortable truths at the core of the story, while also leaving room for the audience to question their own judgments and assumptions. This isn't supposed to be an easy watch. You're not supposed to condone what they did, but understand why and what mindset they were in.

In the end, Monsters is more than just a retelling of the Menendez brothers' story. It's an examination of truth itself-what is presented, what is hidden, and the murky space that exists in between."
10.0,24 November 2022,"This was a very dark, interesting look into Jeffrey Dahmer, his family and upbringing and his awful crimes. Unfortunately, they felt the need to fudge some facts and even blantantly make up some stuff and turn it into the Glenda Cleveland show.

It's almost as if they brought Niecy Nash on and felt like making her a major focus of the series. I found myself extremely annoyed every time she appeared on screen because I have to watch her overacting and hear your obnoxious voice. It really ruined the second half of this show.

I wish they would've just stuck with the real story because it was compelling enough without having to make stuff up. Overall, it's still a good show."
10.0,25 September 2024,"I can't say I'm surprised, just disappointed. It's just sad that we have to use theories and false info to carry a show. For people watching this, if they don't do their research (or have done it beforehand) then they'll be led down a path that the brothers were lying (which I'm already seeing so many state all over social media). But thankfully, people will actually research the subject and learn the facts, to see the truth and lies of the series, which is what I'm hoping happens.

Don't get me wrong, the acting was PHENOMENAL. But the direction that Ryan took the show in is unfortunate. This could've been a great way to educate new generations, instead, majority of it is from the perspective of others, instead of solely on the boys."
9.0,22 September 2022,"Wow. Evan Peters is an amazing actor. I've been keeping up with him since AHS. He's so diverse and talented.

This story is so...sad. I've read about Dahmer and the way people dealt with mental health back then is frustrating and completely infuriating. Most people that knew him knew something wasn't right. I know his dad tried...a little. But I wish more was done to keep him behind bars or in a mental institution.

Seeing his victims from their point of view was the hardest part of this entire series. Excruciatingly heartbreaking.

I wish shows/movies would show more of this. Yes, we're all intrigued with how someone could be so incredibly messed up. I personally want to see the psychology behind it. There's always a reason.

But we need more focus on the victims, who they were and how it tore up their families up... Forever.

Maybe it'll help others to see the signs and help to stop the person from doing awful things.

All in all, this series was amazing.

Props to Netflix for doing it right."
6.0,26 September 2022,"I have always liked Evan, but this is a whole other level (I know a cliché). He goes from tenderness to monstrous in a heartbeat. The supporting cast is outstanding too. This is one of those really tough viewing series that keeps you gripped and you can't look away. The only other series that was like this in recent memory, was Chernobyl. That feeling of dread in the pit of your stomach. It's not even the same genre but that gripping horror is the same. The one thing that the Dahmer series dies, is keep the directly gruesome images out, it's mostly indirect but you know exactly what you're (not) looking at."
10.0,20 September 2024,
6.0,23 September 2022,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't know anything about the Dahmer story before watching this but wow is this quite terrifying to watch and realise this is all true.

Evan Peters gives an Emmy winning performance as the psychotic serial killer that is truly disturbing and terrifying and after reading up about Dahmer after watching the show, he really does capture the look and characteristics of him.

The supporting cast truly do a great job (Dahmer's parents especially) as well in bringing this whole murderous event to life.

I would recommend for people who are fans of shows based on true events and who just love Evan Peters work."
8.0,2 October 2022,"This series really highlights the brilliance that Mindhunter managed to achieve with its tone and approach to the fascination that serial killer cases evoke.

What MH got right, with its perfect mix of realism, fictional embezzlement, and respectful absence of victim voyeurism, is what Dahmer - Monster: The JD Story (what a title, eh?) gets absolutely wrong.

By centering the argument on Dahmer, dramatizing his upbringing and family members, by revisiting the interactions of the victims with him, the show becomes disrespectful to their families and tone-deaf to the cruel power of its inspiration as well as just plain uninteresting, dragged out, and unfocused. The shifts in timeline and order of the episodes are chaotic, seemingly pointless.

The directing, acting and post-production are at an amazing level, though, hence the 6-star rate."
6.0,22 September 2022,"What a brillant and mesmerizing while terrifying series ! Evan peters did again. Just give him already the emmy for best actor in limited series .

For me , him and jeremy strong are the best actors in this new generation!

Watched it all in one day . Kudos also to ryan murphy , he delivered again ! I think after this show , there no need to depict the Dahmer again . He was portrayed perfectly . And i like the way it also focused on the homophobia and racism at that time , and the disdain from the police towards those group minorities.

Finally Netflix gave us a good series to watch because it's been a while that they did."
8.0,27 September 2022,"First things first: Evan Peters is great. Which isn't surprising, especially for those who watched American Horror Story. He deserves an award for this interpretation of Dahmer, as far as I'm concerned.

But everything else is just... Boring. It's not supposed to be gore or visceral, but Netflix's approach is a little bit too soft for this kind of story. Not only that, it lacks historical accuracy. By ""saving"" viewers from certain details of Dahmer's crimes, people who didn't know the story beforehand might still be unaware of the full extent of his madness, by the end of this series, and yes, that fact contributes to the feeling of empathy that many of the viewers might develop for him, throughout the story.

I'm being purposely vague, so I don't spoil anything, but in the end, I'm very disappointed, the 6 out of 10 is just because I loved E. P's performance, nothing else."
9.0,3 November 2022,"This was truly an amazing piece of TV. Initially the first few episodes are alittle slow, but then the direction and filming of it takes a great turn. The main focal actors deserve awards for their show and what they brought to it. Shows like this always.make me feel for how it must be for the families to relive this, and most are surely angry when it's for TV viewing. I fully understand that but I think these shows do cast light on the terrible things that happened before our time and allow us to praise and show love for the deceased. I honestly hope the families move on and have been able to have great.lives after this."
10.0,21 January 2023,"There are excellent performances by the lead actors - Evan Peters as Jeff, Richard Jenkins as his father Lionel and last but not least Niecy Nash as his neighbour Glenda. Khetphet Phagnasay as one of the victims fathers was also very good. The rest of the cast were adequate.

If you're old enough the story is well known and here was dealt with in an interesting way. It starts with Dahmer's arrest and then is told in a series of flash backs and forward to some of the events in the story, some covered more than once from slightly different points of view. While I quite liked this some people may find it a little confusing.

Where the series looses points for me is that there is too much padding and repetition in many of the episodes making them drag. The series could have been cut down to 5 or 6 one hour episodes without loosing the story and it's impact and would have been far better.

5 out of the 6 points I rated it are for the lead actors performances especially Evan Peters."
9.0,6 April 2023,"I'm a fan of Ryan Murphy as his works are real and dig raw and it feels like madness, as he shows the grit and dirty like happenings of raw real life stories so well(evidenced by ""American Crime Story"", ""Impeachment"", ""American Horror Story"", and ""Feud"": Beatty and Joan""). So with this special ""Netflix"" limited series ""Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" it was raw, blunt, and brash in it's showcase of one crazy real life monster in serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer(the wicked and good Evan Peters). The murder scenes are brutal and very blood like with nightmarish gore. Still along the way aside from the horror this series goes in depth and in detail about Jeff's troubled life and upbringing that lead him to be a monster, as shown are his being from a broken home, and his early love for road kill, which would all shape his different lifestyle on the Milwaukee streets which involved encounters at bars and bathhouses, after his exile from Ohio, and the military after his bored south Florida stay, in which Jeff passed some time working, staying with grandma, drinking beer and orange crush soda aside from his other strange hobbies. It's like a real life like bio of a serial killer, and you the viewer feel the pain of the victims families, and Jeff's father Lionel(the good Richard Jenkins) suffers the sorrow and heartbreak of what his grown son Jeffrey has become. Overall this was a tough brash series that grips your interest while you witness the difference of one Jeffrey and all while feeling the pain of the victims and their families."
7.0,16 December 2022,
8.0,17 February 2023,"This show is just outstanding, so far I've seen this three times this week.

This is how good it is the acting, direction, editing, casting, cinematography everything is mind-blowing Each and every actor deserves appreciation yes each every actor because of all of them were just pitch perfect especially peters, no joke I've seen this kind of acting after a long long time, he was ridiculously good, he nailed this role(not exaggerating he actually did) this is probably the only show that actually feels like set in 70s, 80s and 90s which is good thing for sure.

Now I've given you a pretty good idea how awesome this show is, the story is based on real events but bits and pieces are still fictional, not to violate the true events too much, the gruesomeness, sexual scenes, violence is shown in a moderate way which a good thing, the makers didn't rely on these factors but a good story and a team of good actors giving their best performances..

Now whatever I've said above has nothing to do with the real life events or people at all, i only talked about how great the ""show"" is I do understand how heartbreaking and terrifying it must've been for the victims and their families, my prayers goes to them, god bless them they sure did not deserve to leave the world like that, Jeffrey dahmer was a horrible and messed up human being who didn't deserve to live, and people who are going to sympathize with him after the show, no you don't...it's Evan peters who did a great job with his acting, give him the credit for that.. This show does not glorify that killer or the pain he caused to the victims and families, it is only a cinematic piece of art, this show clearly showcases dahmer as the ""Antagonist"" and victims and their families as ""protagonist"" this why I liked this very much.. And i believe you will too.."
6.0,26 September 2024,"I'm starting to love Netflix's high octane mix of genres. They can do stuff that network TV can't/won't do. The monsters series is another great watch IMO.

The cast is great and the cinematography is on point. I started watching this as something to have on in the background but quickly got hooked. It can be slow in parts but quickly ramps up with some comedy and a gripping change in mood. This coupled with an all star cast makes this series a must watch. It starts with a graphic murder scene and carries on with eccentric characters with bizarre motivations. It also seems very authentic to the time period."
9.0,7 November 2022,"The first few episodes were good and I really wanted to know what would happen next. In my opinion, the series was then unnecessarily drawn out. It would have made more sense to make it a mini-series.

However, special praise goes to Evan Peters, for me the successor to Leonardo DiCaprio. Fantastic acting! I hope for his sake that he will no longer be seen only in streaming series, but will also make it into feature films. He has what it takes!

It's fun to see Evan Peters in the role of the serial killer, and the creators have more than nailed his look as well.

The racist view of the police, who don't take the black neighbor seriously, as well as the relatives of the victims, because they were mainly black, Asian or Hispanic, is well portrayed."
7.0,27 November 2022,"Evan Peters did a tremendous job. A dark show, yes, but it was very interesting. Quite sad actually, both on the victims end and what their families had to go through. I would never sympathize with Jeffrey, but just imagine in a real world scenario that there was someone you knew, who's life took a turning point, that you can intervene and help them. But sometimes it's safer to stay on your side of the fence and mind your business, and that's the aggression this show captured. Sympathy for the victims, also fear and remorse. From beginning to end, it was a slow burn at first, but pretty good.."
9.0,23 October 2022,"Not enough praise can be heaped on the leading cast. Evan Peters gives an unsettling and nuanced performance, and Richard Jenkins blows it out of the water as a horrified yet still devoted father. I could go on for paragraphs about the strength of the main characters in this show, in both portrayal and script. Although some of the victims' families take offense to this show existing, it is unfortunately part of the territory when you're attached to shocking events, and I felt this show was more respectful than most serial killer fare. Never does it stoop to exploitation or cheap shocks (many of the more gruesome details of Dahmer's crimes are omitted), and care is taken to portray the victims as real people with lives and families. Dahmer himself is not one-dimensional, but neither is he really sympathetic. The show avoids trying to explain why he is the way he is, which I really appreciated.

It is to be expected that liberties will be taken with these real events to condense things, provide better pacing, etc. Most of the changes I thought were fine. Where things began to kind of go off the rails was around episode 6 or 7. After Dahmer's arrest, the show begins to focus heavily on the court proceedings, race relations, and the domestic drama of the grieving families, the latter two delving into straight fiction. At the risk of sounding callous, I found it boring. I don't care that a victim's mother took umbrage at a tasteless comic starring Dahmer and mounted a lawsuit. Dahmer was a killer of opportunity and did not go out of his way to kill minorities, nor did he specifically choose a minority neighborhood to live in. The police did not ignore tips/warning signs about Dahmer because the neighborhood was mostly black, but because of homophobia (an actual issue the show could have explored more). I do not believe cops were making racist crank calls to victims' families, and the man who killed Dahmer was a raving lunatic who murdered someone for $15, not the righteous hand of justice.

Would have been an 8/10 or 9/10 without the drop in accuracy and quality post-episode 7. Still worth a watch if you enjoy this sort of thing."
10.0,21 September 2022,
10.0,22 October 2022,"First off, I am an Evan Peters fan. I think he's a terrific actor but I don't really feel like his portrayal of Dahmer was all that great. One of the scariest things about Dahmer was how intelligently and articulately he described his own crimes. The real Dahmer was soft-spoken, but self-aware and charismatic enough to manipulate people but Evan Peters portrayed him as completely monotone and emotionally flatlined. Maybe that's what people expect of someone who's done these kinds of crimes, but it wasn't how he actually was. There are many online interviews where you can see for yourself. I'm sure it was a difficult role, but I feel like EP missed the mark and just played him as a generically non-emotive psycho.

There are also a lot of inaccuracies; many other reviewers have listed them here so I won't bother repeating, but there was a definite narrative being presented that diverged from facts. The real story was intriguing and certainly horrifying enough to not have to make stuff up or editorialize it to a particular opinion, but that's Hollywood for you.

All in all it was worth a watch, especially the first half where the inaccuracies were kept to the minimum and the history of JD's life is presented as events actually unfolded. There's a lot of time jumps that could be confusing if you aren't familiar with his story but that didn't really ruin it for me. What did ruin it were the later episodes where entire episodes are based on fabricated characters and events that are used to ""sell"" a particular narrative. Still it's the best and most detailed look at Dahmer and the horrible, shocking crimes he committed."
10.0,24 September 2024,"...but it's not a documentary. Murphy relied a lot on Erik's narrative in A&E's THE MENENDEZ MURDERS: ERIK TELLS ALL, because right after I finished Monsters, I rewatched it. I was actually surprised at how much Murphy took from what Erik said in that documentary. I have to give him props for that. He got a lot right, relying a little on Robert Rand's prolific knowledge of the case and people. Where he had to be totally fictitious, IMO, was in the conversations between Kitty and Jose; scenes where it would be impossible to know what was said, because no one else was there. And since The Boys weren't consulted at all for this (I'm sure they wanted nothing to do with it, and who can blame them?), probably their private conversations too. I also would like to know why the maid wasn't a part of the series at all. Maybe because she testified in the 2nd trial she never heard fighting or shouting? (Liar, again IMO).

I'm a huge fan of Ryan Murphy, but this series took me a few episodes to warm up to. However, I was sobbing at the end. I gave this series a 9, because no other movie/series, even the Law & Order one, which was great, depicted for me the deep bond Lyle and Erik had, and still have. I was extremely emotionally affected by that aspect of Monsters; it was visceral. I have always believed Lyle and Erik, mostly BECAUSE of that bond they share. Deep emotional and physical trauma, especially shared by siblings, will either estrange them, or bond them together so tightly nothing can break it.

The end of episode 6, where they pull up in the car with the shotguns while the last verse of Crowded House's DON'T DREAM ITS OVER plays, was a really surreal moment for me. In that moment, when they exited the car and walked into the house ... I don't know, it was like, for a split second, I was there with them, not the fictional Lyle and Erik, the real ones. Just a nanosecond, but it was gut-wrenching and my heart went into my throat, and I immediately started sobbing. I'm sure it was because of the last verse of the song being played at that crucial time. I'm a big fan of Crowded House and Neil Finn, and I know the song so very, very well ... I was 22 when it was released ... and I know all the lyrics, what it's about, per Neil Finn. But in that scene, in that moment, it was like the song was written for the brothers. The choice to name that episode after the song, and end the episode with the last verse, was, IMHO, brilliant. Brilliant.

Enough tangent. I also gave it a 9 because of the casting, with 1 exception. Javier Bardem was terrifying. Cooper Koch as Erik and Nicholas Chavez as Lyle were brilliant. Sometimes I forgot they were actors. Nathan Lane as Dominick Dunne was another great choice. Chloë Sevigny is one of my favorite actresses, but I'm not sure she was right for Kitty. She is too pretty and too thin for what Kitty looked like at that time. She's too, elegant. And the wig was just horrible. It looks like the same one from Swans, lol. I can't think of another actress who would've been more appropriate, but I'm not a casting director. Jose looked a lot older than his 45 years, and Bardem fit the bill. Kitty was overweight, puffy, with sallow skin and horrible dyed blond hair with DARK eyebrows and she for sure looked years beyond 47. Sevigny is just too pretty. I also felt she didn't have a connection with her character.

In spite of the couple of criticisms I have, I am starting Monsters over again tonight, I liked it that much. So a 9 it is."
6.0,11 December 2022,"Not sure why nobody has talked about how great Richard Jenkins acts in this show. He should get an award for portraying the father in this show. Evan was good of course and this was a well written show. The stories are pretty accurate and you'll probably binge this for sure. It's not as gory as you think it would be, but you don't need it to be. It's such a crazy sad story and terrible this actually happened. Now I don't know what to watch next any recommendations would be great! FYI Molly Ringwold is in this and at first I did not recognize her. She was big in the 80's and it's great to see her acting again."
10.0,21 September 2022,"This is the best serial killer serialisation I've ever watched. It gave great insight into the back story and the crimes. Not least the despicable behaviour of the police at that time.

I cannot even imagine the horrors of his police having to work on this case; it must have been absolutely horrific.

And his parents, how guilty they must still feel if they're still alive. It must be like living in hell on earth.

It was sad to see survivors having to live with this grotesque memory for the rest of their own lives.

I'd like to hope that this director and writers look at other serial killers and look to create again."
6.0,25 September 2022,"First, this was an incredible docudrama. Evan Peters is phenomenal. The rest of the cast is.. wow. Seeing the side of the victims was a new view of what we normally see in true crime. I think Tony Hughes broke my heart the most. Some of you say, ""the woke and the liberal make it this and that"". He literally got away with it for so long because he was a intelligent, white male. There are recordings of police laughing joking about gay men and racism. Those two factors let this disgusting monster brutalize men for over 10 years. If you don't get that, you are no better. Take a look at yourself. SMH."
8.0,28 October 2022,"10 episodes seem too long for his story, I guess. Especially, when he kills young men and eats them in almost all the stories. It could easily have been cut short to 4-5 episodes. But Evan Peters acted wonderfully. He truly acted like a monster, his dialogue delivery carried a good weightage. The screenplay is too slow but the performance was outstanding makes this limited webseries swing between good and bad. Some scenes were not watchable to be honest. The blood, bone, arteries and the heart, gosh, that was just too much. Apart from the bloodstained scenes which were aptly put as the subject was Dahmer, the father and the grandma played beautiful roles."
7.0,10 October 2022,
5.0,6 October 2024,"I found this series was very inaccurate and made the case seem less serious than it was. They kind of turned it into a comedy which I think is quite disrespectful considering half of it wasn't real. I think some parts were good but most of the show was very bias against the brothers. I don't doubt some of it was real but it could've been more factual. Some scenes were unecesarry like the Halloween giving out sweets. In these kind of scenes they portrayed Lyle as a villain when again THIS IS A TRUE STORY. But overall I enjoyed watching it but i wouldn't watch it to find out about the case. In the series we don't learn much about the boys childhood just that they were: rich , arrogant , mean , and the parents weren't around much in the house."
9.0,26 January 2023,
8.0,14 October 2022,"First of all I want to say that Evan Peters and Richard Perkins absolutely knock it out the park in this series, and to be honest, all the actors are great. There's things missed out on though which are maybe too heavy for the series but it's already heavy enough so why not if they're in the actual accounts confirmed. Why they made Tony's friend black is pointless as he is an actual bigger part of the story than shown. He was a big suspect in the disappearance of Tony and was realy given a tough time from the police. It also didn't tell the full details of what Dahmer done with his victims after killing them. The clarity of the timeline isn't great either. I have no problem jumping from 1989 to 78 then 91 for instance, but it's only shown what year it's bounced to a few times in this whole series and could be confusing to some.

All in all I'd recommend it to friends but anyone who has seen ""Dahmer on Dahmer"" will know more details than given in this 50 hour series."
9.0,25 September 2022,"Heavy-handed, obvious, and bordering on theatrical. Complete with cops affecting Fargo accents and a wooden Dhamer performance that comes across like a Joe Pera impersonation, this is a truly strange and uneven series from the mind behind Glee and Eat Pray Love. Certainly research was done, but to what extent it is hard to say, as ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, A Story About Jeffery Dahmer and All Those People Who Were Killed (By Dahmer The Monster)"" seems to bounce around and highlight the parts it sees fit in a sort-of-socially-relevant-but-still-luridly-entertaining type of way.

Thankfully we have the always reliable Richard Jenkins to keep us coming back for an emotional and empathetic performance."
9.0,20 June 2023,"Superb. A chilling look at the life of this notorious serial killer.

The performances are expectational, especially PETERS, and a special mention for Richard Jenkins, who puts in one of the best performances I have ever seen in a mini-series.

My only two criticisms surround the last few episodes that seem to focus more on the troubles and tribulations of Glenda rather than the sequence of events. She almost gets to the point of coming across a little sanctimonious, however horrendous her experiences clearly were.

The court case (I know it was a guilty plea) was also covered in the space of 5 minutes, when I can imagine the emotion and drama of his crimes would have reached their peak.

Overall a majestic portrayal, and one I will likely enjoy a third time in the future."
7.0,14 October 2024,"After watching the latest edition of Ryan Murphy's ""Monsters"" (following the one about Jeffrey Dahmer) and the new documentary, ""The Menendez Brothers"", I've now had my fill of this bit of 90s pop culture. That said, and while there's much that could be discussed and debated, I'll just say I think they should be released from prison. Irrespective of what douchebags they may have once been (or still could be), I think they were ultimately shafted and made to pay in part for the grievous injustice done with the O. J. Simpson acquittal. The series is a typical Murphy production, with innuendo and glossy sheen layered over grotesquerie, with good performances all around and enough questions raised to make it worth watching. Of note in particular is Cooper Koch's brilliant scene in E05 in one unbroken take. The documentary, with their recorded voices from prison, is a good complement to the series, and mainly serves to show they were likely telling the truth about the lifelong abuse, and, so the two brothers have paid a heavy price for helping bring awareness of male sexual abuse out of the shadows where it'd lingered for so long."
10.0,12 October 2024,"Good acting by all involved. I could remember the court case being in the papers and on TV in America so it was good to see the details, even if a lot of them are embelished, like all series on netflix have to do. Watching it you swing from feeling like they should get the gas chamber early on to feeling sorry for the boys, then swinging back till in the end you really aren't sure what to believe. The young guys playing the brothers are excellent, Javier Bardem is a lot more scary than their real Dad looked but you can see why two strapping boys would and could be scared of an elder figure in their lives. Court scenes were excellent and the lawyers believable."
6.0,18 December 2023,I was already a huge Peter's fan from AHS but he blew my mind as Dahmer! This was so horrifying and yet satisfying to watch and a part of me felt guilty for enjoying it so much! I actually stayed up until 3am just so I could finish it so it must have been good because I love my sleep! I love that the victim's stories were such a big part of Dahmer because I think sometimes so much focus is on the character and trying to understand the mind of the killer that we as humans forget that lives were destroyed by this person that committed the crimes/killings and actually seeing the background of the victims and also their families made it hit home to me.
10.0,20 September 2024,"This is what happens when people put expectations on movies and TV shows and are let down.

The complaining begins.

First of all, it's mostly fictional and he has stated a lot of his work is from the start. He over dramatizes his work and it makes for good entertainment. Unfortunate to say but isn't this already recycled entertainment?

Just like Dahmer and now with the 3rd installment coming, Ed Gein?

Secondly, the parents were dead and couldn't defend themselves against the abuse allegations.

The first jury was deadlocked despite 30-50 witnesses coming forward saying they were abused.

I DO NOT DISCOUNT THE ABUSE MAY HAVE HAPPENED.

Finally, they killed their parents and they were going to be cut out of the will. Those are facts.

So, it all comes down to: THEY KILLED THEIR PARENTS and that's the ONLY reason in the second trial they didn't use the abuse defense. It was considered hearsay.

THEY HAD OTHER OPTIONS BUT THEY OPTED TO KILL THEIR PARENTS.

I can't stand my parents and there was physical, psychological, and verbal abuse in my home. Yet, they're still alive.

Empathy from me, yes. Sympathy, no."
6.0,26 June 2024,"This is a solid character study that stays away from sensationalization and glorification of Dahmer. If it sexualizes his killings, that's because Dahmer himself sexualized his own killings. If you wish to understand Dahmer a bit more than you currently do, then watch this tv show. The central performance is beyond brilliant and so is the performance of Dahmer's father. These performance alone justify this show's existence.

Moralizers and virtue signallers who protested this show only ended up raising its notoriety and helped make it the no.2 TV show of 2022 lol. They would do well to learn about the Streisand Effect. Nothing contributes to Thing A's popularity like people complaining about Thing A's existence lmao!

Some people say ""Imagine how Dahmer's victim's families would react to this show"", and i reply by stating the truth: their reaction is not my responsibility. I do not care, why should i? No one gets to STOP any piece of art from getting created - no one and that includes them. No one is forcing his victim's families to watch this tv show. They are adults who can avoid watching this show. Stop speaking ""on their behalf"" - all you're doing is putting words in their mouths in order to feel like a hero.

As for people dressing up as Dahmer for Halloween? People have been dressing up as Dahmer since his trial. People even proposed to Dahmer via letters. This is nothing new. You cannot blame this TV show for the fact that a tiny section of humanity is and always has been attracted to serial killers and violent people. How many serial killers have found love in prison? How many have gotten married while serving out their sentence? This has always been going on, the question is: Does this show glorify Dahmer and encourage that sort of behaviour? It doesn't.

Also the people losing their minds over the fact that Dahmer was in fact a good-looking man are crazy. It makes no sense to portray Dahmer as ugly lol. He was indeed goodlooking. His looks lured his victims to his apartment ffs. If he was ugly then this tactic of his wouldn't have worked as well as it did. If you wanna pretend that Dahmer was ""ugly"" then you are re-writing history and dishonouring the memory of his victims. They fell for his trick BECAUSE of his good looks. Pretending like he was ugly undermines his victims' experience.

I hate how my review turned into this. I would love to talk about the actual show itself, but the backlash against this show needs to be addressed, and the backlash is so weak that it doesn't mention any of the things about this show that actually matter aka its performance, its writing, its cinematography, its casting, etc. So i am reduced to lowering myself and meeting the ""critics"" (lol) at their level."
1.0,27 September 2022,"Evan Peters was fantastic, but the story was slow and was full or inaccuracies. It was watchable, and some of the scenes accurately portrayed, but just not what I was expecting knowing the case quite well.

The real story is much more sister, but I guess they could not really portray all of the details.

The casting was great and the settings great, but I think it would have done the victims more justice if they had all had a mention so to speak. And maybe use of more of the information from his interviews would have been an added aspect.

I'm not sure why deviations from the facts were included, perhaps for storytelling, but overall I was quite disappointed."
8.0,26 September 2022,"So from beginning to the end, this show had me gripped, it's been delivered so well. Evan Peters is outstanding and should definitely be nominated for his impeccable performance of Jeremy Dahmer. Richard Jenkins who plays his Dad displayed unconditional love despite what was happening and also delivered a great performance. I couldn't wait to watch the next episode once one had finished. At times, yes, this is a tough watch, the families of those involved is heartbreaking. This show raises an awareness of a number of things, and it was all portrayed as well as it could be. Very well done to all involved."

8.0,25 October 2022,"I don't care how much money is spent, I don't care how much effort the actors and crew who worked on this put in. This isn't some fictional character we're talking about, this was a real person, who really did horrendous things. And now you're going to make a production, complete with recreating these killings? That is disgusting. I watched two episodes with my family, it was horrible. I only understand the obsession with this type of stuff up to the point of trying to figure out how their minds worked. Anything beyond that is a complete mystery to me. But guess what, a production is not needed to find out how his mind worked, an article written, or a short documentary explaining these things would be far better. The point is to entertain? Who could be entertained by watching the recreation of a psychopath's killings? Someone who couldn't think: ""what if my child, my brother, my nephew, were murdered and their body brutally desecrated, and the person who did it gets a TV show made about them where the killing is recreated?"" And I heard in many of the reviews that certain parts of what happened were changed to make a political statement even though it alters facts, that makes it even worse if true. Shame on whoever thought this was a good idea."
9.0,30 October 2022,"Every weekend in Chicago, black youths murder up to 50 other black youths and Leftist Hollywood/Silicon Valley still wants us to focus our attention on the racism of SOME white police officers over 60 years ago! It's really obnoxious, passe presentism, everyone is sick to death of it, Dahmer himself was clearly not a racist and racism should not have been the primary focus of this intense and beautifully made series.

ALL THAT SAID, the series did an incredible job of showing the experience of Dahmer's family, his victims and the families of his victims. Every performance was incredible and irresistible. Molly Ringwald was uniquely impressive as Dahmer's father's second wife, manifesting a supremely confident, strong, self-assured, loyal and empathic type of female character you don't often see in contemporary films at all."
6.0,9 December 2022,"Absolutely incredible performance and whilst it's frightening what Dahmer did it's evident that his parents completely messed him up and created the monster themselves.

At times you can actually feel sorry for Dahmer and that is down to the genius performance given by Evan Peters.

In fact I didn't realise it was Evan Peters until the fourth episode - having seen him in AHS it has made me want to watch it all over again as well as Dahmer.

Truly incredible but of course the actual story is very unsettling

Ten out of ten For every aspect of this amazing production. Evan Peters deserves awards."
10.0,3 October 2022,"10 episodes of 1hr each... This is detailed with not one boring part, scene or character. The story is told in a somewhat non-linear way, which does work well. All the characters are detailed and given the time needed to tell their story successfully. The acting from Peter's and all the cast was excellent, and this along with 'Candy' should be in the mix come ward season.

Now, obviously this is a difficult story to watch at btimes, especially for the details provided. However, most of the disturbing scenes and horror elements are written and filmed in such a way to avoid gore and shock factor, often just hearing sounds from a neighbours house etc...

Could it have been shorter, maybe, but you can't deny the effort and detail that went into this..."
6.0,30 November 2022,Evan Peters is terrific in the role of Jeff Dahmer. Even the voice and the tone and the accent is matched. I really enjoyed this show a lot. Richard Jenkins also did a really great job at playing Dahmer's father. I'm really impressed. Also the background music is very good. I this show is popular and also getting a lot of negative criticism because of the glorification of a serial killer. But I think the writers of this show hadn't this intention in their mind. This show is successfully able to tell the real story of not just about the serial killer but also the social system that leads to his venture keeps going on. Really good show. Everyone should watch this show at least one time!
10.0,25 September 2024,
6.0,10 October 2022,"Evan peters did an exceptional job here. To portray a character means literally bend your mind and mood towards the whims of that character. To top it off he portrayed a serial killer with intricate details in the fashion in which the real Dahmer made the kills! To an extent this show captured the emotional trauma so brilliantly that sometimes you yourself will get traumatized of the world around you. Last but not the least, the research work that went into this is absolutely remarkable. The show is slow but the built up of the climax to every kill is so much worth the effort and the wait. This is a show every parent of every child should watch and adhere word to word. This is ""what not to do as a parent 101""."
5.0,15 October 2024,"The Monsters series on the Menéndez case feels like a surface-level exploration of an incredibly complex and tragic story. Instead of diving into the profound emotional and psychological struggles that the Menéndez brothers faced, the series seems more interested in showcasing the glitz and drama of their Hollywood lives. It's as if the producers opted for shock value and entertainment over substance, glossing over the harrowing abuse and deep family dysfunction that fueled the crime.

This case isn't just about a couple of rich kids gone wrong; it's a disturbing reflection of power, manipulation, and the darker side of privilege. Yet, the series reduces it to a spectacle, playing up the glamour and ignoring the humanity. There was a chance to explore deeper themes-like the cycle of abuse, the pressure of living in the public eye, and the psychological impact on the brothers-but instead, we get a shiny, almost voyeuristic retelling that barely scratches the surface.

The result is a show that feels more like tabloid fodder than a thoughtful examination of one of the most infamous cases in American legal history. For anyone looking for insight or a meaningful narrative, Monsters sadly falls short, prioritizing drama over the real-life consequences and emotional weight of the Menéndez brothers' actions."
10.0,26 September 2022,"Wow. This was disturbing to watch, the story. How sick this guy was from an early age. The signs were all there. His family knew something was not right with him. But never really did anything. I guess what could they. Denial I think the gravity of it.

The apartment he lived in, the way the police didn't care. Didn't respond. Shocking. The smells. The noises. All the calls the neighbour made to 911. They never came. The poor 14 year old boy and his family, who had already been victims of this monster. Trusting young men, taken advantage of.

The victims. Appalling their deaths. Couldn't turn it off. Great acting. Well written and fab cast. Evans is totally believable."
9.0,8 October 2024,
9.0,23 September 2024,"I suppose it begs the question why Ryan Murphy felt the need to add so much poetic licence to his ""show"". I mean this is a true story. Lyle & Erik are still alive. And whether you believe they had a reason to do what they did or not, surely Murphy as the shoes creator has a duty to be factual and not sensationalise an already unbelievable story with what appears to be some whopping untruths.

Erik & Lyle have categorically stated they did not have an incenstouous relationship so why paint it as such?

And why were the interrogations so graphic when it comes to explaining the child sexual abuse. I don't think I've ever heard this kind of detail before and tbh, it made me turn it off. We know child abuse is horrific, getting down to the nitty gritty details in the name of entertainment is just crass. It's not like this is a new story.

I stopped at episode 5 and haven't continued watching.

That being said, the acting is good. Especially Cooper Koch."
8.0,1 October 2022,"This is some seriously quality work, from the way the story is structured, to the respect it shows the victims, to the amazing cast. This is not some cheap slasher cash-in, but a seriously thought provoking and moving experience. We are able to see the story from many angles, most of them absolutely heartbreaking. It makes us feel for the victims, for their families, for others impacted, and even for Dahmer's family. But it does so without making excuses or having us sympathize with Dahmer himself. I could go on and on about the performances, but suffice to say EVERYONE brought their A-game. Hats off to everyone involved."
6.0,18 November 2022,"""DAHMER - MONSTER: THE STORY OF JEFFREY DAHMER"" made me a little suspicious when the trailer was announced and viewed.

I was afraid that Dahmer's cruel deeds would be used solely to generate quotas and glorify Dahmer.

When you look at it, it quickly becomes clear that this is not the intention of the series at all.

The series does not show the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer but focuses much more on the person Jeffrey Dahmer.

Dahmer's story is used here as an extreme example of what the consequences can be when a child is not given enough attention by its parents and therefore cannot confide in them.

It becomes clear that Dahmer's actions could have been prevented if he had grown up with a family that paid attention to him and was therefore not alone in his feelings.

While Dahmer's actions were undoubtedly terrible and his punishment more than just, he wasn't really a bad person, just sick.

All this is underlined again with the phenomenal acting of Evan Peters.

So don't expect a scary series here, but rather the sad biography of a person who could only satisfy his cravings with the unconventional means of murder."
10.0,3 October 2024,"Ryan Murphy has this uncanny ability to take the most horrendous, gut-wrenching cases and somehow make them... sexy. It's a strange line to walk, but he does it brilliantly. His casting choices are always on point, with actors that resemble their characters just enough-yet with that polished, almost pornographic touch that makes it all the more eerie. In Monsters, the suspense is palpable. Murphy knows how to keep you on edge, making you question everything, even your own sense of morality. The gaslighting, the tension-it all leaves you wondering, ""what lines would I cross in these monstrous circumstances?"". Murphy turns the worst of humanity into something deeply watchable, while forcing us to confront the darkest parts of ourselves. It's twisted, but you can't look away."
6.0,4 December 2022,"If based on a true story, you would expect the show to be historically accurate, which it is not.

It's almost a complete fiction, so if we take ""based on a true story"" out of the equation, what's so good there is left about this show? I just don't see it, besides the two really amazing actors, Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins.

So what's the purpose of this show?

It's not a fiction for entertainment, and they are not trying to cover the Dahmer's story and teach us something about that really happened.

It's just another pathetic attempt to rewrite a historical event in a way to serve the modern days political agenda. And people fall for it like schoolgirls in love."
8.0,22 September 2022,"Great show. A slow burn. Really disturbing, twisted and sad all at the same time. Honestly there were parts I had to turn away.(the blood drinking scene. I know it's fake but stilll) lol. Gave an unsettling kind of vibe and gut wrenching realization of what atrocities this monster committed. It's heartbreaking to know this guy could have been stopped multiple times and the cops failed smh.. Definitely getting the show mindhunter vibes~ The show reaches for an uncomfortable reality at every level, from its wearied set design to Peters' monotone manner of speaking. The show really prioritizes the voices and narratives of Dahmer's victims over the man himself. It's a creative choice that makes the resulting series endlessly tense while giving this story the weight it deserves."
6.0,23 October 2022,"I don't want this review to sound like I'm only complaining. There is a ton about this show to like. It was very well made. Phenomenal acting. Disturbing atmosphere. I really DID enjoy it quite a bit. I would recommend it.

But it goes off the rails exactly halfway through. Up to episode 5, I was hooked. Starting with the 6th it got progressively boring and slow. They threw a whole episode away on the deaf guy and it somehow became the Niecy Nash show.

On top of that, they totally rewrote things to give them some kind of political or social justice edge. Exaggerations to flat out fabrications.

Don't treat this as a documentary in any way. It's WILDLY inaccurate. They basically took the real people/places and tossed them into a sandbox to arrange them how they wanted but much of it is wrong. When you see the little asterisk with *based on true events* take them at their word... lightly ""based on"" with ridiculous liberties. I have to deduct major points for that, especially with how they tried to spin it.

And I wish they would have focused more on the killings but they kind of glossed over it while making it minimally gory. Much is implied but not shown. I'm not a fan of that style when it comes to horror or crime.

One thing I want to say that they did amazingly well, and I don't know if it was even on purpose, was the portrayal of Jeffrey's feelings and struggles with a personality disorder. I was diagnosed in my early 20's with the same thing as Dahmer, Borderline Personality Disorder. In this show he expressed constant and chronic feelings of emptiness, loneliness, and despair which led him to self-destructive behaviors and habits. They really got that right. I felt what Dahmer felt. I've lived that experience.

Anyway, enjoy it but remember that it's entertainment and not a history lesson."
5.0,6 October 2024,"I feel compelled to thank Ryan Murphy and team for the emotion they were able to elicit at the end of episode 6 ""Don't Dream it's Over"". This crescendo brought together the complicated and disturbing behaviors of every character in a portrayal that solicits just as much complicated and disturbing emotions from its audience. It's a powerful scene.

Ep 5 is powerful in its own and very important way which also deserves recognition. The script and acting accurately depict the nuance and difficulty for a child who is trying for the first time to speak out loud what happened to them while also managing the internal conflict of loving the parent and despising what they've done to you.

There are critics of this production who want more accuracy in the telling. I don't know the facts but I can confidently say that Episodes 5&6 are successful in powerful storytelling. If the goal is to bring the audience on the emotional journey of Lyle and Erik's life (and a life of male sexual familial abuse) then it was achieved.

This team clearly took care to depict the story with compassion and contentiousness while also giving viewers something sensational to watch unfold. Each character is fully developed, giving us a 360 view of a whole person. Anyone who is affected by and passionate about preventing child sex abuse and empowering male victims should be grateful for the light this season shines on the issue and the care taken to address it with respect."
8.0,26 September 2024,"The show started out on episode 1 through 4, maybe 5 with all the details about the Menendez family and the estate and the details of the gruesome murders. But after that, I felt the show fell a little bit flat. It felt to me it was just all commentary from Dominic and the annoying juror lady in episode 9 when the defendants were found guilty. I think the problem was that most people know how the story ends and I felt the creativity was left out of that because we already knew where the show was going and to have commentary between Dominic and the juror, seemed like those were filler scenes and there was no context to it all and they just left us, the audience, to just decipher what's going on. I don't know, but it could've been better writing towards the end. Dominic's character was useless redundant and needed not to be in the. I gave the series an overall 6/10 for the review with episode nine being number 1/10 for me."
10.0,19 October 2022,"Out of the numerous adaptations of the Jeffrey Dahmer case, Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story tells the story best. It reenacts the story as realistically as it can possibly get. It lays off on the gore and violence, and focuses more on his relationships and personal life. But even though it isn't as gore as it can possibly get, it still can be difficult to watch for some.

The show does a great job at creating an unsettling atmosphere, using a lot of yellows in its cinematography. The score is also very melancholic and uneasy and it just adds more to the atmosphere. The acting is also very well done, making it quite believable.

Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is an eerie and believable adaptation of one of the most horrific cases in history. It's well crafted and does a great job at reenacting true events. It is worth a watch, but it may not be for everybody because this is the Jeffrey Dahmer story."
10.0,7 October 2022,"I was intrigued by the first couple of episodes and had high hopes for the show but netflix did it again... I like how it started off with a ""true story"" format but it failed this premise by falling the show with an unnecessary racial narrutive and just plan fiction.

The acting by Richard Jenkins was superb on the other hand the acting by Evan Peters.. not sure what to say... maybe it would be ""good"" if he was portraying a fictional character but with this many videos on YouTube on Dahmer why did his character turned out to be so dull.... Also, whats up with that fake accent?

I do appreciate how they made a series without glorifying Dahmer and avoided being too graphic with the murders (thing that I generally enjoy seeing but hats off for trying something different) but in the end this just another netflix show. And judging by the high ratings, netflix will just keep doing the same."
6.0,6 October 2022,"Like most Ryan Murphy projects, this one is also very messy and all over the place. It tries to be many things at once and ends up being ineffective and way too melodramatic. It attempts to depict true crime and horror and blend them into one, but fails to do so. The script takes many liberties that ultimately don't pay off and the social agenda behind it all is overblown. The dialogue is exaggerated and unnatural, very much in the style of Ryan Murphy. The series starts off strong, but later episodes seem extremely rushed and weak. Character performances are very captivating, especially Richard Jenkins, who is the high point of the series, even though Evan Peters is also admirable."
10.0,22 March 2023,"I was wondering where I was going to finally start this review but now I know: according to the trivia section this was written with one rule in mind: it was not going to be from Jeffrey's point of view.

Dude...if that was your goal, you failed UTTERLY!

This is totally from his point of view. In fact, it feels desperate to make him into the most sympathetic character on screen. Perhaps that's an exaggeration but that was a reason why it took me a while to get round to writing this. I wasn't going to watch it because everyone was talking about it but I had too many direct word of mouth recommendations to not.

Watching this was an odyssey into myself, sort of like Lionel and his own book. I'm not quite sure why I kept making excuses for him. What I saw was a portrait of an individual who, at least at first, was the victim of a callous culture. A better culture than most the world but still intolerant of queer people and where parents either will not or cannot speak candidly with their children.

As we see the very mundane (in the good way) journey of Dahmer into darkness, it is easy to relate to someone who didn't identify well with people (and vice versa) and didn't harmonize with people's strict expectations. His story is one of alienation. It began as a life where he had basically nothing to get excited or passionate about and ultimately was cursed with this one thing that made life more than one long bore.

This is the impression I got from the show. Of course this Jeffrey and real Jeffrey are different people and I have indeed demarcated them in my mind. This is the not the 100% dramatized documentary like Schindler's List or Boys Don't Cry, this feels like just another TV show (albeit a good one). You never forget that it's based on fact which helps with the non-linear (and often meandering) narrative a lot.

Prudently, this sort of begins at the (almost end). We all know there's no real happy ending coming so we get that out of the way and then get straight onto humanizing child-Dahmer.

It is a poignant and bleak tale that (regrettably) isn't above getting a bit sentimental once in a while. It's admirable that they focus on how Jeffrey's crimes are not just his crimes but those of society. Not just through police misconduct but in the culture we leave. He is ultimately liable, I must admit, but considering he gets exactly the punitive measures he deserves, it is difficult to hate this Jeffrey. Like a hurricane that takes many lives and then dissipates the feeling is not anger but a sense of profound tragedy tinged with fear.

Shot with a eerie yellow filter, you get right in Jeffrey's head as an appreciate of the sensual and intimate and as someone who craved connection but couldn't stand the rejection potential of a sentient human.

It's a lot less interesting when we are following anyone who isn't jeff. There's almost no really sympathetic characters hear. The subplot about bad police is pertinent and relevant to the story but was not that interesting to me even though I am part of that ""don't trust the police"" choir.

I thought his neighbour was kind of annoying and obnoxious. Clearly in the right but that's not the point.

Anyway, it's not a horror, but it's worth seeing."
7.0,15 October 2022,"I almost gave up on this series because episode 1 was so terrifying. I am a movie buff and lover of scary movies, science fiction, aliens, etc. But the very first episode of this series was the most scariest and disturbing that I had to wait another two weeks before I started episode 2. I wasn't actually going to finish the series until I read reviews that I needed to stick through. And glad that I did because the director in the writer is top notch. I really did know about this story actually I thought I did but after watching all of the episodes all of the biographies didn't even come close. The actors are amazing, the writers amazing, director's amazing, sound amazing, the whole crew is top-notch. I had to stop every episode or two and go back to the real story. This series is not for the faint of heart, but it is for those that want to educate themselves to be on the lookout."
9.0,14 February 2023,
6.0,4 October 2022,"No one will dispute what Dahmer did was morally reprehensible. In dramatising his life, they took pains to illustrate the structural and overt racism that provided the opportunities for Dahmer to escape capture for 13 years and commit many more murders. Ironically, both Netflix and Murphy seem blinded to their own hypocrisy in going through with making this show without due regard for the families of the mostly non-white victims.

The hype surrounding this series is just reaching fever pitch in Australia as the first wave of viewers are now telling others about it. As much as I love true crime, I resisted watching at first because the series is done in poor taste, but curiosity eventually triumphed. The series brings to light certain things I never knew or thought I needed to know about Dahmer. Strangely, the more I learnt about him through the series, the less he seemed the ""monster"" that is in the show's title.

He was clinically diagnosed with borderline and schizotypal personality disorders and psychosis. He has also been called a psychopath and a sociopath. Psychopaths and sociopaths rarely ever show remorse like Dahmer did. Nor would they admit there was anything wrong with them; Dahmer had always known there was something intrinsically different about him. Even though it has not been suggested, I think it is likely that he might have been neurodivergent.

The neurodivergent community would be rightly horrified to be associated with Dahmer. If they were honest with themselves however, they could probably identify with Dahmer's struggles: social awkwardness, the inability to connect with people, the loneliness of being different, the escape into fantasy (and sometimes addiction) to avoid unbearable emotional pain. Unlike most, Dahmer's fantasy unfortunately required people to be dead in order for him to achieve the peculiar kind of control and intimacy that only he craved."
9.0,11 November 2022,"This show is excellent in telling the horrific true story of Dahmer and all of the lives and communities his crimes affected. The show also sheds a light on several important issues that contributed to the outcome. The acting is phenomenal and the show leaves you with a haunted feeling that lingers on inside you for many days after watching it. I really appreciate that the show focuses not only on Dahmer and his darkness, but also the people around him, including his family, neighbors and victims. The show managed to teach me about a lot of important things, such as who the victims were, police corruption and what red flags to look out for when it comes to individuals like Dahmer."
10.0,2 October 2022,"Few stories are sadder and more disturbing than what happened to those men. I would have liked to know more about them individually instead of the focus turning to political messaging. People can come to their own conclusions without activists spoon-feeding people what to think.

Also...if police could barge into apartments just because of rumors or without having the proper legal cause to actually perform searches, something tells me things would be even worse for everyone.

Dahmer was a monster. I wish we could have caught him sooner but not by giving police easier access into people's homes."
10.0,7 January 2023,This show was beautiful cinematography. The direction was very smart and in the end it was gorgeous. Many scene was very interesting to analyse. After the acting was perfect of Evan Peter but also of all the actor was amazing. But really I advice everyone to watch it because in the editing and the direction are just very very good. I very like this show because really you cannot have any consideration from the serial killer the direction of actor show him like very very weird and the acting of Evan Peter make really better how he walk act and look I he was really inside his characters really impressive.
10.0,22 September 2022,"This story could have been told in half the episodes. Much of the ""side"" plots was irrelevant. It was also far too kind to this serial murderer. Not worth watching. Trying to draw comparisons to another serial killer and some eclipse of the sun is just silly. People want to know about this serial killer - I personally don't believe many of the ""facts"" set forth in the program. I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching 10 episodes where virtually nothing of interest was depicted. I actually watched witness evidence (real witness evidence of the trial) and it was far more compelling than this dreary, boring and lengthy ""documentary""."
6.0,8 October 2022,"Evan Peters is excellent in the lead role and really captures Dahmer. Overall, the show is excellent. They do a good job of really allowing focus on the victims while telling the story. Really difficult subject matter to get right and they did a good job.

There are a couple of episodes that are unnecessary, creating a composite character to tell a story that really isn't needed but seems a prerequisite for all movies and tv shows these days.

In my opinion, episode 7 is totally unnecessary, it would have made more sense to just tell the story of the real people rather than merge them, other than that the show is 10/10."
10.0,5 November 2022,"It could be the top most example of how a film can be made on such an intense subject. It's that brilliant and beyond words. It's gripping from the word get go. It's intense, it's dark. The way it is executed from ""film making"" perspective it is absolutely amazing. And performances are so real, those will make you think you are looking at the real actual people of that time. The story telling and direction is 10 on 10. This is how you create a crime drama series. Also need to mention about the detailing, every frame, every scene will keep you engaged. I would like to suggest that if you like to watch crime drama series then this is it."
7.0,30 September 2024,
8.0,22 September 2022,"An excellent series which provides different prospectives and is an eye opener for viewers. Evan Peters has excelled in his portrayal of Jeffery Dahamar along with excellent performances by the rest of the cast.

The intertwined viewpoints of different people in this recount of events allows the audience to get to grips with the effects of events on each of the protagonists. It also asks the question of whether we have learnt anything as a society on how to prevent serial killers or events like this occurring again and whether the killer becomes the focal point rather than the victims - this series really gets to the core of how families of the victims feel in the aftermath."
7.0,21 February 2023,
3.0,23 September 2022,"I have watched almost every serial killer doc, tv series, and movie imaginable. With that said, I have never seen one capture the darkest crevices of the serial killers mind like Dahmer does. Unlike other shows, you also get to know the victims on a personal level. This has to be the best portrayal of a serial killer ever captured on film. Its brilliantly written and its terrifying. It has every element you would want in a series like this and some. It does not shy away from details no matter how brutal it may be. I hope this director decides to capture other serial killers. All I have to say is BRAVO!"
10.0,5 October 2022,"I was in my early 20's when he was arrested and his story unfolded live on the news at the time, so I remember it and have watched programs about him ever since. The main actor is the best Dahmer so far, by far. It's a brutal series and once again left me disgusted. His wicked and twisted behaviour is well performed and ""just enough"" to want to turn it off because it's starting to be too much for a normal person to handle..but then suddenly...it isn't. I'd say the first few episodes sort of seem slow, but somehow they're not because it's so heavy...I carried on and am glad I did because the last few episodes take a different direction and there's more about other things going on and other sides to situations and victims. I'll stop there, but it was worth my time."
10.0,23 September 2022,"Okay, so, this doesn't pull any punches, with respects to certain grisly details, but at the same time lands each blow with considerable care. We do see quite a good deal of the rather more grim elements of the story, the behaviour, but it's been so sensitively crafted that it's impossible not to feel some amount of sadness for Dahmer on elements of his journey in between killings. The loneliness is so expertly depicted. There's one episode that gives us more of a victim POV, I won't say which, that was so beautifully done that, while also exhibiting some additional degree of horror in relation to what happened in the end, that was so beautifully constructed that rather more than horror, I felt an unexpected and considerable sense of grief, even though I knew what was coming.

Anyway, it's almost perfect. Doesn't quite land perfectly at the end, goes on a little long, could have been stripped down to maybe 8 episodes, the ending appearing to drag on a little. Nothing major, it's still all very well done otherwise.

Evan Peters is fantastic, as Jeffrey Dahmer, and his horribly conflicted and disturbed Dad, Lionel, is played beautifully by Richard Jenkins. Everyone in it is marvellous actually."
8.0,31 August 2023,
9.0,12 October 2022,
6.0,26 September 2022,"It almost feels wrong to call it ""great"" or ""really good"" given what happened. I spent many of the scenes thinking of how would the victims families feel about so much horrific detail in specific scenes. It almost feels exploitative at times of the victims and their families.

On the other hand, I believe it's also one of the best directed and acted (Evan Peters) series I have ever seen. The feel of the show is hard to put into words, Horrifying, Jaw-dropping or Chilling? Either way you cannot stop watching. The Negative reviews about the series being too long or slow are rubbish. Part of the reason the show is rating so highly is due to the depth they go into for some scenes, something that likely wouldn't have been achieved over a series with 4 episode or the like.

I'm not sure the show should have been made but ultimately it was and is now out there. Therefore, it deserves a 10 for what it is, whether it should have been made is a separate issue."
8.0,10 October 2022,"The first twenty-five minutes of this masterpiece comprise the most terrifying scenes I've seen in serial killer movie making, real or fictional. Totally blew me away. Exceptional in every way. The actors, wow, been a long time since I saw acting of this calibre. And the cinematography, the timing, the score, the directing, the editing, it's ALL just brilliant.

Pour yourself a drink, or better yet just put the whole bottle on the table and prepare yourself for a baggy-eyed day tomorrow while you binge this until your boss calls to ask you why you're not at work. Or haven't been at work for the last two days.

Since I have to make it to 600 characters, I'll add that I did think some episodes were more gripping than others, and some scenes felt a little repetitive (especially with/about Dahmer's neighbour Glenda Cleveland). I should also add I think this stands out because the rest is so incredible. A 10 out of 10 for me, highly recommend."
7.0,23 September 2022,"This is very good. First episode was incredible, very well paced and acted and the production values are very high.

Subsequent episodes are less compelling and act more as history lesson in how this odd ball was able to morph into the cannibal he became and how he evaded capture. There are some awkward 2022 racial politics inserted, as we should expect unfortunately.

His childhood and early adulthood are well documented and other films have been made about his school days such as My Friend Dahmer, and this show references that period in his life to good effect.

I'm over half way through so I wanted to add a review to encourage others to give it a go, it's grim, especially early on, but it's very well made and worth your time.

Edit: now finished the show and the 2nd half is actually much better and gives the victims much more air time. Those who have criticised the show should have watched it through before doing so!"
10.0,22 September 2022,"I've been waiting for something since Mind-Hunter got cancelled that would fill it's sinister void, and this new limited series by story-telling legend Ryan Murphy is IT!!

Absolutely loved Crime Story & AHS so I knew this would be to the same high standard of acting and production - I wasn't wrong.

Evan Peters is chilling at Jeff Dahmer. I read somewhere that Peters has to take long breaks after filming with Murphy as the characters he often plays are so dark, twisted & vile.... And boy, he plays them so well.

He'll probably have to take a year off after this one... the first episode alone was terrifying!!

Really looking forward to binging the rest of this one.

***update*** now on episode 6 and well and truly invested in this show, it is GRIPPING. Bravo to Ryan Murphy for casting real Deaf actors in this episode. They were incredible :)"
7.0,30 November 2022,"So I almost skipped this because after 2 episodes the story went into gumby mode. If they're getting paid by the video frames I get it but imo they could have produced this in half or a third of the celluloid. Seriously, never thought serial killing could be boring until watching this. Mr Peters is great at his craft and the resemblance is there but this is a fairly one sided character in shallow waters. Most of it is boiler plate, ""sorry dad"" stuff. But most annoying is the ham fisted message that dahmer wasn't caught because he was white. Little mister privileged serial killer who could have been caught so many times if he'd just been born with a different colored skin. I guess the producers never heard of kermit gosnell. How did this guy manage to run his ""house of horrors"" for so long and never get caught except executive privilege. And the producers never sat on the jury I did. The case involved 2 young black men accused of passing bad checks at a bank. The one that actually committed the crime wasn't on trial, but rather turned up to testify for the state and the prosecutor made a point of stating over and over that this young black man came from a good family. His dad, a high ranking police officer and hs mother an administrator with social services. What's that word, 'privilege'. Again, the young black man on the witness stand is the one who committed the crime, and not the one facing the judge. The producers never sat on this jury or listened to 3 days of testimony as the prosecutor laid out the timeline. So what kind of defense did the young black man's attorney put on, who btw was also black. None, nada, nothing. No testimony, no rebuttal, no alternate theories. Just, ""your honor, I rest"". Then in summation when his attorney asked to borrow the multimedia materials the prosecutor put together, I was pretty much dumbfounded and sorry for the defendant but 30 mins to deliberate by a mostly white/brown/not black jury and another young man goes to jail; yeah I felt sorry for him but I also felt he was guilty. Not ironically, I was invited to exactly the same scenario many years later but fortunately I was able to be excused before I had send another black youth to prison. So while the producers might see everything in racial terms, from my personal experience, it's something else entirely. Otherwise how do you explain felony assault on live tv in front of millions of people and not a whiff of prosecution afterwards. And what's up with the guy who killed dahmer in prison. Maybe they should do season 2 all about him; bet it would be a lot more interesting.

Also, molly ringwald, michael learned, love their work but man do I feel old now."
3.0,1 October 2022,"Wow! TH was that? I'd only heard of the name, and known that Jeffery Dahmer was serial killer but I didn't know anything else, this turned out to be a ""You need to watch this to believe it!"" kinda story. *smh* The 10ep show, not a movie/doc, is a recreation based on true events and it's about the origins, the period itself, and the fallout of all of the murders carried out by Jeff Dahmer. While doing so, it also throws light on various societal issues because of which these murders continued to happen.

BRILLIANT acting by the Evan Peters and several of the supporting cast, I won't be surprised if this one show sweeps away all of the awards.

Parts of show aren't for the faint hearted, this will make you feel a certain way and you might have to take a break before you move on to the next episode. There are several Dahmer shows out there, I don't know how good they are, but this one is definitely top quality story telling."
9.0,19 September 2024,
8.0,26 September 2022,"That's how Jeffrey Dahmer, a man who slaughtered, cut up (and often ate) 17 young men sums up his arrest and indictment. Like many people, I knew the headline of Dahmer's story but little else. This dramatization, starring the great Evan Peters shows the story from the victim's perspective which I found very compelling. In these stories of mass murder, society rarely gets an opportunity to understand the human beings that suffered the most. Sure, we get their stories, but their inner personalities, lives, dreams and motivations in life are never really known.

It's very well done, yes hard to watch, but masterfully directed (four episodes of Season One were directed by Jennifer Lynch). Niecy Nash, always superb, plays Glenda Cleveland, one of Dahmer's neighbors who (in vain) begged the cops to investigate bizarre screams, buzz saws, and the stench coming from Dahmer's apartment. As her character states, ""For years I told you to do something and you did NOTHING."" Nash is simply superb in this role.

Stories are told from at least 10 instances where this monster was nearly caught but time after time, released. Inept cops and judges that give him a pass are simply astounding. So if the father, who makes everything about him.

As always, Richard Jenkins delivers a perfect performance (as the senior Dahmer) Molly Ringwald, Penelope Ann Miller and Michael Learned skillfully play other Dahmer women.

Once again, we have another story of police not being held accountable. The ineptitude of cops and judges is shocking."
8.0,4 October 2024,
10.0,21 September 2024,"I would like to say the acting is unreal and I did get sucked into the show HOWEVER! It's not accurate in the way they portrayed what was going on. If you do even the slightest of research you'll in no way ever find any indication that the brothers had anything for each other than brotherly care. I have a many feelings about this director and what he did in this show. Not okay. The SA these boys experienced was horrendous and they deserved more then what the show gave and presented them as. The fact that they didn't consult with the brothers on this show just makes it so much worse. If they could have captured this show using the boys voices, it would be a different story."
7.0,22 September 2022,"The very first episode is some of the most intense television I have ever watched. Starting off in reverse, I was a bit unsure but as it developed it just got more and more extreme.

Evan Peters does a brilliant job as always, I feel like he is one of the most underrated actors of our time but glad to see he continues to work with Ryan Murphy on some iconic television, Pose was brilliant. I genuinely have not seen a premier episode that hit the mark as this one did. It is definitely not easy viewing and many may struggle with the gore and the level of violence that is depicted. Onward to episode two."
8.0,22 September 2022,"Evan Peters makes an amazing performance, first and foremost. He depicts Dahmer very well, down to the smallest details. HOWEVER....what kills this show, is when it starts to move away from the subject matter (Dahmer) and begins to focus more on black empowerment, and like so many shows/movies today, the ""woke"" agenda. It gives you the feeling as you get later in the show that this was funded by Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, and Black Lives Matter. Utter garbage after Episode 6. You can save yourself time and just watch until then. The rest of the show had no focus on him and became intolerable."
6.0,28 September 2022,"The series is good and the main character plays his role engrossingly well. The path to become a deranged serial killer is depicted rather well. However, I think there could have been more details on how he had become the monster that he was. My gripe is the amount of time wasted on Glenda and the black community and the victims, which deviated from the main theme of what caused him to become such a dangerous psychopath. The time wasted on Glenda (specifically) could have been spent on how he stalked his victims and how he buried them and the opinion of doctors on how he was what he was. And, at the end of the series, I do not know why but I felt pity for him. He was born with that monsterous attitude."
10.0,29 September 2022,"This series was truly eye opening on the ache the families and the victims endured. If anything, I appreciate this series for sharing the stories of the victims like Tony. It is not often the victims are remembered but the monster that plagued them. For the first time I truly felt so much anger and heartbreak over the victims and their loved ones and never once was comfortable in watching this series. No one should be. Knowing a little bit more about the victims gave me some acceptance this series even exists. I can't ever imagine how the families of the lives lost must feel about this. If anything, I got to learn at least a little bit about who the victims were and it will be hard to forget them after this."
7.0,26 September 2022,"I watched the series Black Bird just before I watched Dahmer, and even though it's not fair to compare the two series, Black bird was so intens and I didn't get bored one minute of it. Dahmer doesn't hold my attention all the time, and I think they should have had less episodes. They jump weirdly back and forth in time as well which is a little confusing. Netflix manage to make an very insane and interesting story boring. That being said, the actors are amazing and because of them I managed to watch all 10 episodes and give this show a 7. The way Netflix tell the story only deserves a 5 at max."
1.0,30 September 2022,"Incredibly disturbing and gut-wrenching to watch, this rather different portrayal of the Jeffrey Dahmer story makes it the best of what there already is. Despite what you already know about this very gritty case and the movies or documentaries you've seen on it throughout the years, this series won't fail to leave you deeply disturbed but truly stunned. There are some common factual errors, but there's a lot that covers it, such as excellent performances from Evan Peters whose made to look just like the serial killer, as well as bloody fantastic work from supporting actors Richard Jenkins and Niecy Nash. The way this series tells Jeffrey Dahmer's story is incredibly unique and very admirable as well, by focusing on the killer's monstrous backstory and upbringing, the murder victims themselves and the loved ones or others surrounding the Jeffrey Dahmer case, all whilst frequently jumping back and forth in time. There is some really good tension in the first episode, followed by a later episode that's almost completely silent as it looks through the eyes of a deaf victim, and some very disturbing scenes that'll make you want to look away. It's also worth noting that this series doesn't glamourise the monster or other serial killers, as it just portrays the story in an extremely tough, yet powerful way.

8.0,24 September 2024,"I don't usually review the shows that I watch but, having followed the Menendez Brothers' case over the years, seeing as I was only a child when it actually happened, I feel that Ryan Murphy took a lot of liberties when it came to writing their story to screen. I feel that Mr Murphy took a lot of creative liberties especially when it came to the dynamics of the brothers and their closeness. I don't believe they Erik and Lyle were, at any point in their lives, in an incestuous relationship, like what was being hinted at during the nine episode run.

The acting was top notch, cinematography was amazing and you really felt like both the leads did the story justice. I just wish there was less of the cliche, fantasy of brothers being ""in love"" and more about their childhood and what actually took place that led up to the August 1989 shootings."
9.0,26 September 2022,"Dahmer is one of those shows which, once you start, you're hard pressed to stop until the end. I watched it in two 5-episode sessions over two days, and everything about it was excellent! The atmosphere of dread and filth, the haunting theme song, and the continued unpredictability carries the story from start to finish. The crimes themselves aren't even the ""star"" of the show as much as the acting, writing, and constant tension wondering what will happen next. Have I mentioned the acting is top notch?

Having never heard the Jeffrey Dahmer story, everything was new to me. But after looking up some details and interviews afterwords, the facts seem to be accurately portrayed here.

Not for the faint of heart, I highly recommend this show to anyone interested in a worthy telling of the Jeffrey Dahmer story."
8.0,11 October 2022,"So, the early episodes are dramatically very strong, if you can manage the non-chronological storytelling. All the acting is top-notch and characters are well developed.

For the writers, I wonder if they think we are empty vessels, waiting to be filled with hit-over-head Social Justice narratives? The semi-fictional reimagining of the (nevertheless highly commendable) neighbour Glenda Cleveland, who did not live in the same building as Dahmer, is just the beginning. The real adjacent neighbours, the Bass's, are written out as I guess they did not fit the narrative. The two cops who failed to act on Ms Cleveland's phone call, were not given an award.

My sense now is that, at least for a generation, all US-produced drama will now be part entertainment and part activist lesson-telling. And therefore, more than ever, viewers will need to see such ""based on true story"" drama as just that - ""based on"" then embellished or fictionalised. Maybe it always was. Just that 20 years ago, the embellishments were for dramatic purposes, and now they are to educate us on Social Justice.

So watch the series, then read the fact-check articles and think for yourself. How much was Dahmer ""allowed"" to commit his crime by racists cops? Was his choice of victims racist? These are legitimate questions, but the show alone is not enough to form a rounded view."

I am in favour or Murphys previous work however I've found the more recent stuff to be low quality or hit and miss at best but this is redemption in my eyes. Dahmer has a completely different feel from the all previous shows. The tension builds nicely from the start and it heavily depends on the story telling by not going for cheap thrills and keeping the gore to a minimum. Implied violence, great dialogue and non-linear timeline make it gripping. The cast turn in solid performance's and Evan Peters is as consistent as ever. Definitely worth your time."

8.0,1 October 2022,"Richard Jenkins and Evan Peters are fantastic in this dark and intriguing recreation of Dahmer's evil yet sad life. A must watch for anyone interested in serial killers or Jeffery Dahmer.

Episodes 1 to 5 are binge worthy and captivating. It's 6 onwards the reality unfortunately becomes fiction and we get back to the 2022 everything has to push a political narrative. In this case like many others a false narrative. Skip episode 7 entirely and you'd of done yourself a favour. Facts of history are changed to push the point of view that Dahmer was allowed to carry on because of racism in the police force.

Reality is most serial killers could of been stopped earlier even those that only killed white people believe it or not. If the police hadn't made mistakes during their investigations. Anyone that knows anything on the subject will be aware of this. It's unfortunate that the police are only human. Mistakes are made. And it's not always about skin colour.

This show could of been a solid 10 for me if they left the laughable false racism narrative at the door and just focused on Dahmer's life. It's an 8 for episode 1-5. Would of been a 10 overall if 6-10 weren't partly fiction."
7.0,20 November 2022,"Dahmer is a well made series. It is shockingly accurate and does not spare its audience from the disturbing murders that happened. Evan Peters steals the show in this series and is the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer from his voice, mannerisms and acting. His portrayal is so accurate it is creepy and dark watching Jeffrey in action. From the first episode we are given a dark window into the life of this serial killer and it is beyond disturbed. The timeline and pacing is interesting, they start off with him getting caught and work backwards from that event. This works nicely. You feel sympathy and sadness for his victims but not Jeffrey, he is pure evil.

My only criticisms would be I felt Netflix could have shortened this by an episode or two. The heart of the show was his awful deeds which then could have been wrapped up in 2 further episodes. So 8 episodes overall instead of dragging it out to 10. We didn't need to see an episode devoted to Glenda, they already gave her plenty of screen time. Overall not a bad series and I can see why it got so much attention. Disturbing, shocking but well acted. 7.5/10."
2.0,25 November 2022,"My review has no spoilers, I will just let you know how I feel about this show. This show is a special one, there is so much attention to detail! I've seen all the movies that have been released about Jeffrey Dahmer but none was as good, as accurate and as passionate as this show. Peters was absolutely convincing as Jeffrey Dahmer, giving some extraordinary performances. What you will see in the show is not a 100% accurate but most things are actually based on the real events, which makes the show much more intense, brutal, tragic and dramatic, sometimes you will get a horror vibe. This show is not for everyone, only adults who can stomach this kind of theme should watch it!

While there is pretty much no gore in the show it still is very dark and many times it will make you feel sick, to me responsible for that is mostly Evan Peters and his performance but all the other actors do an amazing job as well. Many shows and movies have tried to get inside the head of a monster/psychopath but they fail. Well this show actually did it successfully! You will feel like you are inside Dahmer's head, you will be able to see the world the way he sees the world. Evan Peters proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. All the people involved did an amazing job. This is a definitely a show worth binge-watching. My rating is 8.5/10."
10.0,3 February 2023,You have the real life Dr. Hannibal and instead of making an interesting 6 episode masterpiece you stretch it into 10 episodes. Dahmer in some of the late episodes felt like a guest star. I don't know if it was accidental or not but the slow rhythm and the direction of the last 2 episodes I felt there was compassion from the show runners towards the monster and the way they presented his baptism it felt like they telling us the monster is dead and this is a new person. This is not fair to the families of the victims. This show should have been fast and gruesome leaving you disgusted by the monster and almost giving you an heart attack.
10.0,1 October 2022,"Let's start right off the bat that stating Evan Peters better get some sort of award for His performance because he is flat out brilliant. I remember being 11 or 12 years old when all of this unfolded, still creeps me out.

The producer is Ryan Murphy the person that created American Horror story. It has that same creepiness the show had until the last few season which have been incredibly disappointing. The attention to detail is phenomenal along with a great supporting cast. Good move by releasing this around Halloween too, I myself tend to gravitate towards the Genre during the spooky season.

Defiantly worth the watch unless you are faint of heart because he eats a few.... Enjoy!"
10.0,4 October 2022,"True It's very well done and realistic which makes it all the more disturbing even though some unnecessary liberties were taken.

STORY The story is about Jeff Dahmer a conficted serial killer who was genuine brutal in these heinous acts. Mostly it's real, although the well spoken real Jeff as seen in his interviews is barely visible mostly we see an awkward TV version of him with fitting dialogue.

ANALYSIS It's a chilling but very interesting watch that dives into the backstory of Jeff. A viewer discretion warning seems appropriate here. But for those that are continuing after the somewhat shocking events of the first episode a true gripping story awaits. The first episode is near perfection. But it ads a lot of made up family dialogue in the following episodes. Towards the last 2-3 episodes, the series tries to reinvent itself and turn into a civil rights discussion. Whilst the topics being inserted are important topics, the way that it is done feels abrupt and bolted on as and afterthought. It also speaks on another infamous person on the end which reminds me of the inclusion of the Nun and the Crooked Man in horror franchises by Warner Bros. A service to the network to plug for another series.

Acting: 10/10 all actors are doing really well. Evan Peters as the titular role's performance is award worthy for its screenplay, even though it lacks the easy talking elements that the real Dahmer has show in recordings and interviews..

Visuals/Costumes (Decor): 9/10 very 90s the outfits take you back to the era.

Musical Score: the background goes really well with the atmosphere. Aside from that make hits from the era are accompanying the scenes and characters which

Liberties taken: there a lot of emphasis on Jeffs obsession with meat, and less on his human side. It is a though balance to make when producing anything on the topic. Humanizing the perpetrator whilst many people fell victim to horrible crimes.

Jeffrey is totally awkward throughout, only in the 6th episode we get the see a more balanced view. In real life there are videos of him being well spoken which explains better how guys were falling for him. Also when it comes to the activities that happened in the bathhouses the amount in real life are much higher. Some of the scenes are almost exactly copied from what happened, whilst some facts like the neighbour lady living next door instead of in another building are made up, this also applied to some of the stories of the victims.

It seems like the reality would have been enough in these situations.

End word: Netflix is here to entertain and make money. And there is a big of an ethical question that will probably always arise when we speak about productions on real life horror stories of murders. But at the end of the day. These stories will find there way to the public and at least in this format the story is told well.

As much as it has something disturbing about it. The story will make it's way to the public. And this story seem more complete then people hearing only details. And for that I will recommend it to anyone intrigued by the topic. Just one final warning, it's really not for the fainthearted ones amongst us. Just whenever you think you are just watching the story unfold 'stuff' happens. And if you really want to figure out the true story, watch a documentary on it on YouTube or elsewhere. With these series we can hope the last media about the person has seen light."
7.0,17 October 2022,"The whole episode feels like they needed to fill an episode, just so they could milk as many episodes as possible.

They do a really bad job of making you feel sympathetic to the victims, although you can tell they're trying so hard, to the point where they had to embellish the story. No need to do that. Just tell the story accurately, so someone can watch this ten years from now and this would still feel relevant.

I'm not sure why Netflix can't just produce a historically accurate series. Every movie/show now seems to have some sort of political or social justice agenda to it, which wouldn't be bad if they weren't so obviously obscured by rewiring history as being reflected through the lens of the current political climate, rather than what would've been the past or future standard."
10.0,16 October 2022,
7.0,26 September 2022,"Even Peters will surely be recognized for his portrayal of Dahmer for years to come. He was a perfect balance of creepiness and impenetrability, leaving us constantly sickened but thoroughly intrigued. Every moment in this series was riveting, carefully planned, and meticulously portrayed. Scene after scene artfully captured the essence of a time without social media, when life in certain communities was so lax and obscure that such crimes could go unnoticed. We feel pity for some characters who don't necessarily deserve our sympathy, while being completely enveloped in sadness for others. Count on seeing several well-earned awards handed out for this one in the near future."
10.0,1 October 2022,"Love it or hate it - serial killers are always going to be fascinating to some people.

What makes them that way? Are they insane? What did they actually do?

We are human, we want to know... I understand that technically this was not that long ago and families of the victims are reacting strongly to this series.

I do believe this was one of the better bio pics of a serial killer. I also feel that the way we were introduced and educated about some of his victims back stories was a very brave thing to do, it also added to the whole trauma of the series.

Whether you like it or not Dahmer is and always will be an historical figure. Not all historical figures are good ones, and it is from history that we learn.

We can't strike their existence from history as much as some might want too.

The acting in this series is superb.

And I have to admit that yes at times I felt bad for Dahmer. No body asks to be born that way = completely soulless.

If you want to learn more about Dahmer and the atrocities he committed ( be warned they did take some liberties with this, some of it is not factual) then you should be engrossed in this series.

I hope Murphy does a Gacey one next."
7.0,2 October 2022,"Probably 4 episodes too many. Episodes of conjecture and guess work about what people may have thought or felt. I found these filler episodes took so much away from the story. Anyone knows these dramatizations just move away from facts. I believe the parts about Dahmer, his family and his acts were mostly accurate and made for a good series. I'd give some episodes an 8.5/9 but overall I had to settle for a 7 to make up for the filler episodes. It's what I expect from someone trying to sell commercials. I don't mind some of the liberties taken such as Ms Cleveland living in the same building as Dahmer although we know she didn't. If this had been 6 episodes I'd probably rate it a 9. Halfway through I was sorry I started it because it's so sluggish. Do yourself a favour and just read the Wikipedia page."
1.0,23 September 2022,"Well....... If you think Evan Peters can be messed up in American horror universe wait till you get through this. He truly is at his disturbing finest in the portrayal of Jeffery Dahmer. This is probably the best telling of any serial killer ever made, a real eye opener into the mind of the epitome of the deranged and psychotic. I would recommend holding off wiki or googling Dahmer before finishing this, enjoy the series and be prepared to say WTH a lot during this. There are also some great acting from some great actors and actresses ie Jenkins, Miller, Ringwald etc. Expect awards for this series."
10.0,3 October 2024,"Another rehash of The Menendez Brothers! The mini-series was unnecessarily long and retreads the same material after episode 5 which was the shortest and best episode between Erik and his lawyer. Producer Ryan Murphy took a good stab at this however with a top-rated cast: Javier Bardem, Chloe Sevigny, and Dallas Roberts. Two newcomers, Cooper Koch (Erik) and Nick Chavez (Lyle) did a stellar acting job as the brothers as well as Ari Graynor (Leslie Abramson). The emphasis on Nathan Lane's character added little substance. The sexual abuse part of their story was important to cover no matter how explicit it was. There was a lot more to the trials that was left out and the ending was rather anti-climactic. In comparison to Monsters: Season 1: Dahmer, Season 2 was tiresome and repetitive with 9 episodes. But there will be a Season 3 with Charlie Hunnam as Ed Gein to try telling another Monsters story. Can't wait."
8.0,26 September 2022,"I won't simply repeat what is being said here by far better reviewers, but yes, Evan Peters deserves an Emmy for this, only because the show is not eligible for the Academy Awards. The other characters were all real. I didn't see anyone ""acting."" The show is creepy, disturbing, and frightening, even if you know the story, and I do.

Suffice to say that I was 20 years old in 1978, a part of the gay community in Chicago, and remember this entire case quite well. Jeffrey Dahmer was EXACTLY as you see him on screen in this series -- Peters nailed it to a fault. Those here saying that he appeared to be an automaton, or stupidly, he had no character arc, WAS Dahmer. He had very little human affect to him. He was robotic, and although I won't try to place blame, in hindsight, his mother's drug use during pregnancy may have been a contributing factor, and his father didn't really come around to being demonstrative with Jeffrey until after his crimes were found out, but again, no actual blame to either of them for what Jeffrey Dahmer did. He did what he did all on his own.

The writers were not kind to anyone except the people that tried to expose and stop Dahmer before he was finally caught. The Milwaukee police of 1991 were taken down handily, and although that Officers of the Year ceremony didn't happen, it merely drives home the fact that the police homophobia and AIDSaphobia, and blatant racism contributed A LOT to Dahmer being able to have the killing spree he did.

I highly recommend this series, but make sure you have 10 hours free because it's doubtful you'll be able to break away from it once you start. Although I didn't find any ""wokeness"" in this series, if you happen to be one of those red-pillers, you might, because you'll be looking for it. Don't do that. It's not really there. Calling something ""woke"" is code for ""this makes me feel uncomfortable because I know it's all true, and that makes me feel icky, but I'm not allowed to show it."" Everything is not a comic book. Everything is not some trope from a popular movie series. Some things are just simply true no matter how much you wish they weren't."
9.0,15 October 2024,"As Episode 1 of ""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story (2024 release; 9 episodes ranging 35 to 65 min each) opens, Lyle and Erik arrive in a limo at the memorial service of they parents, Jose and Kitty, who were brutally murdered in Belaire. We then are in ""1989"", two months later, and Erik, the younger of the two, confesses to the murders when meeting with his shrink... At this point we are 10 minutes into Episode 1.

Couple of comments: this mini-series comprises Season 2 of ""Monster"", created by Ryan Murphy. I did not watch Season 1 (""The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"") but Season 2 came up in conversation over lunch with a friend, and he told me how much he is enjoying this. So I gave it a try, and SURPRISE (not!), I liked this quite a bit. In fact, I was very surprised how much it turns out I didn't know about what went down with the Menedez brothers. Javier Bardem and Chloey Sevigny are masterful in their roles as the parents. Nicolas Alexander Chavez (as Lyle) and Cooper Koch are an outright revelation (at least for me), and surely we have not seen the last of them. Check out in particular Episode 5, which features a wide-tanging discussion between Erik and his lawyer lasting about 35 minutes, and filmed in one uninterrupted single take.

""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" started streaming on Netflix last month, but as mentioned, I'm just now catching up on it. If you are a fane of true crime series, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your conclusion."
8.0,8 October 2022,"It doesn't matter how well-crafted or well acted a show is. None of that matters when the show revolves around the martyrization of one of the most repulsive people on Earth.

Film is supposed to serve a purpose, and this show serves none other than motivating people like Dahmer to take action on their ill fantasies: ""Look at this guy, he's just like me and they made a whole Netflix show about him... maybe I'm not so weird after all.""

Anyone mentally sane will get no benefit from watching this show. We all know mental illness is a thing, we all know bad parenting is bad. We don't need a necrophile cannibal to teach us. While people like Jeffrey Dahmer should simply be forgotten, not only does the show remind the world he existed (I'd never heard of him before), but it goes as far as making him look like the victim. Almost as if you, the viewer, should feel guilty for being part of that same society that made him who he was.

To add insult to injury, the victims' real names weren't changed, and it appears that the victims' families weren't even notified about the show's production, let alone asked for permission to use their names and likeness for a profit, which I think is borderline illegal.

Just disgusting."

10.0,22 September 2022,"Very Hard to watch. Almost had to look away in the beginning cause it's very tense. Guess the fact the actually lived in Milwaukee (unusual high amount of Serial killer come from this place). ...Hits a nerve. Netflix pretty much outdone themselves this time. Probably win something for this. So far watched 1-4. ...which explains how he was captured, the initial ineptitude of law enforcement, and how he became to like his killing obsession.

Evan Peters (plays Jeff) and Richard Jenkins (plays Lionel which is Jeff's dad). ...Supposed a combined of his parents, his Mom taking drugs while pregnant(plus she was weird too), Inability define himself sexually, his obsession with killing early on and no real direction in his life. ...plus his other multiple obsessions include relating intimacy with tons of other things. ...but it was this and Alcohol that did him in. Hate to mention white privilege helped him a bit, but in the end his Obsessions became his weaknesses."
7.0,26 September 2022,"Enjoyed all 10 episodes tremendously! All characters were cast well. Evan Peters as always, phenomenal and Nicey Nash, what can I say! The time taken to cover not only Dahmer but the people around him, the victims and families was not only vital but heartbreaking. The victimization, discrimination, racism by those who should have been protecting the community. A stellar cast telling a gruesome, horrific story, with care and attention to details but not glorifying to Dahmer actions.

Would be interested in watching more series like this on people who've had a jarring impact on our society and where it takes us."

5.0,28 September 2022,"It started well. First episode was quite good, it keeps you very tense all the time, it gives you a claustrophobic feeling. The second one was fine, but way slower. On the third one I caught myself too many times watching my phone, wishing for the episode to be over already. The solution was to watch it in 1.5x. This was the game changer for me. It became a perfectly paced show once i speeded it up.

Apparently I'm an exception here, because everybody seem to love it at it's original pace. But this is waaaay to slow for me.

So, unless you're a huge fun of extremely low paced slow-burn genre, i suggest speeding it up, and then you'll have a great experience with the show."
8.0,22 September 2022,"This was a really tough watch at times but ultimately a really well done depiction of the horrors committed by Jeffrey Dahmer. Knowing the story there was some stuff left out but you get the idea. For me, Niecy Nash delivers a powerhouse performance that I was not expecting from her. Although I am aware of her work I didn't know she had these acting chops! Give her ALL the awards. Evan Peters also gives another great performance as expected. This story really is the stuff of nightmares, especially where Glenda is concerned. True crime lovers will enjoy this but anyone who appreciates fantastic acting will too. 10/10."
8.0,22 September 2022,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is a 10 episodes Netflix mini-series about Jeffrey Dahmer. Dahmer is easily in the top 10 most interesting serial killers. A very complex man and his prison interview was fascinating.

This is the third non-documentary movie/series I'm seeing about Jeffrey Dahmer and I think it's fair to say it's the most accurate. Evan Peters is doing a very good job as Dahmer and the production gave a lot of attention to details. I still don't understand why it's jumping back and forth in time instead of just telling his story in chronological order.

6/10 Recommended."
10.0,22 September 2022,"I actually screamed when my cat jumped up on the couch as I was watching this. The episode is taut and terrifying from the first moment. The code cinematography is perfect. The score adds an eerie element that ups the intensity. I was so scared, worrying about which part of Dahmer's story I'd be watching. Tense is a perfect descriptor of the mood for the majority of this episode.

Evan Peters is brilliant once again. Can't wait to see the rest although I'm worried about what else they will show. I've read a lot of Dahmer, nothing compares to this. Wow! I hope it doesn't fizzle out as AHS is wont to do."
7.0,22 September 2022,
8.0,21 September 2022,"My initial rating based on episode 1 was a 9; but now that I've seen them all my opinion has changed significantly.

If I had to rate the show itself, at least my by IMDb show standards, it would be somewhere between a 7 and 8. The only good reason to watch this is to see Richard Jenkins' performance as Dahmer's father, because it's some incredible acting.

The show itself is so... confused. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. On one hand it's trying to appeal to true crime fans that want to watch and hear about the most lurid and disgusting stuff imaginable. It wants to be a show about the philosophical implications of a person like Dahmer even existing. It wants to talk about the psychological conditions that bring about people like him. And it wants to do some social commentary about the police, racial issues.

As you can imagine, it does none of this, because it doesn't have a focus. So what you've got is the first half that just feels like a personal story of Dahmer's, and the second which is like some boring, cliched drama about the families and the fallout of what's happened.

As other reviews were asking, what is the purpose of this story? Was it to cover Dahmer? That's been done before, and it's not like it appeals to such a huge audience. Was it to explore philosophical questions of good and evil or maybe talk about policing issues in some places? Probably way better cases you could work with if that's your intent.

The reason I'm giving it a 5 rather than a 7 is because the moral messages this show conveys aren't just twisted, they're also hypocritical. It celebrates Dahmer's death at the hand of some lunatic as if that's some great deed. It tries to say that it's a bad thing that some stupid comic featuring Dahmer wasn't banned, even as this show VERY GRATUITOUSLY depicts the killing of his real victims. Like, what?... It's pretending to be this respectful quasi-documentary that's imparting valuable lessons when it's anything but. It's damning what a hubristic view these creators have of themselves.

Should you watch this? Not really. Any scenes worth your time will probably be on Youtube, and the whole package is not worth the 10h investment. There's nothing to learn here and nothing to gain."
6.0,1 October 2022,"If there is one thing to be said straight away about this series it was definitely a sinister and disturbing one. None the less its hard to find anything you can fault it on other then it wasn't necessarily %100 accurate, but for what its worth it hits the nail on the head. Not one actor felt out of place, everyone who played a serious role came off legitimate and believable. While Molly Ringwald is not in it as much she still plays her role respectively. Niecy Nash does a fantastic job as Glenda Cleveland and Richard Jenkins drives it home as Lional Dahmer, I would go as far to say he deserves a supporting actors nomination of sorts. Now who really brings home the bacon of course is none other then Evan Peters, definitely playing one of the best representations of someone in real life to cinema for 2022. This play by play documentary to limited Tv series is hands down a must watch and I would highly recommend it."
10.0,23 October 2022,"With a degree in psychology, I've studied cases like Dahmer's and seen many of the docs offered. My first reaction is this series wants to focus on all the minutia from the first nflx doc where they interviewed the paralegal who recorded all those audio tapes. It follows it pretty closely and actually is not as gruesome, focusing more on the interaction with the victims. I hope they paid Peters a very high salary for not only accepting this role but for his amazing performance.

I feel the film focuses too much on some details that we can ascertain in 45 seconds instead of 3 min. But that's part of the new normal in psychological drama.

My biggest complaint is the extreme focus on Glenda and the unfortunate use of Nash, who comes off as a comedian no matter what the character she plays.

I noticed a lot of reviews claim it turns into libiberal fest (can't use tribigerber words here anymore). But having lived in that time -- in fact being born the same year as Dhamer -- I can say this depicts true situations. I've seen a lot of feedback on films claiming they insert things when really it's just depicting the times. Especially since this is a true story, it is depicting actual events that were, unfortunately, much more common than just this situation.

A psych student states that Dahmer was ill, not evil and I have to strongly disagree that there's any difference. It's common for those studying human psychology to mix up the fact that one deserves compassion with the idea that they were not intentionally evil. Law enforcement and the courts do make the differentiation of whether one understood their actions were illegal, and that definition is not a psychological definition, that's true. We can recognize that Hitler, Stalin, and Bin Laden were just humans struggling with some physical or environmental deficiencies or imposed beliefs but the acts they committed were still evil; whether in the psychological or biblical sense could be up for debate.

And speaking of environmental, Dahmer's environment is not what caused this. Many kids grow up shooting and skinning animals and they don't kill people. But many children do have enormous emotional and psychological trauma from neglect by a parent. Severe abuse includes neglect/lack of bonding or touching and causes a child to withdraw and numb while still craving human interaction. These are the ingredients for a psychopath. Less than 2% of psychopaths become serial killers. Some believe diet can actually help but that's probably 20 years out when society understands the effects of food on self-control and mood/behavior.

Overall a good watch but did fall off the rails the last few episodes like there was a different writer; way too much focus on Glenda with borderline comical acting from Nash. This may be why some viewers feel there was a bent toward focusing on the lack of response from the LE. But in fairness, Glenda did continuously try to get someone over to investigate.

Peters and all the victims were amazing. I can't imagine trying to play these parts."
7.0,8 October 2022,"It niggled me throughout the show who Evans' portrayal reminded me of. Then, at the end of episode nine, that dead-eyed thousand yard stare triggered something - I has to pause, and finally it hit me. Peter Gibbons from Office Space. That weird, post-hypnotic trancey way of talking is exactly the same!

Also, great seeing Penelope Ann Miller (the teacher from Kindergarten Cop) as his mum. I had a crash on her as a kid. Not so much now.

In the first five episodes I was craving more of a backstory to a victim to balance it a little and build empathy. Episode 6 felt like it had heard me (although Tony probably wouldn't have). I do feel that the show tipped it's creepier, more compelling elements into the first half for the sake of that Netflix style addictive engagement, the latter episodes steer a bit too much into ""well, then this stuff happened I guess"" territory. But it's all interesting, just in different ways."
8.0,16 October 2022,"Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant in portraying the monster Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered 17 men and often ate their flesh as well. Absolutely sick and disgusting. It also makes me angry how Glenda and the others got ignored by the police. Acting is really top-notch, and I'm also impressed by Richard Jenkins (who played Dahmer's dad), Niecy Nash (who played Glenda) and Rodney Burford (who played Tony Hughes). That Tony episode is so depressing and, in my personal opinion, the best episode of the series.

The timeline shifts a lot, so things can be a little bit confusing unless you already know a lot about the Dahmer case, which I don't. The last two episodes are okay. I wish they just skipped the ninth episode, which in my opinion is unnecessary.

I recommend this."
10.0,21 September 2024,"The actor who plays 'the younger brother' Eric seems to be an older and much more mature person than the actor cast as 'the older brother' Lyle. I can understand casting the best person/actor/talent for the job to a degree (which I would say they did with Eric) but when there's supposed to be a dynamic of older brother/younger vulnerable brother which is based on real life events, it is awkward in my opinion to cast an obviously older actor as the younger brother. I looked up the ages of the actors and I'm correct. The 2 of them are very good in their performances however, Eric in particular. Overall talented cast and acting. Extremely heavy subject matter(s) which can be upsetting and triggering. Side note, the shrink reminds me of John Ritter."
8.0,24 October 2022,"Overall this show is great and well-made. It has great acting, a compelling story, great casting.

But I don't understand why they insist on so many shows being shown out of order nowadays. This series would have been so much better if it was told in chronological order. Instead, it felt like they took a bunch of clips of the show, shuffled the order up, and showed them to you in a random order. It drove me absolutely crazy. It got to the point where I was constantly lost about where we were in the story's chronology, trying to piece together what happened when. And the first episode gave away the ending immediately, so instead of wondering how it would play out and where it was going the rest of the show was just like filling in gaps.

I suspect so many shows are done this way now so that they can try to hook you with something really compelling by telling you the most interesting in the first episode. That way you don't start to watch it and give up. But it really ruins the show."

7.0,4 October 2022,"Don't usually go for shows like this. BUT ..... heard a lot of interesting reviews about how good it was. Gave it a go.. and WOW. I was hooked. Watched 5 episodes in 1 viewing. It's amazing.... the acting is stunning. And really is gripping throughout. Each episode is interesting and very watchable!! Very very interesting and worth a watch for sure!!!!

It gives a lot of information about Jeffrey Dahmer and the things that he did ... I can't believe what he got away with! The show really does replicate (as close as possible) to what actually happened and it really is shocking what a human can even do..... and what people have suffered from his doings!!

Evan Peters gave a magnificent performance ... He should definitely get an award for his acting.

Watch it! You will be hooked! For all the wrong reasons.. and good reasons too!! 👍🏼👍🏼"
10.0,23 September 2022,"I enjoyed this show, however I'm just not sold on the robotic and monotonous performance by Evan Peters. Statements from the neighbors and acquaintances of Jeffrey Dahmer describe him as someone who appears normal. Evan Peters in his role as Jeffrey Dahmer on the other hand, comes across as a complete creep from the very first sentence. The slow deliverance of his lines without showing any kind of emotion is just not how a normal person would speak, and I highly doubt someone would be able to convince so many people to come over to his place by speaking in that manner.

However, the different viewpoints from victims and neighbors keep the show interesting in my opinion, albeit a little slow at times. Overall not bad, not great, but merely okay."
7.0,5 October 2022,"It's brilliant in so many ways. Peter's and his father are particular acting standouts.

I hate to say it but this is 2 different shows. The first 6 eps are some of the best television I've seen in years. Dark, brutal and in many ways real. Episode 6 on its own is a masterpiece - watch it.

Ep 7-10 is a overcooked, netflix central trying to give to much emotion, focusing on side characters when they audience get it and doesn't need to be told how other people feel. That part is obvious. It would have had much more impact 2-3 eps less.

Less is more. But other than this, it's a deeply impressive series."

6.0,2 October 2024,"I have no interest in Jeffrey Dahmer, so I didn't watch Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. A series about the Menendez brothers, on the other hand, is something that I want to check out. Thus, this review is focused on Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, and I'm approaching it as if it's a completely separate series-because it should be treated that way, much like The Haunting of Hill House and The Haunting of Bly Manor.

This series was tantalizing, irresistible, and highly entertaining. Ryan Murphy clearly knows how to craft a dynamic story, and he didn't hold back in this well-constructed dramatized account. His intent was to show multiple perspectives and let viewers interpret the crime and its causes for themselves, and he does this beautifully.

Murphy's story-telling approach effectively channeled the sensationalism of the media spectacle surrounding the Menendez trial. The downside, of course, is that this sensationalism often comes at the expense of the real-life tragedy-the victims and their family.

Murphy aside, the cast were the real stars, beginning with Nicholas Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch, who delivered chilling and mesmerizing performances as Lyle and Erik Menendez. However, for me, the standout was Ari Graynor as defense attorney Leslie Abramson. Her portrayal was solid, sharp, and hard-hitting.

All in all, as a piece of entertainment, this series works because of its stellar cast and fascinating storytelling. It's impossible to look away."
3.0,26 March 2024,"It is VERY emotionally tough to sit through at least it was for me. I like so many am interested in true crime but all I knew about this case was he was a cannibal and tried to taxidermy body parts. Also one of his victims who escaped was actually returned to him by the cops. But the performances in this and direction rocked me to my core. I felt deep emotion watching this - there is not a bad performance in it with Evan Peters Nicey Nash and Richard Jenkins being of course the standouts. It really shows the horrible toll violent crime takes on all involved and how the loss of a loved one to crime is devastating.

It's not THAT gory it's just that it's pretty well known what's being shown here.

This is more then just a show it absolutely shook me and I know I'll be thinking about it for a long time."

9.0,30 October 2022,"When the story took place between 1978 and 1991, i was newborn so i don't remember anything heard about it, here in Greece... i learned about it while i started watching the series and at the same time, i was seatching info about it... It's kind of weird to write a review about the series knowing that this truly happened and the victims weren't just actors. They weren't just a role-play. They were real people with loving families, breathing, living, hoping. The main actor's acting was brilliant.. a disturbing person with a lot of external things from the way that he walks, he doesn't move his arms when he walks and talks and his appearance very close to the real one Dahmer... The others did a great job as well. Every episode makes me upset and leaves me feeling depressed due to the way in which a murder is carried out, or even just the downright creepiness surrounding the crime. I am pretty sure it is a descent show, and besides the creepy story it's one more step to eliminate racism. If this was the vibe of 80's and 90's about it, i am happy we are way better nowdays. About the series now episode 6 was a masterpiece i wish they had focus a little bit more to every victim's life the way they did with Tony Hughes. Also i am not fan of the 'now' and 'then' set up at movies or series so i 'd prefer the story was in the right order.. all this forward and backword was confusing.. but despite these two things the show was very good and kind of addictive 'till the end like a horror movie...i still cannot accept that it was all real... crimes happens too in my country too but i can't think of something that cruel..."

6.0,24 September 2022,I was young when the Dahmer Murders happened but I knew what this was based on but after watching this You really find out what kind of monster this man really was Also just how tragic the police police system was in the way those people were treated I went into this around one o'clock at night and I was only gonna watch 1 episode and I ended up watching the whole 10 hour series I could not stop watching it it is 1 of the most Telling stories of one of the world's most notorious serial killers And now I find myself wanting to learn even more and watch even more series like this because it was so interesting.
10.0,1 October 2022,"Not very good and boring. Didnt show anything gruesome or shocking like for example he was raping the victims and eating their hearts but netflix didnt show any of that. It was rated 18, but netflix toned down a lot. With hiding these FACTS from the viewers, Jeff didnt look any more frightening than any other murderer. The show did concentrate way more on the issues of black communities and gay people (hello woke netflix), than showing the gruesome murders of the killer. Show got boring very fast with weird subplots and by the end you were not watching Jeffs show, you were watching a drama from the downtown milwakee.

If you want to see a good serial killer show, watch the night stalker. That one really hits the spot."

7.0,23 September 2024,I didn't realize this was an Anthology Series. Thought Monters was only about Menendez Brothers story. I looked up their case right now and new evidence has come to light to possibly prove their years of Abuse. The 5th Episode really shook me. The horror that Lyles life was made into. And they need more people to see this Incredibly Moving series and hear their side. The acting is incredible in the show and Lyle wow nearly made me cry. I never cry in these kinda shows. I also never heard about what a Monster Jose Menendez was and the mother too! If their story is true of course. If it's spoken the way they show it here. I can't disbelieve that. They did show corroboration of the story with Eriks College friend and Cousin but the finale was just heartbreaking how people ignored their side completely! I hope the Truth comes out fully at last while they are still young enough to have some semblance of a free life.
10.0,1 November 2022,
10.0,26 September 2022,"The biggest question that comes up on my mind from that series, what has changed in the policy of the public service and in Milwaukee and in general in the United States since then , was anyone from the police who turned a blind eye and all the conversations that were ignored, was anyone prosecuted? Has anyone changed any policies following the incident. I'm just shocked not by the horrible deaths that I was aware I would be exposed to following the series, but by the anger I accumulated from episode to episode caused by the police's disregard and how they actually lent a hand and helped this monster continue to kill."
8.0,18 October 2022,"This was a amazingly cool, creapy and wonderful series. I havent known about Jeff Dahmer, but no I dont know why..I like him :D And this series deserves more thank 8.1 stars...so I gave 10. I recommend this to the people who are intrested in serial killers. It took me 1 week to finish, but this 1 week was maybe the best in this year in the case of films and series. I dont really like crime films but this was soo good. And thank God there is 10 fckn' episodes.... Damn..So everyone who likes serial killers or this topic should watch it. A big clap to the editors, and to Evan Peters, who made this charater loveable and handsome.."
10.0,27 September 2022,"If one makes a lengthy series about Jeffrey Dahmer, one of the most infamous and sick -he was necrophile, cannibal and relentless - person in the world, a raw and more intense approach would have sufficed. An Ari Aster or Gus Van Sant type of rawness and realness could have been much better. There were very few intimacy, always in shorts, while in reality as we know, that was not the case that they remained in clothes for a long time.

Richard Jenkins is amazing as the father as he has been ever since Six feet under.

I really do not get when there is such a compelling real life story as is, why the unnecessary changes. Kinda expected way more, got a huge potential."
6.0,22 September 2022,"Honestly, this film is difficult to watch knowing what Dahmer does to his victims. However, the sheer brilliance of skill by the film crew and acting by Evans makes it hard to look away.

We as the viewer get to witness what must be the inner dialogue; the psychological 'fight or flight' that goes on inside the minds of the victims before their escape or death by Dahmer (Evans).

It is refreshing to watch a true crime series that focuses on the victims and their families; not the perpetrator so much.

It's just incredibly sad how the police failed so many of the victims and let this evil person act out his fantasies time and time again."
10.0,21 September 2022,
6.0,3 October 2022,"I didn't know anything about this Dahmer specimen. So, I am astonished.

First, the series has amazing performances from the main cast. Evan Peters, and the neighbor are the best. Second, it is the most gritty, raw, cruel series I've watched in years. And I've watched hundreds.

Third, I really loved the cinematography, ambiance and music too. The whales sounds are terrifying.

Last, it looks like most of the events from the series, are real, accurate and close to the original story, so it makes it more scary.

So, overall if you're looking for an Emmy award performance, a quality TV series and you're not scared easily (some scenes are grotesque) this one is for you."
10.0,2 April 2023,"I admit that I've absolutely binged the show: it's extremely well done, with great acting and pacing (the use of flashbacks and the change of pov didn't bother me, I think it helped making the show more varied).

However, I was fully conscious that I was watching a heavily fictionalised version of the story. The show is styled like a documentary but it's not, I think more viewers should be aware of it! Glenda's character specifically was really inaccurate, which I feel is very dishonest since she has so much space in the show. The romantic relationship between Dahmer and on of his victims is also likely something that never happened."
6.0,29 September 2022,"The series may be short, but it is long enough to make us feel many emotions in each chapter, such as fear, repulsion, sadness, empathy towards the victims and among other sensations. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it even more shocking to watch, and perhaps some viewers may leave traumatized with certain scenes. And all thanks to a great directing job and to the actor Evan Peters, who has achieved an incredible interpretation worthy of creating terror to the viewer.

We can observe human cruelty in its maximum splendor, but the series proposes us to see it from different types of perspectives, both of the murderer and the victims. At no time does it try to justify Dahmer's criminal acts, but rather it proposes us to think about whether his psychopathic behavior was due to certain factors such as a difficult life in his childhood or simply having a neurological problem or both.

Perhaps many parents will see this and understand that the education of a child is not just giving him food and taking him to school, it is also important to give him attention, and that is what the series shows us. And if Dahmer had had better parents would he have done all that? We will never know."

10.0,24 March 2023,"Evan is hands down the best actor of my generation,so talented. This was a masterpiece,as expected from Ryan Murphy,from the music, atmosphere,acting,just perfection. Dahmer was a real monster, portrayed perfectly by Evan. What he did was absolutely evil,the scary part is that the real Dahmer seemed like a shy, introverted person that you could trust. Remember Scooby Doo? Those cartoons thought us that the real monsters are humans. Racism and homophobia is why he didn't get caught sooner ,I truly believe that. From all the movies,series about Dahmer this was the best,no doubt about that. It's defently something worth watching! Good job everyone."
9.0,4 October 2022,"Can we stop making stuff like this about real murders!?! Because people now think he's a decent person ,minus the murder, because he was in a bad situation. Like wtf?!? Just because he wasn't in a good situation or whatever does not justify anything he did, surprise surprise he was a bad person that did bad stuff and nothing changes that fact. If you want to have sympathy for anyone in this situation it should be the people who lost friends and family, because they were in a 'bad situation' not him. I also will never be able to see Even Peters the same because he agreed to do this and did it well apparently. So please for the love of everything stop making stuff like this."
10.0,28 September 2022,"A grim and evil retelling of one of the many dark stories from LGBTQ community. A sickening and disturbed man.... a deadly hunter in the LGBTQ community living a seemingly normal life... completely anonymous, even within his own LGBTQ social circle.

Not recommended for younger viewers or those easily sickened ... not only by what he did ... but the ease at which he got away with it for so long.

Evan Peters absorbs the character, as he typically does, and does a chilling performance as the LGBTQ serial killer.

He should be considered for an award for this performance. It makes up for his embarrasing casting in the recent MCU TV series."
6.0,9 December 2023,"This series has to be one of the best Drame-series I've ever seen. The highlight of the series is the performances of the actors. Every actors has lit up the series with their display. Jeffrey Dahmer is played by Evan Peters and he is outstanding. He gives that serial killer vibe.

Series makes you indulge in itself. Jeffrey Dahmer's story revolves around how he turned into a serial killer. The timeline changes between each scene due to the non-chronological presentation of the story. I like this way of representing a story. We see the event first and then it unfolds itself about how it happened.

Background score is amazing. Specially those whale sounds in the end of every episode.

If you are curious about Dahmer, the serial killer, this will fulfill your thirst. Without a doubt, a must watch series."
10.0,29 September 2024,
8.0,9 October 2024,"I had decided against watching this show because of the bad reviews. I guess I'm going to have to give more poorly-reviewed shows a shot now, because this was a gem. It's a rollercoaster of a story that leaves you guessing and second-guessing about what happened. The cast is ingenious, the acting superb, the pace is varied, and your sympathies change constantly. It is highly memorable. The deliberate ambiguity surrounding the defence offered by the brothers is brave and makes for gripping drama. Cooper Koch obviously deserves an Emmy for his tour de force monologue episode. Totally amazing season."
6.0,1 October 2022,"The show is too long and should have been halved in length. The actor Dahmer's performance is too sympathetic and not very frightening. I like the focus on his neighbour, the racism played out by the cops, and the focus on the victims at the end. This was a show about empathy on all ends with just a bit of terror. I don't really understand the controversy because they covered all of the bases here. I think most people didn't watch the show until they end. The ending, parallels to Gacy and different forms of God's wrath / mercy happening all at once was something truly fascinating and touching in terms of story."
2.0,7 October 2022,"Ever wonder what it would look like if the dumbest and most histrionic 'National Inquirer' reporter wrote and directed a film? Here you go. Another exploitative, voyeuristic, overacted flick fetishizing serial killers. Beyond this films odious moral mistakes, it's also a poor movie technically, the dialogue is poorly written and inorganic to a degree that's almost amusing. Evan Peters either seemed completely disinterested or he was trying way too hard. This series contains no nuance, it's not even effectively creepy, this is salacious, sensationalistic and just absolutely pointless. The victims family are completely right to be upset. Also the fact Netflix included this in the 'LGBTQ+' section. This is an industry that makes money off suffering, In a better world it would not exists."
10.0,18 October 2022,"One of the best series I've ever watched, finally some quality production from Netflix.

Acting is top notch, Evan Peters deserves an oscar for his performance.

Story itself is disturbing to say the least we've all heard about Dahmer and his killings but to witness it is just a whole different experience. What happened to those men is a tragedy that could have been prevented, the series did a decent job in telling some of the victims stories.

All the episodes have a dark thrilling vibes to it that continue with you even after you stop watching that's how intense it is.

Get ready to be sad and angry."
8.0,17 December 2023,"If the police could have taken action prior to 17 deaths. Many lives could be saved. Most of the times, if police could have listen to those neighours then many innocent lives could be saved.

Such a cruel and horrible person who performed such incidents. Overall very good series.

Whenever any serial killer arise, in most of the cases it is the police fault who do nit listen to either victims or people who have seen those killers. Police need to take care of such incidents.

Watching this series was a goosebump. Literally shocked to see this series that such people exist in our world. Good series."
10.0,15 October 2022,"After finishing this show, I was shocked and left with trust-issues. I was glued at the screen, probably because the storytelling is so compelling and it leaves you with fear and disgust. Even if Dahmer story is known world wide, this show includes little plot twists that keep you entratained.

The acting is also a strong element in this show: the cast was perfect. Other than Evan Peters that was spectacular in such a difficult role, I really liked the character of Glenda. I don't think that Dahmer is the main character of this show, because it seems like many different people around him have a role as big as his.

It was a really brilliant show, but I hope that it doesn't bring back the trend of ""loving serial killers"" or imitating them, because there's nothing to romanticise about such disgusting and disturbing acts."
8.0,21 September 2024,"JOSE and Kitty Menendez got what they deserved.

I wish their sons had shot to them dead when they were little Kids so they would have been free of this house.

Jose and Kitty are the MONSTERS in this story.

Kitty had no excuse. A mother has 1 job: keep your kids safe. You can't be perfect. But you can't let them get raped IN YOUR HOME FOR YEARS and not do anything.

Javier is incredible in this : to play someone so horrible in such a compelling way.

There is also a very compelling story about their attorney and her own journey and her own maternal instincts that kick in.

I have always believed that this was a manslaughter case, since i watched it live as a teenager."
7.0,26 September 2022,"This started out ok. Obviously, the Jeffrey Dahmer story on its own is highly compelling. It should have been easy to make a great miniseries about the story.

Unfortunately, after a few episodes of decent story (but subpar acting), the series goes downhill rapidly. Instead of a story about Jeffrey Dahmer, it becomes a typical Netflix production that focuses on politics and race.

You'll be lectured about AIDS and told in one episode that it impacts churchgoers more than the gay community. Then, the story will shift into a focus on race. You know the drill with Netflix by now: White people bad and Black people good.

If that's not enough for you, wait until you have to watch an entire episode with no sound because the director thinks it's important for you to experience the episode as if you were deaf.

This show becomes unwatchable. Don't waste your time."
10.0,4 October 2024,"This story has been done to death. It's not interesting anymore even with Hollywood licence to make most of it up. The brothers are annoying but otherwise uninteresting and these actors are a snooze fest. Definitely think they drew it out far too long. I made it halfway through then it was pushing jelly uphill.

I felt the same about the Dahmer season. Except that the actor playing Dahmer was too good at playing him. Guess I just don't understand why they insist in doing more documentaries, remakes, reimagining etc of these old tired cases. Yes they were horrible crimes and still are but let them rest. Unfortunately there are a plethora of cases from this century that could be much less tired."
10.0,22 February 2023,"Never had happened I feel pity for both the evil and the victims. Think it's a good thing the series has multiple directors, so there will be different aspect of the case to be explored. The actors do a perfect job. Apart from Peters, Nash and Jenkins are brilliant, too.

Depicting the kills just by the voices it makes and through the reactions the neighbor shows is a real good trick and makes the murders much more horrifying.

I say again, I really felt for Duhmer and it goes back to the Peter's acting a lot. He is very talented. Think we hear much more from him in the future.

Thanks to the creators. This series is a perfect example of perfection."
6.0,15 October 2022,"Amazing acting and compelling/disturbing story, but I can't help but feel I am no better than the people back in the day that sensationalized Jeffery Dahmer by supporting and watching this all in the name of entertainment.

I'm sure this show will win awards and there will be thunderous applause, but it feels wrong. I can't imagine the families of the victims having to relive their nightmare while Netflix and all involved become wealthy and famous.

The series did a perfect job at showing us just what kind of monster this man was and insight into his life, but as long as we continue to create and consume this type of content, his victims and their families will continue to be hurt over and over."
3.0,3 October 2022,"I knew about the story of Jeffrey Dahmer and was therefore very afraid about watching this show. I thought it would be too disturbing and it took me a couple of days to decide to give it a try, convinced I wouldn't get past the first episode.

Well, I have to say I got through the whole series and enjoyed it quite a bit. Well done, never boring, a great show. I even found myself eating ice cream while watching it.

Because I knew the story and was able to eat ice cream while watching it I substracted a couple of points to the voting I would have given it had it been a work of fiction.

I find the producers used the power of attraction that such an infamous serial killer has, to sell a show that wasn't really his story, let alone the story of his victims. If this show was to honor what really happened, very few people would have been able to sit through the whole thing. In this 10 hour long episodes series there was less information about why Jeffery Dahmer became so notorious than in a two page article of any magazine. It really is difficult to even imagine a more nightmarish way to die than what these men went through, but in the show it's only hinted if not hidden. I found especially disrespectful a scene where the victim's families discuss suing some media for using a distorted vision of Jeffery Dahmer to sell magazines when the show featuring this event was doing exactly the same. I can only imagine what a slap in the face it must be for these people to watch this scene, almost ridiculing them.

Also I will say that in the show I even liked Jeffrey, he seemed kind of funny and darling. Almost just a tad naughty.

On the other hand, I did think they did a good job portraying the attitude of law enforcement and the role that prejudice must have played in this tragedy. As well I found compelling the depiction of the journey of Jeffery Dahmer's neighbor. How terrifying it must have been for her. It shows an angle from these stories we don't often think about.

So it's a great TV show very enjoyable, but I feel they cheated trying to sell it using Jeffery Dahmer's name."
10.0,26 September 2022,"This show started off well. But the more episodes I watched, the more the pace of the series started to annoy me. Another thing that bothered me was the constant time jumps. It didn't make any sense. And then they mixed in some political stuff about race, even though Dahmer also killed white and a latino men. And of course it's all the (white) police fault, according to Netflix. It's true that the police made some horrible mistakes, but of course Netflix had to portray some pure evil white cops.

And the last two episodes get totally ridiculous. They make a charicature of the christian faith. No pastor would ever say 'congratulations, your sins are forgiven' after you're baptized. 'cause that's not what baptism does. Yes, it symbolizes it. But if you don't believe that Jesus died for you, then there's no forgiveness of sins. So, this show is kind of ridiculing the christian faith by telling that Dahmer just gets his peace with God for going down in a bath.

And then there's the killer of Dahmer.. man.. I won't spoil anything, but they totally make that political as well. Sorry about my english. It's not my native language.

Anyway, a 2 for the acting."
9.0,7 October 2022,Evan peters is truly Dahmer. His acting is so well fit to the role of exploring his own self to become Dahmer you feel it everytime you watch him. The supporting cast does a fantastic job enhancing the experience as well here and overall it is a great time exploring the life of a prolific serial killer. While hard to watch with how dark it can be at times you do also feel for him and it's something you keep wanting to return to after every episode for just one more binge.. but then the cycle continues again. Overall this was a great educational experience and Evan Peters was cast so well in this role. Great to see the facts gathered together too which made the show and I'm very glad this show was made.
10.0,18 October 2022,
10.0,15 October 2024,"I can't say I loved season one of Monsters considering it was one of the most disturbing series I had ever watched, but it was very well acted and executed. Season two of Monsters for me at least was much more gripping from the begining to the end and the acting felt more grounded and realistic.

Every single actor involved brought their A-Game but I have to say episode 5 titled The Hurt Man is hands down one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a very long time. Cooper Koch is a phenomonally talented actor that deserves all the awards I am sure he is going to win. From the perfectly done score/soundtrack to the costume design and set pieces, nothing about this show feels cheap.

At the end of the day this second season did exactly what I expected it to do. It made me feel sick, anxious and on edge. It's definitely not the type of series I would recommend to anyone, but if you enjoyed the first season you should definitely give this one a shot."
7.0,7 October 2024,"Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story is a gripping and compelling true-crime series that delivers a thoughtful look at the Menendez brothers case. The show dives deep into the psychological and emotional aspects of Lyle and Erik's lives, shedding light on their traumatic upbringing and the complex family dynamics that led to their tragic actions.

The writing and pacing are tight, balancing courtroom drama with flashbacks to the brothers' tumultuous past, creating a layered and emotionally charged viewing experience. The cinematography and direction are also top-notch, enhancing the tension and emotional stakes throughout the series.

Overall, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story is a well-produced, thought-provoking series that challenges the audience to reconsider a case that has long been part of the true-crime canon. It's a must-watch for fans of the genre who are looking for a deeper, more empathetic portrayal of this infamous crime."
10.0,24 October 2022,"Seeing as though one of the casts most crucial rules was to make sure not to tell the story from Dahmer's perspective, I think they did well.

Typically with movies/shows that follow the protagonist (or antagonist in this case), we tend to attach to the main character and try to relate or sympathize but I was completely unable to in this series. This is the first time I've ever been able to not relate, sympathize, or give a hoot or a hollar about the character that's being followed in the story.

I have a lot of respect for Even Peters and all of the other folks who played as the victims and the victims families. It's difficult telling a huge and popular story, especially one so grim and controversial and not having millions of people raising a metaphorical pitchfork at you."
6.0,19 March 2023,"Gave me nightmares for two straight nights while I watched the series. But I gotta say Peters is outstanding as Dahmer. Excellent and painfully realistic portrayal of a serial killer. The actor who did Lionel's role needs a special mention. He simply was a wormhole which I used to dive back into time and understand a father's conflicting emotions in such a situation. I would have been disappointed had this been a documentary because there are enough serial killer documentaries out there.

The fictionalised real story of an infamous serial killer is what drew my attention to this.

Caution: Those who are averse to violence, please stay away from this. But if you wanna know how the mind of a serial killer works, you came to the right place."
8.0,18 October 2022,"LOVED. Can't wait for peters to do more stuff even. The dad tho in this OMG. LIONEL. ( Richard Jenkins) he blew me away. BOTH deserve Oscar's. Anything !!!! Unbelievably amazing. Please give it a shot. I've seen scary things. This didn't scare me. It educated me. It helped me understand what I never knew , and to be a part of our history. Love it. Next one should be Gacy w/ same director producer. But that one might make me too scared haha. With all said and done THANKYOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE. I believe it woke many teens and to never trust anyone you don't know as well. Things happen for reasons."
7.0,3 October 2022,"I loved Evan Peters' phenomenal portrayal of Geoff Dahmer. So menacing and sad in many ways.

The sets and feel of the show was beat perfect, from the aesthetics to the lighting and cinematography which was suitably bleak as a portrayal of Dahmer's life and environment, both growing up and as an adult.

However - and this is a BIG however - the series could have easily been condensed into 5-6 episodes and I really felt it dragged. I lost interest and considering he's a very compelling person this was disappointing. Sorry, but these stories need to be approached with a better Editors eye on them to be successful in the Netflix format."
1.0,8 October 2022,"I have several beefs with this show.

First, this could have been done in 6 episodes. Instead a scene that could last 10 seconds is protracted to 50. Many scenes and themes are repeated 4-6 times and I kept screaming 'Again?!'

Second is the annoying practice that filmmakers overdo these days: jumping in time a hundred times, backward and forward, forward and backward. It was nauseating overkill in this show.

Third, many scenes are just unnecessary. They do not add any value or clarity. Taken out, they wouldn't leave gaps in the story.

Starting in e4 thru to the end, I kept fast forwarding to move the story along. All in all I give this show a thumbs down."
10.0,6 November 2023,"Even Peters is extremely talented in any role he plays, I know he has a past of playing dark characters but I think his portrayal of Dahmer was eye opening for some. The entire horrible incident that was this mans life must've been very difficult for Peters to play as but there were things I learned about the case that i didnt know beforehand. I do wish the movie wouldve stayed stricter to the facts because it really is an eye opening movie and absolutely crazy that something like this could not only happen during this time period but the blatant disregard for humanity people had even back then. I say give it a watch if you like true crime stuff at all, but I still wouldnt watch it more than once."
10.0,18 October 2022,"In this mini-series, you follow the events of the life of Jeffrey Dahmer, probably one of the most famous serial killer in America's history. This is a slow (a bit too slow some times) and horrific tale of a twisted mind. The main actor perfectly plays the role, you totally believe he could be Jeffrey Dahmer.

The events are not shown chronologically, which could be confusing for certain people, but I thought it was a great creative decision considering some of Jeffrey's killings are not as interesting as other's (still absolutely horrible and victims shouldn't be overlooked), they did a great job at making the whole show interesting. The episode 2 and 6 hits you particularly hard.

Ultimately, this show is great, but it also helped Dahmer in one of is fantasy, being loved, being remembered, being seen, and for that, I cannot feel good about watching this series."
9.0,24 February 2023,"I realise at the end that it's focussing equally on the victims.

A lot of these shows come to be about the serial killer and even I've wondered about the injustice in that, since the people who died and their families are the ones who are worst affected.

This one tries to take the focus away from that. You sympathise with the families, you get to know some of the victims and even feel awful at their deaths (one of them the most).

All in all the show was very very slow and boring. But it's fine. I don't think this is one of those series that can be swept aside saying it's boring or even worse, revered because it's entertaining.

This one had a more complex overview of the entire situation, instead of a monotonous investigation+chase feel that The Night Stalker has.

I remember feeling effed up after The Night Stalker because... *Shrugs * He wasn't human.

But you connect with Jeff on a human level and understand his psyche here. It's... It's definitely something."
9.0,27 November 2023,"First of all, I really like the color and artistic conception of the picture. The choices of characters and supporting actors are excellent, and the acting is really good. This is one of the reasons why I particularly like this series. Secondly, I read a lot of reviews about the fictionalization of the plot. I think this is a series that has a lot of adaptations, probably because the director wanted to simplify it... and focus on the issues of race and police. I have to say that if you want to know more about Dahmer's true situation, there are clearer documentaries. But if you want to emphasize the importance of racial, criminal, and political emphasis on the disadvantaged, I like this movie."

7.0,17 October 2022,"Barring its fair share of inefficiencies, it is indeed a fascinating take on a wicked mind, a deeply affecting character study on a heinous perpetrator who had perpetrated some of the most unimaginable crimes and did unspeakable wrongs to not one but a dozen of innocent people. 'Dahmer' provides an intriguing perspective into a killer's crooked mentality, it sheds some light on his corrupted senses of what might be wrong and what might be right!

Albeit the same parameters of judgment often got flooded with contradictory notions and a lack of respect and sympathy towards all the victims and their families. I noticed many had already spoken against the glorifying aspects of this particular portrayal and how it tries to instill empathy for the wrongdoer and I hereby raise my voice as well.

You shouldn't at any expense glorify a vicious criminal like Jeffrey L. Dahmer. Yes, you can create Documentaries all you want; matter of fact, you should show us what exactly made him an aberration, inform other parents about the red flags, about the 'signs' they should be looking for in their children and their recurrent misdemeanors. But don't try to romanticize this stuff, trust me when I say this, there will be consequences beyond your control.

P. S. Evan Peters, I hope you are not missing any of your therapy sessions, you need it, brother! A terrific enactment by the way, kudos!"
10.0,14 January 2023,"There are so many parallels between the way Dahmer is portrayed in this series and Napoleon Dynamite. Yes this series is about a notorious serial killer and yet I couldn't help but my find self laughing at times because I felt the show was less serious and more ""Dark Comedy"". One can't help but to draw parallels to both Napoleon Dynamite's character and Stepbrothers - thanks to his father portrayed by Richard Jenkins. The interactions between Dahmer and his grandmother were comical at times, as were his interactions with other people. Yes, it's a story about one of the most well know serial killers of all time, but this wasn't the type of series that had you walking away with concern for Dahmer's victims as it was more about his persona and quirky mannerisms."
7.0,30 March 2023,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is a limited series that chronicles the life of infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. The series provides an in-depth look into the mind of a murderer, as it explores the events that led to Dahmer's heinous crimes and the aftermath of his arrest.

To me, the series effectively captures the disturbing nature of Dahmer's crimes while providing a nuanced exploration of his psychology and the impact of his actions on his victims and their families. I really enjoyed the tension, atmosphere, and the acting of the series. Evan Peters delivers a chilling performance, worthy of the Emmy he won."
5.0,21 September 2024,"Dahmer was made in a way that highlights qualities in him that are redeemable trying to make the audience sympathise the menendez brothers story is disgustingly inaccurate and sympathises with the abusers and makes the victims look bad, no wonder why victims don't come out about their abuse you'd think after the victims families came out about the trauma of reliving the dahmer series that they wouldn't make ANOTHER series and twist the truth when it comes to men who were abused and ridiculed by media, and are also still locked up actually gross

Director and netflix is disgusting for this show."
8.0,27 December 2023,I had my reservations about whether or not to watch this and I went back-and-forth for several months before deciding finally to watch it. Is it well made? Yes. Is it addictive? Yes. Did I watch it having to pause it several times due to the intensity of the material? Of course. The series is bingable and watchable. Is it appropriate to watch knowing these are real victims? I don't know. I did feel sad watching it but I am glad I watched the whole thing because I learned a lot. I learned that he could have been caught years earlier if only the racist and homophobic police would have done their job properly. It's infuriating but I hope that society as a whole can learn something from these tragedies so that another Jeffrey Dahmer can never exist again.
9.0,20 October 2022,"I gave a 10 out of a 10 because they did a good job production wise, telling the story but it is horrible. What I get out of it is that, there is still a lot of racism in the USA even after all these years. Even though his motive wasn´t discrimination, I mean by the police and the justice system. We can still see it today and it is not okay. If anything I hope this helps send this message and fix it but I doubt it will happen. As we have seen similar cases still in the 2000s, many years later. Also it is horrible to relive all these events, I hope they dont make anymore of these real stories and just do fiction for the sake of the victims´ families."
8.0,19 October 2022,"A fabulous tragedy. This series turns the inside's out, literally... You might feel disgust, disbelief, and perhaps sick. Angry, sad, or sorry for Jeffrey. - Whatever you feel is not wrong.

I recommend taking some time off and watching something else when it gets tough. I myself usually binge shows, but with this - for me it wasn't possible.

That being said, it is a beautiful telling of a real and gruesome serial killer - his unspeakable actions and its repercussions. The Dahmer family, the victims families, the police, every angle is tackled masterfully.

Excellent camera work, especially the absurd close-close ups that makes you feel trapped in the room with Jeff. It really gets under your skin...

Lastly, perfect casting! The writing is d*mn good, so ofcourse that helps (Worth noting: some of it is actual words spoken during the real events). But, Evan Peters as Jeffrey Dahmer gets the mannerisms and body movement just right. And it is astonishing with the way he manages to get the tone of Jeff's voice heard on interviews spot on. He's balancing on a razor blade and he's locked in! His performance have been covered widely, but i couldn't help mentioning it.

Lastly x2: With the title of this review i wanted to give credit to Richard Jenkins! His scenes towards the end really got to me. Both me and my viewing companion couldn't stop tears shedding for Lionel Dahmer and the mountain of weights put on his shoulders after the reveal."
8.0,20 October 2022,"I'm not normally a fan of shows/film that rely on jumping around a timeline, but it works well for this mini-series. Evan Peters is fantastic, and I cannot wait to see how doors this role opens for him.

The show did a great job of making me uncomfortable, yet portraying numerous different lives all intersecting with one another. I appreciated the victims points of view, and now have so much more knowledge of their tragic situations. I understand where other reviewers are coming from in that I do believe it humanizes Dahmer, but I don't personally have an issue with that.

I think the show runners did a great job of retelling stories from unique perspectives, because let's be honest, Dahmer has been over produced."
6.0,27 September 2022,
9.0,24 September 2022,"Evan Peter's really made this, the way he portrays Dahmar was just spot on, better than Efrons bundy imo, but other than that and the anticipation of what he will do next and how it does shine more light on the victims which often gets overlooked with our facination with serial killers but the rest was lacking. Extremly repetitive, long and drawn out storytelling and once again over saturation of woke idealism. Can be a great thing when called for but coming from the likes of Ryan Murphy I just expected a great horror mocumentary about Dahmer and his victims. What could've been became more politicized to serve a specific agenda it seemed, its not a requirement for everything entertainment anymore but yet again were flooded and forced on us. What starts as a great horror drama just fell short by over political controversial takes and the over misuse of the length of the 10 hour long episodes. Casting and characters over all where perfect to which half way saves the series."
6.0,21 September 2023,"As a parent you think you only have to worry about your kids until they are young and they would be safe when they become adults. You then watch Dahlmer and you realize there are real monsters in the world and it's never too safe or too old to not take a drink from a stranger.

Dahlmer series is very well directed and played by actors to the point that its disturbing. The racial injustice demonstrated by both the police and judiciary system also makes you feel angry at times about the system and people involved.

Series is very well made so atleast you cannot complain that it was not done properly. However looking at the content, I would say, you have been warned.

Watch at your own risk. It's disturbing!"
8.0,22 September 2022,"Peters is amazing not just in his acting but his embodiment of the character. Nash and Learned are also brilliant. Performances are deserving of the rating. The drawback is the sensationalized depiction, not just the focus on the grotesque murders but with dark lighting, butcher shop meat etc that seems more like a horror movie when it's a horrific true story. At ten episodes it's too long to tell this story unless it had more focus on the victims and their story, especially the Laotian family who had two brothers victimized by Dahmer. More development of victims story could have made this more interesting and less disturbing, but more importantly made this about telling the victims story. Sensationalize story telling wasn't necessary and missed an opportunity for original storytelling from the victims perspective and the impact Dahmer had exponentially on so many lives beyond just those he murdered, like Glenda Cleveland. Even the focus of those victimized is on Dahmer's family, white people. Yes they are victims too, but the balance is off."
7.0,13 October 2022,"Excellent series that provokes contradictory emotions. We can therefore salute the visual quality, writing and the series seems to reconstruct the Dahmer affair and what happened around it very well. But we are also surprised to feel guilty for appreciating all these qualities knowing that all this really existed. I think that makes this work worse than a horror movie both visually and morally! The series focuses. Making sure that the life of a criminal is told in a real series rather than in a simple documentary really gives a more realistic effect, we feel stronger emotions on the acts that Jeff commits, a bit too long at times, but that contributes to the pervasive tension of the series, to really watch!"
1.0,24 September 2022,"It was a good series.. it was also very slow. I watched some of the real dahmer interviews and he wasn't that slow.. speech nor mentally. I also thought they left out a lot of gory details, especially considering this was done by Murphy who has held a lot less back for his AHS episodes. Some of those AHS episodes I was thinking how in the world is this on tv. This series shows not much really other than ""sounds and smells"" thru a vent. I don't know, guess I just expected real horror and gore and it was a bunch of talking. I do like that it showed kind of how he became the way he was. That must've been their goal and the only goal."
10.0,19 October 2022,
9.0,21 January 2024,"I can understand why this series has caused so much controversy given the central character is one of the most vile and evil people to ever exist on this planet. If you were a family member of the victims you would find it very difficult to watch or even think about the existence of such a show that gives him any notoriety, In that sense I personally found it best to watch it as if it were a work of fiction. In which case it was very well done and compelling with an emphasis on trying to understand the psychology behind the killings. I did have to pause it a couple of times and watch something mindless in between but generally it held my attention."
10.0,13 October 2024,"'Monsters' is a gripping series that tells its story in an impressive way. The balance in the storyline is perfect; you might initially think that the brothers are the real monsters, but the series challenges you to consider the role of the parents. This gives viewers a unique space to reflect on the complex dynamics within the family.

The young actors portraying the brothers are truly fantastic. I wasn't familiar with them before, but I'm convinced we'll be hearing a lot more from them in the future. In particular, one of the boys delivers an incredibly compelling performance during an entire episode filmed in one take, showcasing his remarkable acting skills.

Additionally, the cinematography is stunning, and the music adds an extra layer to the emotional impact of the series. 'Monsters' is not just a story about monsters; it's a piece of art that makes you think. Absolutely a must-watch!"
9.0,4 October 2022,Well to start this review I have to say the series overall is very good. You get the chilling experience of what it may have been like for the victims. It's unbelievable to think what these poor people went through as well as their families. I did not care much the episodes 7 & 8 but managed through them to reached the finally. It is sad to see how Dahmer grew up and what it created in him. And because of that so many suffered. I'm sure many things were dramatized to add to the series. Mental health is a serious business and needs further study. Can't wait to watch the Dahmer tapes when it comes out.
6.0,1 October 2023,"Extremely well-acted, written, and directed series. Presenting Dahmer's case in a thoroughly cohesive and provocative way. Jumping around the chronology of the events sheds light on many other controversies. Such as how he could get away with this for so long and his whole ambiguous reasoning for continuing on despite being acutely aware of what monster he had become.

It is so curious to see through the internet the assertive cries of people who cannot understand why this series was made. The morbid fascination with serial killers and true crime in general isn't anything new. Be it pure fiction or based on true events, particularly here, it's the bellows of people who think Dahmer is being glorified and the victims' families are being lacerated by the sheer existence of this series, and we need to wait for the Ed Gein era for Dahmer where no one who was alive would give a damn and his entire profile becomes public domain folklore.

The fact that a new piece of Dahmer media comes out every few years doesn't bother anyone. No, it's the fact that it's Netflix's biggest hit since Stranger Things; that's the issue people are at odds with. If it just flew under the floorboards, the thought of the victims cries would be much more subdued. This is Tiger King all over again."
9.0,31 December 2022,"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is a Netflix mini-series created by Ryan Murphy. Evan Peters definitely deserves awards for his role as Dahmer. The storyline follows the true life events of Dahmer from his days as a young boy when his father played by Richard Jenkins would take him fishing and dissect road killed animals. His mother Shari was played by Molly Ringwald used to take painkillers and other drugs during her pregnancy with Dahmer. The public viewed him as a monster but from his point of view he was just as normal as anyone else. I blame the parents for his upbringing, maybe if he had a proper parental units he would not have the urgency to the awful things. Niecy Nash and her real life played daughter played Dahmer's neighbor Glenda Cleveland although the true story is Glenda lived two buildings away. The mini-series was very captivating and not as gruesome as you would think but overall I would highly recommend checking it out."
7.0,31 May 2023,"Dahmer is a new crime series that explores the life of the infamous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.

The show is well-watched, but it lacks some aspects.

The acting is pretty much good, with Evan Peters delivering a terrifying performance in the lead role.

The series also showcases the psychological and emotional struggle that Dahmer went through, which is the interesting aspect of the series.

However, the pace of the show can be slow at times, and some scenes feel repetitive.

Additionally the series does not delve deep enough into the stories of the victims, which is a big missed opportunity

Overall, Dahmer is a good crime series worth watching if you are interested in true crime stories. However, it is not an innovative series and does not offer anything new to the genre."
8.0,2 October 2022,"The Dahmer Series on Netflix is a must watch... if you have the stomach for it. Evan Peters is PHENOMENAL in his part as Jeffery, he's brilliant, and terrifying to watch. The show does a very good job making the show feel REAL, and will leave audiences with churned stomachs. The overall directing, acting, and accuracy to the true events is VERY impressive, and it really goes into depth of how Jeff became Jeff. However, the show is VERY dark, and will easily upset any average viewer. However, you know the show was done well if it can successfully disturb you. If you can stomach some gore and tough subjects, then this show is a must watch! Overall a great show."
6.0,9 October 2022,"""Dahmer"" is an interesting character study about loneliness, compulsion, and control. The actor who plays Dahmer capture's the character's sense of humiliation and dominance in his quiet, heavy breathing and dead eye stares.

I quite liked the relationship portrayed between Dahmer and his father, which is troubled and sincere, depicting a father who did his best but also may have damaged his son, though unintentionally and without malice.

When the focus shifted off Dahmer and his immediate family, I believe the show began to unravel as the other characters just do not come across as nuanced or as strong. Respect to the victim's families, but I believe there should instead be a different show that can make a fuller effort at getting to know who was impacted.

I did decide to skip through most of the series. I do think ""Dahmer"" is two kinds of tv shows in one, which did not quite work for me, and made the series seem overlong.

I do take issue with the 'vengeful god' death at the end. When you do a series about a serial killer, you kind of have to put aside trying to force a moral perspective. And it felt like the end tried to force that moral lens. So as a viewer to me that felt like an imposition, and like signposting.

Anyway the parts that is a psychological study, I appreciate. The parts that are signposting, I tuned out. That's probably unfortunate as there is legitimate issues brought to light. However, repeating a message in the same way tends to do that. I did appreciate the message the first time though."
4.0,9 October 2022,"Dahmer was not perfect by any means. It was disturbing, but a show about Jeffrey Dahmer should be. I enjoyed the first 5 episodes more than the last 5, but the series is worth watching. The biggest thing I took away from this show was the performance of Evan Peters as Jeff Dahmer. He was amazing. Peters' portrayal was what kept me watching. I would like to see him get more major movie roles, perhaps in a different genre. Richard Jenkins was fantastic as Jeffrey Dahmers father as well, but he's great in almost all of his roles. I rarely write reviews on shows/movies, but Peters was so good I had to write one. This show is not for everyone, but it is worth watching for Peters' performance alone."
8.0,8 November 2022,Would have been great if it centered on Dahmer. Instead we get a large focus on Niecy Nash playing Glenda Cleveland whom I could care less about. Evan Peters shows his acting chops in this role. Every time he is on screen you cant help but focus solely on him. He was the best part of AHS and hopefully this will be his breakout role. I understand that Netflix wants to make this more about race and police relations in this post George Floyd world but this seemed to focus on the man and what caused and drove him to his fixations on murder. Tearing you away from that to some minor police room drama and the insufferable neighbor hinders that and takes away from the brutality of the story.
10.0,10 October 2022,"As someone who partakes in viewing true crime content, this is very disrespectful. There was no warning or care for the people portrayed, the people who lost their loved ones. This is a purely for profit, no care given approach. Netflix has gotten really bad about their true crime content and how little care they put into it, glorifying horrible people, no compassion for survivors.

If you enjoy true crime content but want to watch it ethically, Netflix is not a good streaming service to watch it on. They need to be mindful of the people involved and stop glorifying serial killers. Because all this stuff recently is just sick."
8.0,30 September 2022,"Compelling doesn't even begin to describe this show-I was glued to the screen for all 10 episodes. Evan Peters deserves an Emmy for his jaw-dropping performance as Dahmer that at once humanizes him and portrays his brutality. He makes the incomprehensibly crazy and awful things that Dahmer has done seem understandable within the context of his environment. The atmospheric music (using whale songs as the key aural motif was creative and brilliant), pace, and performances all around are top notch. Won't soon forget this one. Bravo to all involved. It's dark, but if you think you can handle it, run, don't walk, to watch this tour de force."
10.0,24 February 2024,
7.0,27 October 2023,"Hands down the best thing I have ever watched on Netflix. To answer a few reviewers point's.

It does state (as in most reconstructed dramas) some bits are made up..however they are based on facts.

Glenda wasn't living in the same building but the events that prompted her calling the police are factual.

The police involved DID get service awards..promotions..etc..maybe not at that specific time;but year's down the line they factually did. The acting in this is superb and Jeff (the actor) should win every award going he's that good. I was sad when this finished.

If you read up all these event's did happen."
10.0,19 October 2022,"I give it a 10, mostly because of Evan Peters, but the show as a whole is outstanding! I have seen Evan act before in X-Men, Kickass, AHS and some more productions, but this one is a performence of a lifetime if you ask me. I have also studied Dahmer before, as I am fascinated by forensic psychology. You can feel the amount of hard work that was put into perfecting the performance and you can feel it in every scene, every line and in every breath that Peters takes. No other show had ever had that much of an impact on me while watching it. It took me about 3 hours to recover from episode 4. The nausea, fear and depression that it had brought onto me was mind-blowing and a bit overwhelming. I had believed that I was immune to such content, having seen and read so many things about serial killers already, but this show has to be an exception.

I don't think that it is something you can watch purely for entertainment. It tells a true story and the people who have lived it are still alive. It is serious food for thought as it proceeds to show many problems that still can be seen in society. It explains what could have contributed to Dahmer becoming a killer, but in a way that doesn't let him off the hook. Even despite his early years triggering some sympathy, at least in me. However, it does portray his victims as more than just his victims. They are shown as people who are to this day loved dearly and missed and who did not deserved to be killed.

Loved it, especially the 6th episode. The acting is on point, kudos to the guy playing Tony. The Jefferey Dahmer story is honestly a masterpiece, but only for people who are mature enough to draw the appropriate conclusions. (Don't get me started on the people who can't shut up about how attractive Dahmer was...)"
7.0,16 October 2024,"S02 started very well, the actor that plays the father is outstanding, he's an amazing Spanish actor famous for the movie biutiful (forgot his name lol).

The 1st half of the season 2 is quite good. Then the 2nd part comes and it just feels like a whole new show, a comedy with some kind of housewives drama. The main motive for this drop of quality is the way they wrote the female lawyer, Leslie. Also quite a horrible performance, can't stand her acting and character, just super annoying.

It's almost like different teams wrote different episodes. Crazy how episodes 1-5 were really good and the rest of the episodes are unwatchable."
10.0,28 December 2023,"This was my first Jeffrey Dahmer movie/series that I saw and i have to say. This series definitely feels real.

Evan Peter's EXTRAORDINARY acting skills in this disturbing crime/docudrama series is just done SO WELL!

This series definitely manages to capture the moment of the Jeffrey Dahmer cases and especially what Jeffrey Dahmer used to do.

The acting is great, the story is great, the characters are great, the crime/docudrama/thriller (or whatever you wanna say) is great, the runtime on each episode is great. There's just SO many things in this show that manage to make this feel so real! It's a VERY disturbing which is also VERY well made.

I don't know THAT MUCH about the history of Jeffrey Dahmer but what I DO know is that he is a cannibal, serial killer and s3x offender, and this show managed to recreate the story of Jeffrey Dahmer in a VERY well way. Evan Peters has VERY good acting in this series and this serious WANTS to take itself serious and it DOES. It definitely does."
6.0,4 October 2022,
10.0,3 October 2022,"Dahmer is scary, sick and whole level of disturbing. Evan Peters delivered absolutely everything. You can feel all his emotions, he made everything transparent. You'll even hate the poor actor by the end. You won't feel any remorse for him, not even a single Ounce. No sympathy or empathy for him even though he serious mental issues. Binge worthy if you are a true crime junkie. Glenda also played an amazing role. You'll feel you're living in her apartment. Get ready for some serious nightmares. Netflix delivered an amazing crime/documentary series. Amazing edit, amazing background score. Hats off to every crew member."
8.0,8 October 2022,This show was one of the most disturbing things I've ever watched. It felt so shocking of learning how many times they could've caught Dahmer but they ultimately didn't until it was too late. This show was extremely difficult to watch especially episode 3. That episode was one of the hardest things I've ever watched. It was super dark and made me feel so disturbed while watching this show. Evan Peter's does deserve an Oscar for his performance though due to the fact it was so dark to watch and he made it super dark to watch. Overall this show is good and I'd recommend it but just be warned it does get very dark.
8.0,28 September 2022,"Although its based on the real event and real serial killer, i just found it to be a little too much in terms of the horrofic scenes. Some acceptable some arent, for me. Heavily focused on racism, cannibalism, pychopath bahaviour and white privilleges. It was really disgusting to know that how POC people were mistreated by the american society back then (even today) and how white people always be able to get away from any crimes literally. Eerie sound scores match perfectly with the storyline and characterisation of the casts, setting up a very serious mood for the audiences. This is definitely not for everyone. Not for me."
10.0,25 October 2022,"Firstly this is a very interesting story about which I knew very little. The cast are as all very good but as a drama it just doesn't deliver and from the 2nd episode I was tempted to just ditch as just didn't enjoy it!

The screenplay is just not very good and every episode is a chore rather than a joy and dragging it out for 10 episodes is just painful!

In addition it is painstakingly uncomfortable and I find myself having to pause and take a deep breath.

Really surprised about the high reviews.

My advice is don't bother and watch the Serpent instead as it's a comparable story which is just so much more entertaining!"

Evan peters is just brilliant someone plzz give him a oscar for his performance .. Rest cast is also phenomenal that guy who portrayed the father of jeffery also fantastic.. Music is just insane that song ""please dont go"" is looked that it was only made for this series.. I am out of my word if you do not watch this yet please go and watch scene by scene did not skip anything. . I watch this series in two days and I just love that actor now evan peters is one of my favourites..."
7.0,16 October 2022,"I have very mixed feelings about this series. The story is horrible and what Jeffrey Dahmer did is haunting me a little bit, but the series is very well put together. The acting is really good and the order of how the story is told is also really good. Also I found that the amount of stuff that was really shown wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Yet I got very nauseous throughout the series, because of story itself. If you want to finish the series you'll just have to get over that. I didn't really get nightmares from this series, but I do listen differently to the sounds that come from my neighbors."
10.0,30 September 2022,"Peters is convincing not just as Dahmer but as a killer, a monster. You get the impression that he's not acting. I would not be surprised if this role takes a noticeable toll on him. He's that good. Overall, this series was expertly cast. Nash, Jenkins, all of the victims, their families, even Shari are so convincing, all of them. Was this a show at all? Seems more like a reality tv show to me. I can't say enough. My mind is completely blown. Bravo! I understand the controversy surrounding this series. I think it's because it's so real that the pain is palpable. But, for the mastery and skill displayed by all involved, this series deserves to be given a chance."
6.0,2 October 2022,"I just can't get over how much Peters sounds like Pera in this. Sorry.

The show is okay. I can see why some people are saying that it's exploitative, but unfortunately a lot of things that show business does is exactly that.

Other things that bothered me - the father and mother were way too animated. Also, they could give Evan Peters weird yellow contacts, but remiss on one of the particular well-known traits of Jeffrey Dahmer? That trait being him having blue eyes - and blonde hair too, but the latter was mentioned on the show - which actually raises my suspicion all the more. Idk, it bothered me - it feels like some kind of clandestine protection for blue eyes - especially with all the details that they try to cover; on top of Evan Peters being known for his deep brown eyes; I can only hope I'm being too sensitive."
1.0,24 September 2022,"So better than a '7', but not quite an '8'.....

I've read a couple of books about JD, and seen all the interviews on YouTube, and I can assure you that factually this drama has it mostly spot on. Obviously due to the subject nature, it's dark and horrific, but if you can deal with that (or like myself - enjoy it!) - you are in for one helluva ride. It's slow, for sure, but I'm totally OK with that.

And the Emmy Award goes to.... Evan Peters for his portrayal of the man himself. Stunning piece of acting. He really does create the character of Dahmer - to the point that I actually almost felt sorry for the guy. He really does make him human, as opposed to just a cardboard cutout of a monster. And that is not easy to do. Also Niecy Nash must get a mention playing JDs long suffering neighbour. And of course, Richard Jenkins never disappoints - I remember first seeing him back in the 80s in The Witches of Eastwick with Jack Nicholson, and he was great in that.

So definitely not everyone's cup of tea - certainly not something that I would recommend to my mother, but if you like your drama dark, and have any interest at all in Jeffrey Dahmer, then trust me, you'll love this."
9.0,13 December 2022,"This show is a masterpiece. It shows us how problematic and concerning the American society really is. I had to stop at some point and take a break for a few days. It moved me on a spiritual level. The monster depicted in this show,I can't even say his name,preyed and butchered so many beautiful people of color because the society allowed him. Because the police forces weren't concerned with those people well beings because of their skin color. The white cops actually enabled this mad man. They even got awarded. This series is simply put a masterpiece and needs to be seen by every white person out there especially. This should be even showed in schools to teach the kids about the danger of white privilege .Unfortunately,things didn't really change that much since then. Society is still racist and discriminatory and that is very concerning. We are better than this."
10.0,19 October 2022,"Dahmer is a very well made and well acted dramatisation of the life of Jeffrey Dahmer, as if there wasn't a character that Evan Peters couldn't portray but overall it was hard work to watch and not because of the unpleasant subject matter. The series bounces around exploring Dahmer's life as a young man, his serial killer years and then his life in prison, it also focuses on

The first thing that irks me about the series is that it skirts around the more horrific, gory details. That in itself isn't a bad thing but it means that you don't really get the feeling for what a monster Dahmer was and as such there are times you almost start feeling bad for him, the lack of horrific detail also means it can get quite repetitive with each case almost identical. He goes to a club, picks up generally a gay black individual and drugs them (it's then just implied that the person is killed and disposed of).

The second thing is that it feels very slow paced and drawn out with lots of scenes largely irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The episode featuring Tony (Silenced) was excellent it gives you a feel for the victim beforehand, as you get to see his life and build a connection before he is eventually introduced to Dahmer and the inevitable happens but the following episode focusing on his neighbour (Cassandra) feels very repetitive and unnecessary, in the opening episode we see her shouting and screaming at the police that she has been warning them for ages about Jeff, this is enough to set the scenario and having multiple scenes about her complaining about the smell and the noise just feels excessive (as a viewer, we get it). There are also many other scenes which feel like they don't add anything to the story."
10.0,27 September 2022,"If you know the story of Jeffrey Dahmer, there are no spoilers. If you don't, there are spoilers in my review.

A must watch, great acting, in a true story about an evil human being that walked the earth scot-free for a awful long time before he got caught.

The Dahmer story in ten gutwrenching episodes. The failure of the police to follow up on calls that were made by his neighbour Glenda Cleveland. The neighbour that was dismissed a thousand times and had they listened, there could have, would have, should have been less victims.

There is some great acting by Evan Peters because at no point you feel bad for Dahmer, or even relate a little bit. Richard Jenkins as his dad, Lionel Dahmer, gives a great performance aswell, and Niecy Nash as the ignored neighbour Glenda Cleveland aces her part.

You can almost smell the decay, sweat, stench, mold and the bloodsoaked matrass but the worst smell of the entire series is the story about how this Dahmer got away with his crimes for so long, and how little there was done for the (families of) boys and men who went missing, and how little there was done by authorities for the victims, letting each person who watches this, to have an opinion on who is to blame, if any. But the real 911 call by Glenda at the end of one of the episodes, is witness to the devil may care attitude by the authorities involved, because (so it seems) it was all happening in the black, poor and gay community. So no one, except for her, really cared.

All in all an amazing story telling by. Ryan Murphy (why, at first, I thought they would steer from the true story but the absolutely did not) about a serial killer that didn't have to make so many victims, had they listened to Glenda. Cleveland in the first place.

There are no spoilers for people who know the story. And one can go into detail about the disorders Dahmer may have suffered from, but sometimes some people are just plain evil.

This story does not claim anything about what might have been, or gone wrong with him, it just tells the story of an evil man that for a long time, got away with murder."

9.0,2 October 2022,"My Review -Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story My Rating 8/10

I firmly hold the view that censorship should be left up to our individual free choice after all the remote stop button is always at hand . However in this case I think Netflix or The Producers of Dahmer did have a moral obligation to let the relatives of the victims of the monstrous Jeffrey Dahmer know that this ten part series was in production ,especially if they were being mentioned by name in the series.

Rita Isbell, sister of victim Errol Lindsey, wrote an essay for Insider where she states I feel like Netflix should've asked if we mind or how we felt about making it.

Disturbing subject matter like cannibalism, body dissection ,necrophilia and ritual killing of course is distressing and has been depicted before in many movies like Silence of the Lambs, Seven, The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo to name a few but the difference with Dahmer is that it depicts horrible murders some of which occurred just over 30 years ago . Many of the people involved are still living and if they saw this series ,which I doubt they it would could definitely be traumatised .

Apparently the Jeffrey Dahmer killings and his story are well known to my American friends but until I saw this series I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer or as he was named the Milwaukee Cannibal or the Milwaukee Monster.

This series like most made today is in my opinion is far to long and drawn out at ten episodes.

It's a Netflix horror drama series and a very grim tale about one of America's most notorious serial killers. It's largely told from the point of view of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims and his family background.

The series also effectively exposes the police incompetence and apathy that allowed Dahmer to go on his multiyear killing spree. The series dramatises at least ten instances where Jeffrey Dahmer was almost apprehended but then ultimately let go including an astounding scene where a deluded Judge virtually pats him on the head and sends him back out into the community.

The success of Ryan Murphy's interpretation of this horrible tale of murder and mayhem for me lie in the casting of the actors that portray the characters involved . The star is Evan Peters who is no stranger to Ryan Murphy's horror genre appearing regularly in American Horror Story in various roles and in Pose as Stan Bowes is spellbindingly compulsive as Jeffrey Dahmer . He segues between evil madness to almost please note I said almost rational behaviour.

A few rare times in this over nine hour marathon I almost had some empathy or understanding for him due to his traumatic childhood. He has to be unhinged in some way with an absent ineffectual homophobic father who encouraged his son to butcher and dissect roadkill as a bonding exercise plus a traumatised hostile mother who was much more than on the verge of a nervous breakdown at the end of her marriage . This upbringing would not equip or encourage any young child gay or straight to have any sort of functional existence the result of this neglect would surely have contributed to his insane behaviour .

The actors cast as the parents are wonderful Richard Jenkins as Lionel Dahmer and Molly Ringwald as Jeffrey Dahmer's mother Shari both give superb performances .

Other standouts for me were Michael Learned from The Waltons fame in this role she plays Jeffrey Dahmer's grandmother living under the same roof with a serial killer for a grandson , who lies and justifies his actions when she dares to suspect something is drastically wrong.

Her fragility and mental capacity especially when his moods turn to rage deteriorates causing her grandson to leave home where he is free to continue his carnage and is free to hunt out his victims.

The other standout for me among a wonderful ensemble cast is Niecy Nash who plays Glenda Cleveland Dahmer's next-door neighbour who lives in the apartment building when he moves in she becomes suspicious.

This is when the worst of Dahmer's murderous and cruel rampage of stalking men in Bars drugging them and luring them back to his apartment takes place. Glenda Cleveland knows something hideous is going on by the stench and the screams that she hears through the air vents but her reports to the Police are ignored and she is just treated as another black woman being hysterical.

As usual Ryan Murphy the series writer and creator and his team have been accused of taking so much ""artistic license"" that the show does not bear a great deal of resemblance to the facts of the case.

I'm not sure if that's so I suspect that's true but I doubt if any television or movie adaptation of actual crime events has ever not used artistic licence ?

It's a dramatic adaptation of events not a true life documentary so in fairness to Ryan Murphy who also went over the top with Inside Look: The Assassination of Gianni Versace - American Crime Story . Ryan Murphy is a storyteller and never lets the truth get in the way of a good story that was most evident in his series Hollywood 2020 .

This series apparently has been one of the most watched series of the year while the disturbing subject matter certainly wouldn't appeal to everyone it's very well done .

This series reminded me of a similar controversy concerning a movie depicting events surrounding factual violent killings being made.

That negative publicity caused audiences to stay away in droves .

It was the excellent 2021 movie Nitram which was about the events leading up to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania . That movie was also an attempt to understand why and how the atrocity occurred . It also had a fine cast that starred Caleb Landry Jones, Judy Davis and Anthony LaPaglia .

These movies I think do serve a purpose and took me back to the 1960's in Sydney when young men were being murdered by William MacDonald The Mutilator, who was Sydney's Most Disturbed Serial Killer.

It truly was a dangerous time and if this series about Jeffrey Dahmer alerts one young man to be suspicious of anyone they don't know taking them home or offering them a drink that they can't see being made it is worth the effort of watching and it certainly deserves to be seen ."
7.0,22 September 2022,"Evan Peters has potrated Jeffery Dahmer, amazingly well. You could visually see the works of an evil psychopath though the screen. Don't get me wrong I was totally creeped out on some parts. So much so I had to look away but this just goes to show how much of a good job he has done. I would definitely say this is worth a watch.

It also shows us the racism/prejudice that was happening to these people at the time and what many people will still have to endure today. It also asks the question. If Jeffery was killing only straight white men would he have gotten away with it for so long? Probably not!"
10.0,24 September 2022,"Not only was this the best serial killer series I have ever seen, but it is the best series in general that I have seen in awhile. Every aesthetical and technical aspect of this film deserves a standing ovation, from the cinematography, acting, editing, and storytelling.

To all of the negative reviews due to it being ""gross and disturbing,"" that's kind of the point. This is a non-fiction piece based off of one of America's most deadly serial killers. It would not be nearly as effective if they left out the disturbing details and made it PG.

That said, don't watch it if you can't handle it. It will make your stomach turn inside out, but you won't be able to turn it off."
6.0,6 October 2022,"Evan Peters does a fantastic job! He is legit creepy yet doesn't force the creepiness. He portrays Dahmer as a socially awkward person who really is naturally curious about doing all these horrific acts to people in a mentally sick sort of way.

The slow burn is good and creepy at first. However, it does feel like it drags a bit. The pacing can and should be varied depending on the situation. The courtroom and media frenzy could have benefitted from a faster pace. Slow burn is appropriate for the victim's family's depression in the wake of the trial.

There are some legitimate issues that are interesting but may be missed opportunities. There are minority issues, cop unprofessionalism issues, questioning if it's right for the infamous to have cult celebrity status, questioning if it's right for religion to cleanse the sins of serial killers... Netflix only hints at them without pushing them too much.

Richard Jenkins does a good job, too. His transformation as the younger to older father was well-executed.

Interesting take on Dahmer... all in all a little bit of a fuzzy kaleidoscope into the whole ordeal that feels a tad bit incomplete at the end, be it about Dahmer or his family or his victims or his neighbor (who somehow gets a lot of time at the end). 10 episodes may be a little long, considering."
1.0,23 September 2022,"Played the role professionally than Jeremy Renner in Dahmer(2002). As a troubled criminal mentality, which makes the series more intense in every episode. The flashbacks of the old events from time to time is an excellent idea so that we can see what Jeffrey was like and what changed his thinking pattern to this stage. Most of the stories mentioned about the victims were also interesting. I do not want to forget the role of the great actor Richard Jenkins and his role in the series and his attempts to reach the mind of his son. Excellent series I recommend to the documentaries crime fans hope you gonna love it guys."
8.0,1 October 2022,"I like the show but it reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite if he was a serial killer instead of a high school kid running for class president. I'm just waiting for Pedro, uncle Rico, and Kip to come out at any moment. I also find it weird how with all these serial killer shows that it almost seems like they're trying to get you to have empathy for ppl that did unspeakable acts to other human beings. Other than that I like the show a lot, it reminds me of the show Mindhunter which I really liked. The show also shows how easy it is to turn a blind eye to suspect behavior when it's a family member or love one doing it."
10.0,24 December 2022,"Really well made. Great actinu. Much better than the other Netflix tv series. I saw the documentary a few times and read alot about the case. Probably one of the best docu drama ever. The tv series follows events very closely and in detail. He had a sickness and he was insane but somehow the court felt he was not insane.

The series also exposes the racist police who gave Dahmer white privilege, letting him off so many times.

The story is well written, the script is excellent. It's definitely one of the best tv series from Netflix I seen. The tv series is gripping , slow sometimes but tense. Its slow in beginning but in end it gets better and better."
9.0,4 October 2022,"The acting was great at times, the content was quite the bit dry. I went into it with high expectations looking for wow and fascination and it just wasn't there. The facts were weighted by a whole lot of fiction and it wasn't terribly imaginative. An entire episode was nearly silent and dreadfully boring. I'm a huge fan of true crime and I'm aware that people LOVE this show but it's just a skosh above average. It has a lot of ""times we live in"" reference woven throughout and leans quite heavily on racial injustice, sexual orientation, police disapproval all of which are exaggerated beyond rational interpretation. I lost most interest by episode 6 and rated it accordingly. Just wasn't that great."
9.0,26 October 2022,"I am utterly disturbed. This is the only review I have ever written, and this is because this show is a grossly real interpretation of real evil. The reminder that someone like Jeffrey Dahmer lived and did this to men and families is not only upsetting but it really has an effect on my heart. I can't finish the show after episode six. It finally went too far to where it was beyond me to even finish the show. This is what evil looks like. I'm not afraid of it, just saddened deeply by it and the thought that this show would be allowed to air for the public. I don't recommend watching it. Just watch the interviews with Jeff. I was brought to tears by the horror of what he did in this show."
6.0,24 September 2022,"I enjoy how the show doesn't just focus on the horrific crimes performed by Jeffrey Dahmer, but also how they were carried out, such as the police officers who ignored the risk because he was a white male and didn't think to conduct a background check that may have saved many lives. The entire series, in my opinion, effectively portrays Jeffrey Dahmer's severe emotional problems and the need he felt to kill people. I believe it was a clever addition to include some background information to what, if not the precise cause, may have precipitated this reaction. I like how it demonstrates how the horrible deeds done had an impact on the relatives of the victims. I also find it interesting how his parents, and in particular his father, react to learning the truth; they still loved him despite knowing what he did. I adore Evan Peters's portrayal and how he was able to perfectly impersonate Jeffrey Dahmer, in my opinion. As a huge fan of horror myself, the series is one of my new favourites and I would highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys true crime or horror."
10.0,26 September 2022,"I really hope this series wins awards for the story telling and the acting. Evan Peters performance was perfect. The only thing is that I am curious to see / make sure the victims and victims families were compensated the money they deserve. Not a spoiler so don't worry about that. I started rewatching it as soon as I had finished it the first time through and it made all of the themes stronger and the layout even more clear as to the overall design. Ryan Murphy never disappoints with the music, colors, timelines, themes chosen etc. It has become a tradition for me to binge watch his content. Fresh, relevant viewpoints."
7.0,24 September 2022,
9.0,17 December 2022,"I didn't know the true story before i've watched it and it was big shocking for me. The script reminds me a bit of JOKER film - the perspective of a cruel person. The acting of all the cast is so good that it felt so real. Especially the main character.

The interesting thing is that you're not feeling you're watching a mini-series about a true serial killer, it's like a long movie and you can't stop watching from the first episode. Absolutely a classic example for binge!

You can't believe and it felt so disturbing to see how's the police ignored the witness and Dahmer's crimes. So sad to know how many lives could be saved.

If you haven't watched it yet - this is your time!"
7.0,22 September 2022,"The acting and screenplay is just superb, no denying that at all Evan Peters should get all the awards and recognition he deserves.

I agree with other comments though with regards to the fact that it's packed with a lot of filler and fiction. I feel like with subject matter such as this it should try to stick closer to the facts as opposed to all the fluff.

Also product placement can be a bug barer of mine, especially when it is included in a scene and the focus on the brand is completely unnatural. He had a drinking problem but was his drinking problem exclusively Budweiser? It starts to annoy me when every other scene the Bud brand is the sharpest thing in shot. Sometime laughably.. shame."
1.0,24 September 2022,"There are at least 3 reasons why I really liked this series: 1. It is not graphic or gory as I expected it to be (nothing like the Hannibal Lector movies) 2. The cast is brilliant. Jenkins delivered a poignant portrait of the father, Ringwald did ok as his wife, and the actress who played the neighbor is fantastic. But nothing compares to Evans' brilliant work as Dahmer. It was very easy to forget it was an actor and not the real Dahmer I was seeing on my TV 3. Unlike other serial killer films/series, this one doesn't end with the trial. There is a lot shown after the trial and I think some of the best parts of the story are in it."
9.0,28 September 2022,"If your expecting to watch Daumier become a serial killer your in the right place

But if you expect it all by his viewpoint then you are deeply disappointed

This series goes into how the victims were brought back how some got away and how they eventually found the monster who had basically just been waiting to die

One of the best episodes is with the bling guy which we've seen this done in master of none but they keep the creepiness in this version of a silence episode which actually is the loudest episode (not decibel loud)

It shows dahmers young and old life beginning to end

They don't get into the whole trial too much

But peters plays him to a tee

Def worth a watch

It's got to be better than Bridgerton right fellas 🤣"
10.0,5 October 2022,"Quite possibly the most worthwhile depiction of the Christian struggle I ever remember witnessing. Episode 10 is an accurate portrayal of societal views vs what is genuine salvation. None of us is perfect, not even remotely close, but there's eternal hope if we just ask for it with honesty and conviction. Do I think JD was saved? Based upon my research, I truly believe that yes, he was saved. This takes absolutely nothing away from the heinous monster acts that he committed, and the unspeakable anguish that he inflicted that lives on decades later. This episode captures the struggle without making the participants look stupid. Hollywood never gets it right, well, almost never."
9.0,24 September 2022,
10.0,9 October 2022,Was really enjoying this until I found out that Glenda cleavland actually lived in an entirely different building than Jeffrey dahmer did. This is just another example of wokeness. I don't understand why Netflix and other Hollywood productions have to push there narrative in our faces with everything they make. It's getting to be ridiculous with all the In accuracies in all of there productions. Also the police officer scene where they received officer awards of the year was false aswell. Anyway that's just my take on this I didn't enjoy it at all and if your looking for some false narrative to push there agenda then this Is for you.
7.0,23 September 2022,"For true crime fans, I believe that we all have an opinion about who is the worst of all serial killers. This is an terrifying scope into the life of Jeffery Dahmer, possibly most terrifying of them all. The cast is brilliant to say the least. Evan Peters has shown himself to be in the same class as hard-working actors like Alexander Skarsgârd and Michael Shannon. However, the unsung hero of the cast is without a doubt, Niecy Nash. Her desperate cries for help for Dahmer's victims makes the story gut wrenching. Her role in Monster will give you chills thinking about how you felt when you watched.""When They See Us""."
10.0,26 September 2022,"Don't take this the wrong way, but as a lover of all things true crime, I've seen many drama series attempt to portray Dahmer but all have fallen short of capturing the horrors of this man in a realistic way. It's like everyone has been too afraid of how the audience would react. No one ever took the time for any character development so we could try to understand what happened to Dahmer, how he thought and felt... how many scenarios could have played out differently that may have changed the fate of so many lives. How he managed to lure so many innocent lives. What actually led to him to take such drastic, unforgivable actions. And so they diluted the story in so many ways that it always left me wanting more, feeling like they barely scratched the surface.

This series isn't for the faint of heart. Was I disturbed? Yes. Was I disgusted? Of course. Did I need to press pause to ask myself, do I really want to continue... yup.

I'll wrap this up by saying this.

Is it a hard watch? Absolutely. But let's be real - who presses ""play"" expecting to NOT be disturbed? I don't think it's fair to rate this accordingly saying ""it's too hard to watch"". Guys - the man was a sadistic, murdering cannibal who kept pieces, if not entire bodies for his own pleasure. If you're not familiar with the story, listen to a podcast. Watch a series from cable TV. This series goes ALL in.

Dahmer is a cinematic triumph. Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters truly outdid themselves with this series and it's exactly what I've been waiting to see for so many years. Not because I idolize him, but because I feel like this truly depicts his depravities leaving the viewers knowing exactly what happened, to whom and how.

My heart goes out to the families of those impacted. I can't imagine the press and ads they've been subjected to, but let's not take it out on the cast and producers for taking on such a heinous, once in a lifetime story and totally nailing it."
7.0,30 September 2022,"Evan Peters captures the dull, blunted tone and unnervingly icy - I'm here but not really here - mannerisms of Jeff Dahmer. His acting is on another level and much better than all of the others who have played the man, the monster. While watching Evan Peters in this role, I was reminded of another actor, another character, this one fictitious. None other than Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite. Which makes me wonder, knowing that Evan, off set, has a mordacious sense of humor, if he channeled Napoleon D just for some inside craps and giggles. Kind of the way he channeled Pacino's Serpico in Mare of Eastown. Aside from Peters' profound, if somewhat, at times, derivative performance, Niecy Nash is special as the nosey (in more ways than one) neighbor - glad she passed on that gift sandwich from Jeff, and Rich Jenkins logs his finest outing since Six Feet Under and/or Step Brothers. I'm glad they showed not only the monstrous side of JD but also the human side. It's important to show the latter in these kinds of shows as it may help with prevention of crime in the future; you know, early warning signs and all. Also, the sets, especially Jeff's apartment, look so real and scuzzy that you may be inclined to take a long Silkwood shower after viewing half an episode. In the end, it is the palpable, oozing eeriness that will get you and haunt you long after you view this."
10.0,23 September 2022,"Evan Peters is an absolute tour de force in this: he captured that utter blankness to perfection. Actually, the casting all round is excellent and I doff my cap to the acting skills of all those involved.

It's not an easy watch by any means; there is a huge sadness in respect of the institutional racism that allowed Dahmer to continue killing for so long.

This series also brought to attention the absolute destruction that Dahmer wrought on his victim's families; there is often far too much emphasis on the experience of the perpetrator. This series absolutely tackled the terrible pain left behind. My only (tiny) criticism would be a lack of focus on Dahmer's later attempts to convince the world that he was 'I'll'. He wasn't in the legal sense, he knew exactly what he was doing.

Overall, cannot praise it highly enough."
7.0,29 September 2022,"I don't ever write a review before I finish a series, never, but this? After just one episode (and admittedly, knowing how good Evan Peters is & how fantastic Ryan Murphy is I feel like it's OK to 'jump the gun' on this one), I can already tell that this is simply FANTASTIC!

Hopefully I can update this after I've seen the whole thing but one episode is all it took for me to know that this is just GREAT.

I remember the story so well because the whole country was so captivated by it, but Ryan Murphy makes everything extremely frightening & again, Evan Peters simply IS Jeffrey Dahmer.

There's something that Ryan Murphy does in all his shows that just goes above & beyond when it comes to the level of fear & reality/realistic portrayal of his characters & it definitely shines through in this series!

A + +."
4.0,26 September 2022,
8.0,14 October 2022,"The most intense series I have ever seen. The direction is brilliant and the acting is flawless, specially Evan Peters. He definitely deserves an award for it. They should include this category (OTT) as well.

The first 5 episodes almost feel like too much to handle, but you still enjoy every moment of them. The series felt a little dragged out towards the end, but overall it was engaging. Was not a big fan of the timeline shifting back and forth every now and then, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.

Thought 'Mindhunter' was the most intense series I watched; until 'Dahmer'. Hope they make another series on the other serial killer they introduced at the end of Dahmer."
9.0,23 October 2022,"This is one of these stories that keeps pulling you in. Obviously because of the chilling true story behind it, but also because of the way the show is build up. It truly explores the life of Dahmer where the main focus is not on the gruesome killings themselves (most of it isn't even shown!) but the story behind it and how someone could get that sick and twisted to do these things. Because of this build up the show can be slow at times. I myself quite frequently found myself wandering of and sometimes even turning it off halfway through an episode. But it keeps drawing you back, wanting to know more. This is also because of the brilliant and oh so subtle acting of Evan Peters. It is a real shame though that Netflix/the producers didn't take the effort to include families involved in the actual story first. It's not that they HAVE to do that, but with sensitive stories like this they SHOULD have."
10.0,22 September 2022,Each episode is different as it adds more depth and interest to Dahmer as you learn about what his mind set was and what drove him to do the things he did but also makes u hate and despise of him doing these things to innocent people. Evan peters as Dahmer is a great casting choice as he is able to embody the character as if he was actually Dahmer and not someone trying to play him. The director has a distinct style which suits Dahmer as a character but the darkness and creepiness to the show making you feel more creeped out and disgusted even more than you already do. Another part that is well done is how true and factual the show is to what Dahmer did and acted in real life and how what the police didn't do to arrest Dahmer earlier in his spree rather than later and how we can't do nothing or complain about it as it's already happened.

7.0,20 September 2024,"Lyle and Erik are not monsters and never will be. So much wasted potential on a terrible, poorly researched show. Despite glimmers of hope here and there, for me this whole thing just fell flat on its face. There is no questioning Dahmer was a horrible person, a ""monster"" as the title suggests. However, Lyle and Erik are two very misunderstood men who grew up in a nightmare of a household. At the ages of 18 and 21, Lyle and Erik had the mental and emotional maturity of 8 and 10 year olds. This is from years and years of mental, physical, emotional, and horrible horrible HORRIBLE sexual abuse. Not only is it completely and utterly confusing, but the showrunners decided to commit blatant character assassination on two men who were abused their entire lives, and are still paying the ultimate price for a rash and impulsive decision which they regretted the rest of their lives."
10.0,16 November 2022,"Evan Peters smashed this role! His Midwest accent was spot on, not to mention his overall demeanor was spot on to Dahmer. This series did a great job of showing a peak into Dahmer's childhood. It all was very convincing and honestly pulled at my heartstrings at times. It makes ""My Friend Dahmer"" with Ross Lynch look silly. In my opinion, this is an excellent depiction at how the right actors and directing play such a crucial role in making a story convincing. I could follow along with the story and not be distracted by bad acting or prop use.

The grungy dark scenes of Dahmer's apartment were chilling. I loved the pacing of the series, and it was exciting to follow."

6.0,23 September 2022,"I was 10 years old when Dahmer was caught, so I knew about it, just not the details obviously.

This series was EXCELLENT. The acting was superb by the entire cast. I hope they win awards. The accent was a bit over done, however, it's hard to get our accent right here in this neck of the woods without going overboard. It is creepy, it is gross-but they make you imagine the gore with sounds. It will make your stomach upset, and will make you feel quite disturbed by the end of the series. I gave this a 9 star review because of the acting, the level of creepiness, and the unanswered questions I still have about the aftermath. I'm actually thinking of reading his(Dahmer's)father's book for more insight. I'm positive the writer used some information from there."
1.0,25 September 2022,This is a must see! Evan Peters plays a terrific Jeffrey Dahmer in this superbly detailed biopic drama. Ryan Murphy does it again with another binging series that'll shape future drama shows. The camera work is simple yet effective with the lighting sometimes falls flat and overly dim lighting to dramatise things in scenes but nonetheless the show is simply worth watching. The soundtrack is very good when showing different timelines. The handheld is very effective also so well done to whoever shot this. Some scenes with Dahmer and his victims in the hotel seemed to drag a bit whereas I liked the tension it was portraying. Interesting take for a serial killer drama.
10.0,27 September 2022,"Overall I liked the series and the way they direct it Evan Peters acting was amazing and successfully Richard Jenkins was Legendary in the role of his father he was astonishing and so convenient and deserve an Oscar :) My only reservation about the series is the prolongation, it could have been easly done in 5 or 6 episodes ; But overall it was not borring at all.

Another thing I liked, the director succeeded to highlight Dahmer homosexuality without any repelling scenes and this was pure genius.

It's worth watching for sure Also shooting the series in classic way give it the lovely 70s and 80s style."
10.0,24 September 2024,"Dahmer - Evan peters absolutely killed it in this Dark Soap opera about Jeffrey Dahmer,the Milwaukee Monster. This show depicts the making of the monster and indulges you in the point of view of the families that were affected. The show takes you to the journey how Jeffrey Dahmer did the things which we can't even imagine and almost tries to depict why he did those things. Evan peters,oh gosh he just was the perfect person to play Dahmer, everything he did was absolutely identical to the real Jeff dahmer,from articulation to accent and from Physique to walking style. This series is a must watch."
9.0,13 October 2024,"I'm not a fan of season 1. The narrative is very confusing, sometimes going backward and sometimes going forward. The perspective is very confusing too, sometimes from the point of view of the victims, sometimes from the point of view of the Dahmers, and sometimes from the point of view of the witnesses. I would prefer to see the story from one point of view than from multiple points of view. I guess it's because the writers are trying to convey too many messages to the audience and they kind of get lost in the middle. I heard that season 2 is better than season 1 so I will watch it next week and get back to this review afterwards."
8.0,22 September 2024,"I think this monster series is brilliant, very well acted with a lot of detail(I am aware there is plenty of entertainment purpose viewing as well!) Evan Peters really got into int when he portrayed Jeffery Dahmer, I think it is probably the best version of the story so far, I know what he (JD) did was Heinous and extremely disturbing, but to have an actor take on such a role shows just how talented they are. I binged watch this series, The first and second seasons, I do enjoy true crime so when they brought this to Netflix I had to indulge.

I am just eager to find out who will feature in the next season?

I would definitely recommend."
7.0,3 October 2022,"Couldn't find my original brief review to amend so I'll start over. Like many other reviewers, I quit watching after ep 6. It just got too gross for me. But I did complete watching the entire series. The acting was excellent. Peters was a little wooden but I imagine Dahmer was too. After all, he was pretending to be an actual human being. He didn't know how to act real. I don't think his dad played a part in making him a killer. This person was born strange. Even tho he accepted Christ in prison, he got what he deserved by another inmate who beat his head in. I'm glad his dad was not allowed to profit off the book he wrote. I need to watch a comedy."
10.0,28 September 2022,"Great performance by Evan Peters but as a series it is far too long. The pace is so slow the story barely seems to advance. Too many scenes are replicants of previous and seem unecessary. At times I was confused thinking I was watching an episode I had already seen but in fact hadn't.

I can imagine anybody who didn't have any detailed knowledge of his crimes would be shocked by this but to me there was nothing new. I've seen many better versions of real life murderers than this. An opportunity missed and it just boils down to the pace and length of the series. It could have been told in half of the time."
7.0,2 October 2022,"I never knew Jeffery Dahmar was that sick and twisted. All the things he did to others were just atrocious. I couldn't believe he was capable of doing these things. Heck, I wouldn't think any human would be able to do these things.

The main character Evan Peters was fantastic! All of the actors did a great job in this movie. I remember reading about Dahmar years ago but this movie made these things come to life.

This is Avery disturbing true story of a man who did awful things. I knew several people who just kept talking about the movie so I decided to watch it. I'm glad I did take the time to watch the movie."
10.0,29 September 2022,
7.0,27 August 2024,"I think they should make a full series on John Wayne Gacy. The actor who played him in The Dahmer series was brilliant. Please could the makers of this brilliant series consider doing a Gacy series with same actor. I am sure it would be another frightening journey into the mind of a sick killer.

The lead actor who plays Jeffrey Dahmer is brilliant and very convincing. I hope the series will continue, and have different killers on it. Maybe one with Henry Lee Lucas too would be very good. All I can say is I watched the jeffrey Dahmer series twice and its one of Netflix best series thank you very much."
1.0,22 September 2022,"By default, I love Evan Peters... and his rendition of Jeffrey Dahmer is superb! Niecy Nash should get an Emmy for her role as Glenda Cleveland. The whole series is gut wrenching, it takes you to an uncomfortable place but you can't stop watching.

Evan is an amazing actor, I have no idea how he was able to finish the series, in any case, he needs to do some serious counseling.

I remember when this was happening, I was 14 at the time, lived in Chicago. So many stories being told and so many people missing. It was horrible to witness the victim's families pain during the trial. And the actress who launched herself to him... it reminded me of watching that even in live tv.

May the victims rest in peace... congratulations to Evan Peters on a praise worthy performance.

And of course, Ryan Murphy.... thank you for bringing uncomfortable stories to the mainstream.

D'Eva Longoria."
8.0,6 October 2022,"I have IMDb for more than 12 years I guess. And this is the first time ever I am writing a rating about any movie or series I ever watched. Why? Because I am amazed and frustrated at the same time. I gave it 8 stars though I would have given it more, but I just didn't like the fact that the director and Netflix are putting so much light on the damn "" Dahmer "" he was a savage a serial killer, a person who ate the flesh of his victims , a sex freak and an alcoholic. However I feel like they tried kinda to make him look like a star and not point out the fact in the end that he is nothing. The acting is cool, the story is well written and told , but at some point I felt like Netflix is kinda normalizing the act of this butcher, I am really worried for the young generation watching this kind of stuff I mean Dhamer at some point he admitted his obsession with the criminal sketch. So now you're offering the young generation a 3D way to crimes. You ruined it in the end. What sucks more is that after the release of the series his sunglasses were sold in the auction for 150K . Such a shame . Seriously this series might affect vulnerable persons badly because you made him seem like a star which he isn't. He was nothing."
10.0,6 December 2022,"Dahmer possibly the most notorious serial killer of all time in my opinion. He was an attractive young blonde male who had a way with words and he used this to lure his victims this netflix series beautifully chillingly hauntingly portrays this and beautifully acted out by evan peters that boy deserves an oscar more than that! I have watched many documentaries and shows on dahmer but this has got to be the most clear and percise view on who dahmer was why he did what he did and even the actors picked to play the roles of all the characters were so close to the real people in real life for example dahmer played by evan evan really got his speech on point and the looks, dahmers dad his voice was so much like he was in real its actually quite scary you cant tell the difference between the two they are So alike!"
10.0,23 September 2022,"I followed the case in the 90s and was utterly shocked by the incompetence and biggotry of the police at the time.

I saw all biopics and documentaries available so I was definitely looking out for this one.

From the moment Lionel (Richard Jenkins) gets informed about his son's crimes, you are trapped inside a series that will leave you completely drained and exhausted when finished.

Evan Peters captures successfully the depraved mind of Dahmer. He genuinely scared me.

The visualization of the darkness of the case is perfectly set and the songs used are here so disturbing because I used to have an amazing time dancing to them. Absolute must see!"
10.0,15 October 2024,"So this series started out amazing. After several episodes I gave it 10 out of 10. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. But something changed. The story began to drag with protracted unnecessary dialogues and monologues. It became confusing, and after a while irritating. The last episode was the worst. I won't spoil it, but I will say that watching (and listening to) the prosecutor drove me mad. Was I supposed to feel that way? I don't know. I don't know what the producer was up to... it was all very artistic and creative, but I would have liked something based more in fact than fantasy. I love TV series based on real life, but what a disappointment. The 6/10 is for the first episodes which were (and remain) outstanding. As for Dahmer? Well made but sooo dark!"
6.0,20 September 2024,
8.0,15 October 2022,"A biopic of Jeffrey Dahmer, a man who killed (and sometimes ate) 17 victims over a 13-year period from the 1970s to the 1990s. This is probably by far the most accurate account of events we are ever going to get regarding the life of Jeff Dahmer, The Milwaukee Cannibal. Evan Peters embodied this role in such a unique way, it's not only thrilling but kind of chilling at how well he can truly play a not proven but definitely undeniably, a psycho. The fact Jeffrey Dahmer was never actually insane says alot about the world, who is really insane?

This show was a great reenactment of such tragic events, must watch!"
6.0,3 November 2022,"Evan Peters knocked this role out of the park. It's almost disturbing how well he plays the role of Jeffrey Dahmer and how even his mannerisms and cadence of speech match those of Dahmer.

This series is not for the faint of heart or those with a weak stomach. It is heart-breaking and gory and uncomfortable and difficult to watch in many scenes, but the true story of what Dahmer did is heart-breaking and uncomfortable. For those leaving a bad review because of these aspects, maybe should do some research before diving into a series about a cannibalistic serial killer. It's not a cute or funny story."
9.0,21 September 2022,I love Evan Peters I think he really does great with getting into his roles he has dhamer down for most part except for the speaking yes I believe dhamer wasn't a man of very many words but the accent he has off which if hard to pin point that accent it just kind of bothers me? I think my friend Dahmer did better in the accent area I know stupid thing to critique but that's what I didn't like from the jump. So far they're doing great with the facts which many people will overlook and for Evan Peters he's transformed into a dhamer look alike. The plot is very slow something's I do believe could of been taken out but then I believe it wouldn't be the full story. Overall accent aside I do like it a lot Evan Peters did a great job!
6.0,27 September 2022,"This is a tale of two cities in many regards. It is a grisly, detailed account of the life and killings of Jeffrey Dahmer. Dahmer is one of the most notorious serial killers of the 20th Century. His capture, his killings, his trial, and death are pretty public so this account does a great job at reacting this aspects, but takes the viewer deeper and further. The downside is, perhaps, it is much longer than it needs to be. 10 episodes could have been reduced to 6, easily, and it would have been better. There is no question Evan Peters' performance is nothing short of brilliant. He embodies the almost catatonic and conscienceless of the man himself in his performance. Niecy Nash and Richard Jenkins are very compelling in this. With Ryan Murphy at the helm you know this is filled with graphic sexual perversion and violence, but it does feed the story. The Direction, supporting cast's acting, and cinematography are very good. The story pays great attention to details, especially of the time period. As always music is vital to Murphy's story."
1.0,13 November 2022,
9.0,24 September 2024,"The show is excellent and captures the American experience in it's totality.

Greed.

Greed will make you and your circle, mosters.

The main characters carry the series and the cast is exceptional. But every ensemble has stars and Mosters is loaded with actors who all shine.

Javier, Ari, Nicholas, and Cooper carry the series.

Nathan Lane shines every time he is on screen.

Ari and Nathan deliver on their respective roles and their appearances are integral to the success of the production.

Nicholas as Lyle captures the charm Lyle held. Cooper as Erik conveys the innocence lost by Erik.

It's a story we all have heard of as Americans. Whether somethings are embellished for entertainment purposes the production called Monsters is enthralling from beginning to end."
9.0,9 October 2022,
9.0,6 October 2022,"A morbid in depth depiction of Dahmer backstory and everyone involved in his life. Evan Peters defiantly deserves an Emmy next go around! I've seen other Dahmer stories/movies those were pretty good; the series is more in depth and I didn't realize how the dad picked up animal carcasses with his son no wonder he became more disturbed overtime. I love anything about serial killers or stories about anyone mentally disturbed and this is one of the best out there. I absolutely love the way the directing is so smooth, engaging, and well made in every aspect. I understand how Evan Peters is changed forever after this role.

Edit: Holy Cow the Menendez story is one of the best ever. So captivating and well made! Fun fact Ari Graynor and Larry Clarke had small parts in The Sopranos."
10.0,5 October 2022,"Dahmer was decent. It was a good show to have around for background noise while I was playing games on my phone. I must confess, if my wife hadn't been interested I wouldn't have even given it a shot. The show jumps around a lot so you must pay attention if you want to keep timelines accurate. What I loved? Accuracy. Every time I ran a fact check the show was spot on. What I didn't like? The not-so-subtle excuses for his behavior and blatant product placement. The acting from Evan Peters is beyond incredible! I found the show dragged on, could have been half as long and delivered just as powerful a story."
6.0,9 October 2022,"Way overrated and it's too boring to watch drama wise and too shallow to watch documentary wise.

Drama wise, for something to be rated 8 and above, it should be at least interesting and makes me eager to wait for what's going to happen in the next episode.

Documentary wise, it is too shallow in-terms of information presented and the character deep psychological issues. Additionally, other characters in the series are just presented for the sale of having a series. No deep thoughts were put into creating those characters.

Probably I would not have written all this review if series ratings was less than 6 or 5 and if it hasn't gotten amongst the top 10 watched series... bla bla."

7.0,24 September 2022,"They could have got any skinny white actor to play a crazed, deprived version of Jeffrey Dahmer, and it would have been a good story but they did something very special here. They focused on the mid-western ""Milwaukee"" accent and muffled persona. This was the first thing that stuck out to me, as Jeffrey wasn't a man of too many words, but when he did speak it was clear, he was a product of his surroundings. They got the right actor with the perfect range for this role. It's more than just the horrors that one man inflicted, it's about everyone in his orbit. The families, friends, neighbors and businesses that he left cratering in his wake. He lived like he was invisible but the ripples from his life are being felt far and wide. This is a phenomenal series, everyone put their heart and soul into it and every scene is heartfelt and powerful. It's a must-see."
10.0,27 September 2022,"I absolutely loved this series. The producers and directors rocked this film. This entire film was wonderfully made, excellent work, and thank you for making it. I noticed that this was all to the book almost 100% correct. I'm not sure why I have to have 400 characters for this but I guess I'll just keep talking and keep talking and let the thing record everything that I'm saying because this IMDb is making me do this. Not sure why but this film was very good and I am to be is making us do this and I'm not sure why or what the point of this is do you want us to keep talking keep talking about this or there's nothing more I can say about this. I am DB please take away the minimum characters. That's kind of silly."
7.0,24 September 2022,"Nobody in their right mind would start watching this thinking this was just going to be a Docuseries and that's it....not when it come to Dahmer and the heartbreaking stories of all the people that he impacted with the choices he took. It was not only hard to stomach but extremely consuming. If you're here to just see what he did then ok...you'll Get that...but we finally see the victims in the spotlight. Who they were and their families and how they were impacted by all of this. It is sad, it is dark and it was spectacular to say the least. Superb performance by Niecy Nash, Evan Peters, Richard Jenkin and Rodney Burford (to say the least)."
4.0,1 October 2022,
8.0,7 October 2022,"This was an outstanding mini series overall. I think it was majorly successful in two areas. First, it was authentic and true to reality. Evan Peters was amazing throughout and truly captured the personality and feeling of Dahmer in a wildly accurate way. The stories and scenes were accurate to the real life time line and showed how sick he is. Secondly, it did a really good job diving into the reasons and factors throughout his life that drove all of this to unfold. It was really engaging and interesting. My only area of feedback would be the timeline of how it was filmed. It was a little choppy and all over the place to follow. But great to watch."
9.0,15 October 2024,"I was intrigued to see this series because I remembered it all unfolding at the time. What I should have remembered now was that these type of series have so much fabrication in them, it's hard to know what's fact and what's fiction. And when it comes to something retelling of this magnitude, it needed to be more facts than filling in the pieces. The reason I gave it a 6 and not lower was purely the cast did a brilliant job, especially the actors playing the brothers. They were phenomenal in their ability to reach all the emotions portraying Lyle and Eric as close as they did. But if you're looking for a show that is going to give you the Facts, watch the other Netflix documentary on the Menendez Brothers."

7.0,1 October 2022,"The absolute disregard for the families of the victims is truly flabbergasting. How can you authorise to shoot a show without at least consulting the families of the victims that have and still are effected by this tragedy and horrific crime? They literally have to relive the most devastating moments in their lives once more, and for what? You're making a profit whilst they're reliving their most traumatising experiences again. How senseless can one truly be? I could even understand it if they gave some of the money to the victims' children. ... The victims have children and grandchildren. If the show benefited them in some way, it wouldn't feel so harsh and careless. It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed.

The families wasn't consulted, neither are they at the very least benefiting from the revenue, but the most shocking of all is the fact that they had ZERO knowledge of its production until it aired. The families of the victims have spoken out, and they're devastated and angry, and rightly so! I strongly urge people to consider what I've said, and if you have the slightest degree of empathy and compassion, I urge you to stand with the families to boycott such a vile production team, until, at the very least, the families benefit from the profits generated from this show."
9.0,1 November 2022,"I have been following Dahmer's case for couple of years now. Therefore, none of the ""shocking"" scenes actually shocked me. As a person who knows all the avaliable details I'd say the series portraited the whole situation pretty well. There were some shortcuts in the story but I guess the screen time was limited somehow. I especially like that they showed some little situation from Jeff's life that weren't widely known. They also brought more attention to his father who is guilty in a way but was able to con everyone (including his son) that he isn't. They nicely showed that everyone just tried to blame someone else to the point where Jeff had to take the blame only for himself."
6.0,23 September 2022,"Clarification: The ""American Indian"", Jamie, was 14 years old, not an adult. This was his first minor victim. Every other victim was portrayed correctly.

This was absolutely horrifying! I wasn't sure if I could handle it but with the deep dive into his parents that blends in so seamlessly I couldn't stop.

Evan has Dahmer nailed. This is probably the best portrayal of a serial killer I've seen.

Absolutely a must see but there was a lot I couldn't watch. Those scenes were short and I am a lightweight on blood and gore so keep that in mind.

I find myself very frustrated with a lot of people who could have stopped him a lot sooner.

This was brilliantly done with an excellent cast!"
10.0,23 September 2022,"Just finished the series and wow.

Usually I find TV series with similar attributes take a long time to get to the point. Not this series. Not at all!

Completely taken back and shocked, first episode in!

Actually had to have a few breaks between episodes.

Evan Peters did an outstanding job at portraying Jeffrey Dahmer. It felt like I was watching everything unfold in real time right in front of me.

I wish the final episode had more acknowledgement on the victims. There was only the last 10 seconds with small pictures. I would have loved maybe a slide each, maybe some details like if they had hobbies and siblings etc.

Must be hard for victims families to relive this. But I hope they know that their loved ones names and stories are reaching a whole new generation."
7.0,14 November 2022,"Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022) is a series my wife and I finally finished last night. The 10 episode series focuses on everything about Dahmer - his childhood, his victims, his neighbors, his family, his murders and ultimately how everyone was impacted around him while he was doing what he was doing and after. The one aspect not covered, likely because of potential blow back from the government, was his behavior while in the military and what led to his discharge...which is also an awful tale.

This series was created by Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy who also created Glee. The series stars Evan Peters (X-Men: Apocalypse), Richard Jenkins (Step Brothers), Molly Ringwald (Sixteen Candles), Niecy Nash (Reno 911) and Michael Learned (The Waltons).

Everything about this series is perfect, especially the way it makes you feel gross with every scene. It's honestly hard to watch and get through. The acting by the entire cast is stupendous, but Evan Peters delivers an Oscar caliber performance. The details in the story telling is outstanding and you also get a good feel for his mindset and approach to everything he did. You get the feeling his family tried not to know what was happening also. It's a frustrating series to watch because it was obvious there were numerous times he could have been stopped. The ultimate resolution for both Dahmer and his victims are well concluded even if not fulfilling.

Overall, this may be the greatest docuseries of all time. I'm excited to see what they do with the contract extension for three more series they got from Netflix. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
1.0,16 October 2024,"If I would have watched S02 first, or as a stand alone mini-series, I might gave given it a higher score. But being served boring and somewhat comical ""story"" of Menendez brothers after an actual monster as Dahmer is just misrepresenting Monsters as a whole. Watch S01, skip S02, wait for S03, they might do Ten Bundy or Manson family.

PS. Who asked for the Menendez brothers story in the first place? They were abused, they killed their abusers, they went to jail for their crime. It's full circle, there are no other victims or purpertrators. Who was this made for exactly?

Blablablabla 600 chars required."
10.0,3 October 2022,"The people making the show should have spoken to the families of the victims and the survivors because of course they should have. I don't know why they didn't. Perhaps they thought the poor people wouldn't go for it if they were told the show's intent, and why would they? Now the makers of the show have left themselves open to lawsuits, especially considering the show is re-traumatizing all of those people. Which, of course, raises the question, ""Why are they watching it?"" Maybe for closure? I don't know. If that's the case, great. Then again, I don't know what closure they could find in a TV show. Whatever. My sympathies are with them and have been with them for a long time.

With all that said, let's get to my review:

This show is everything that crappy Zac Efron Ted Bundy movie should've been!

Evan Peters gives a career-best performance as Jeffrey Dahmer! I've seen the interviews with the serial killer and I saw the serial killer, not Evan Peters.

Richard Jenkins was also really fantastic!

This is the first thing I've ever seen Niecy Nash in and now I want to see her in more!

All of the performances were really great. (Also, holy crap, Molly Ringwald!)

It offers more than just an insight into Jeffrey Dahmer's life and psyche.

The goals of this show are to inform, disturb, and upset you and it succeeds in all regards!

I like how it doesn't show the murders being committed, instead having you rely on your imagination. Makes it much more effective, not to mention respectful to the families of the victims and the victims themselves.

The music is very well-done and appropriately used!

It's incredibly well-shot and atmospheric!

The use of colors was great!

The directing was awesome!

It's very well-written!

The editing was very purposeful and unsettling. Although, sometimes the editing was a little annoying in the sense that it felt jarring when it jumped from the past to the present, and the present to the future. At times I felt like the pacing was off. And, personal point, I wish they had kept the whole freak out in the court scene. That actress did a great job by the way!

Hopefully they'll make more serial killer miniseries. Make one for Ted Bundy and recast Zac Efron. Other than the hacksaw scene his casting was the only good thing about that movie. And if these same people decide to make more shows, hopefully they will speak to the families of the victims and survivors of the respective killer.

If you haven't watched this then you should get right on that! But it's not for the faint of heart! This will likely be upsetting for people and it might even keep you up at night because of how blunt and visceral it is. There are images from the show that are permanently seared into my brain and every time I think of them I wince."

10.0,18 January 2023,"It was a great show with great acting until episode 7. From E7, the focus of the series gets less on dahmer and more and more on his neighbour glenda cleveland . From E8 its more Cleveland show than Dahmers story. Which makes the show boring. I mean she was a good woman who had suffered a lot, But she hasn't anything special or interesting for being a main character. It would make more sense if that focuse was on dahmer and his victim families. E9 was so boring.

Also, as a crime thriller series, i was expecting more from the court scenes. I was expecting a fabulous court scenes like better call saul or GOT. But , it was too casual and short."
7.0,6 October 2022,"My favorite character the ""neighbor"" did actually live next door nor did she even live in the same building!! And the cops were fired not given the ""cop of the year"" award. I don't understand why they can't tell a story how it actually was. Always have to change something to fit a narrative or to just make sure it wasn't about a white guy killing black men. Netflix is a propaganda machine and fooled me.

That being said, was entertaining and a good watch. Just wish they would tell the story as it actually happened and not how they feel it should be told.

Makes me wonder how much other stuff on Netflix is not factual."
9.0,8 October 2022,"This serial killer series are based on true events.

Evan Peters played Jeff Dahmer so credibly that I felt to watch his real life next to him. He should win the Oscar for best actor. Congratulations. The director sticked all the proofs and facts to a never seen miniseries before.

Be warned that each reconstruction of the murder scene contains bloody and violent pictures.

I think in no other thrillers came together so many elements and testimonies about his family and murder details. Questions are made about racism, police work and religion values. One the most important point in these episodes for me was the relation between the father and his son Jeff. I think that we all can learn from this behavior. A must see for strong nerves 8/10."
6.0,22 September 2022,Let me start to saying that Even peters did such an amazing performance. This show was the first that make me live into the skin and the mind of a SK it gave me chills in my bones . This show was well crafted and i really wish that netflix will make more seasons about other SK. These kind of individuals are nothing to cheer for they are horrible human beings and the show made that clear they didnt glorify any of it .they also showed us the consequences of his acts and how the surviving victims and their families coud never be the same . So BRAVO to all the people who worked on the show. Amazing.
10.0,23 September 2022,"The ted bundy movie was one of my favourite serial killer movies (the original 2002 one not the corny zack efron one) i thought that captured the weird demented mind of a serial killer great but this is pretty much on par but without any snippets of dark humour, this is just dark and morbid, i always knew Peters could pull something like this off though, great actor well done to him. Master of his craft, it must be hard putting yourself in the shoes of such a sick weird human being. Even his mannerisms are spot on and the voice is pretty close to, no disrespect to renner he did a good job but this version is better for me."
7.0,31 October 2022,"Simply Evan Peters and Niecy Nash perfect and impeccable performance, in addition to bringing up extremely important social issues for discussion: it's not about romanticizing anything, it never was. Instead, it allows us to problematize all the racism, prejudices and many others flaws in society, that would allow this horror to happen.

For sure, it was not to provoke shallow discussions about the social problems involved, which persist in American society. It's about the need that we have of learning with our social flaws, to reach an more fair, healthy and egalitarian society.

It really was a lot of courage and bravery from everyone involved, for the misunderstanding and controversy about the work was certainly known risk by them -- but it didn't stop those guys from making it real, for us, to us.

The producers (and everyone) nailed it! Give them all the awards, cause they tottaly deserves! 🏆👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
1.0,8 October 2022,"They really hit the nail on the head with the casting in this one WOW.

Evan Peter's is great. I feel like he's played characters like this before in American Horror Story.

I felt like the first half of this show was a lot better than the second half. The moments where Dahmer is attempting the murders made this show. These were the most disturbing scenes, but are so well done.

I knew nothing about Jeffrey Dahmer before this show and I honestly despise him for the stuff he has done. I have literally closed my laptop during certain scenes.

Would definitely recommend as both the plot and characters are brilliant.

That theme as well. Chilling 😬

7.5/10."
10.0,23 September 2022,"I am an Englishman and was born after his crimes. I have a fascination with this sort of thing, yet the killer is normally romanticized or you feel some form of sympathy for him.

This show just shows the deterioration of a person. That word is probably wrong, as his father was willing to admit he was an odd child, and did weird things, and a fathers prerogative was to protect his child. This show shows the descent (and odd lucid groundhog moments). Basically this show shows the reality as we know it today (from dahmer and others testimony).

It doesn't sugar coat or downplay it, just shows the true morbid nature of Dahmer.

(Typing this during the silent deaf scene (paused, I'm not that rude!) And just thought that even though I'm not a big ""whodunnit"" fan, or normal murder type shows, this was so good, and true)

Enjoy x."
10.0,13 October 2022,"With ""American Horror Story"", Ryan Murphy looked at the human capacity for evil. With ""American Crime Story"", Murphy looked at assorted bad things that have happened in the US in recent decades. His new miniseries ""Dahmer"" could get called a combination of these. The main story is of course about Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters) and his hideous deeds. But another facet of the story is how Dahmer's neighbor Glenda Cleveland (Niecy Nash) tried to warn people that something ugly was afoot in his apartment, but her warnings fell on deaf ears. Not to mention that many of the victims were black and gay in an era when AIDS was already ravaging those communities.

I understand that the series has drawn accusations of being exploitative, and that some of the victims' family members refuse to watch it. Maybe so, but I found it haunting just to see what Dahmer did. I recommend it if you're willing to see some of these truly grotesque things, and to understand how the authorities refused to acknowledge the warnings.

The rest of the cast includes Richard Jenkins (Nate Sr. On ""Six Feet Under""), Molly Ringwald, Michael Learned and Penelope Ann Miller."
9.0,1 October 2022,Binge watched it in one day i like how they came back and forth from past to future to show how the killer came about his crimes i cried so much during the last episodes i can't imagine what it must've been like to the victim's families they will always be remembered. Evan peters has absolutely killed this role in every way possible he showed eerely similar expressions to the real jeffree not to mention the actor who played tony and in that scene where he came back to the killer's house and he had the hammer behind his back???? I was screaming for it not end up the way it did how can someone be so cruel at last my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families they had their whole life ahead of them it's absolutely devastating.
10.0,16 October 2024,"For some reason I thought this just came out.... The reality is this show is good but suffers from the same flaws almost all of Murphy's work suffers from. It's overly sexualized and erotic and cheapens everything around it. At times it doesn't know when to take itself seriously.

The performances and overall story was great... The actors who play the boys are fantastic.... I learned so much about this case and I admit I burned through the series in a few days... Wit that that said, I still think the OJ Simpson trial was a much better series. However, Sevegny and Bardem really shine and this series has its merits if you're looking for something to burn through."
6.0,29 September 2024,"Let me explain. Ryan has now gone on record stating that he never contacted the Menendez brothers before, during, or after production. The victims' families from the Dahmer case have also said that no one contacted them. Some families even said that they didn't know about it until the show came out and they had to relive the trauma of losing their loved one.

These shows are gross misrepresentations of real events that hurt real people. Ryan doesn't care about exposing these stories. He doesn't care about the victims. Ryan only cares about profit, and right now, living off of victims' trauma is his cash cow. It's disgusting and I urge everyone to avoid this man's work and this show."
10.0,24 September 2022,"This ten-episode series tells the story of Jeffrey Dahmer. A horrible and shocking story that will probably not only leave you disgusted by the nature of the crimes, but also by a complete lack of professionalism by the local police at the time.

While the story unfolds I did some research on Dahmer and found this series to stay very true to actual events. It's very wel made in every aspect of cinematographic art. Camerawork, acting, scenario and dialogues are above and beyond average. The story sticks.

The quality of this series is not only in depicting Dahmers life and crimes in a truthful way. It places all of the events in the context of that time, which adds to the uncomfortable truth that Dahmer could go on for so long. We see racism within the police force, the beginning and advance of AIDS, a strong religious culture with all of its taboos and 'things not spoken about'. We're also confronted with a sich phenomenon that still exists today: people in full an sick admiration of Dahmer, asking for his autograph and sending him money. Companies that build on the gruesome deeds by publishing comic books on the story. A police force with a culture that makes change hard, if not impossible.

The series not only shows the story of a very sick man, but also of a (partially) sick society. It's not for the faint of heart, but definitely a series I'd recommend for all of the above reasons."
7.0,23 September 2022,"Niecy Nash did an amazing job! She deserves every award possible for her performance in this limited series. She did Glenda Cleveland proud by getting her story out there and letting people know how she Ms. Cleveland stood up.

Evan sure can play a psycho.

If you think you know the story you do not unless you wrote a thesis on the serial killer's victims or it. This is very informative and you are going to learn a lot.

I wish they had put even more light on his victims so everyone knows their names: Steven Mark Hicks Steven Walter Tuomi James Edward Doxtator Richard Guerrero Anthony Lee Sears Raymond Lamont Smith Edward Warren Smith Ernest Marquez Miller David Courtney Thomas Curtis Durrell Straughter Errol Lindsey Tony Anthony Hughes Konerak Sinthasomphone Matt Cleveland Turner Jeremiah Benjamin Weinberger Oliver Joseph Lacy Joseph Arthur Bradehoft

His survivor's names! All his victim's family members and friends and community members."
10.0,26 September 2022,"To make it short: this isn't a show about a very sick being. This is a document of a very sick society full of racism, neglect, white privilege and a police structure that is self-righteous without being controlled.

It makes you physically sick. But not watching bones in acid and blood stained beds. It's the injustice, suppression of black and brown and whatever coloured people other than white and inequality that runs deep in the veins of the US. The true horror is that system that let Dahmer keep going. A system that rules white over black and brown. A system that is far from being a thing that happened in the past. It couldn't be more ""now"".

This is letting you freeze up.

Watch it."
7.0,29 September 2022,"I don't remember being so scared in so long, despite all horror movies in catalog and I've seen over the years. Peter Evans makes you feel a little bit of the tension victims may have felt, you feel trapped, hopeless and helpless, anger, sorrow, despair, terror are some of the things you will experience, you can feel it in the flesh, you can taste fear you can picture yourself as one of Dahmer's prey. The writing is so good, you can actually hear what they actually where saying at the time, and it makes you feel you are seeing something you should not be seeing. Cast performances are glorious, Evans will make you feel pity but most of all, will make you hate him."
1.0,1 November 2022,"It starts so good, with great perfomances. The cast is such amazing. But the two last episodes... Well, all of the religious stuff, the neighbour's story and the religious prisoner are so uninteresting. It would be a 10 if they finished the serie at episode 7 (with all of the last episodes in one). Also they could pick up a younger actor for Dahmer sr. But Richard Jenkins is a great actor and I forgive him everything. (His mother in the series could be his sister)

Evan Peters makes a great job, giving mistery, psycopathical looks and movements, bjt the same as the beggining: all of the religious message is vert superfluous."
8.0,24 September 2022,"I love shows about serial killers and I also love Evan Peters as an actor which made this show a must try for me. This mini series is largely a horror show, with more focus on Jeffrey Dahmer in the act than the aftermath of what he has done. It has a historical aspect to it as well, but those are not super present until the last three episodes or so.

The acting is phenomenal - especially from Dahmer's dad, the pacing is great but occasionally slow, and the actual meat of the show (no pun intended) is solid almost every time. If you need something to scratch your Mindhunter itch, this is your show."
9.0,30 September 2022,"Man this series is a bit of a shame since this is the best looking Ryan Murphy production to date. Best written too though that's not saying much, this show still has its rough points. And I mean rough. The obvious one is the flashback childhood scenes of Dahmer which include terrible child actors and really awful dialogue from the younger versions of his parents. There's also the moral quandary some people have with this show which I definitely felt at some points. There just seemed to be some stylistic elements that maybe glorified or put Dahmer in a better or more sympathetic tone than maybe the directors wanted to convey which came off real uncomfortable. Also the fact that the victims families aren't receiving more compensation from the series yet it mentions Lionel Dahmer's troubles with his book, it's just hypocritical. Also it's too long. There. Everything else is either fine or good. The acting for the most part from the adults is well done and they even deliver some poor lines in a way that felt more natural. The series looks great. The greater focus it had on the victims and their families was a good inclusion though they are totally lying when they mention that this show isn't from Jeffrey Dahmer's point of view. That's only true for maybe three episodes. And of course the sixth episode is great and I feel like it deserves all the praise it's been getting. Pretty conflicted on this one but I was compelled to watch it all so there's obviously something to it."
10.0,26 September 2022,"Literally. Echo others' comments. It truly is produced outstandingly.

It is very much disturbing though, not for the faint of heart. I mean it. The storyline is damn disturbing. Maybe its me, but it did have a depressing effect on me, to learn about such incidences. Totally production worthy material and treated justice to, in productizing into a well made binge worthy series.

Hats off to the characterization and performance, esp dahmer's. It is hard to characterize such a devil as a human and holy God, it is just heck of a performance.

Binge watch material for sure. I remained on the edge of the seat, in horror. Take a bow, Netflix."
10.0,7 October 2022,"This show has gotten a lot of controversy, and none of us can know how we'd feel if we were members of victim's families. So I don't blame them for being upset.

I have to admit I expected it to be more graphic. I'm glad it wasn't and a lot of the acts were depicted off screen.

I watch a lot of true crime documentaries and fictional 'based on true crime' shows and this one is one of the better ones. Evan peters does such an incredible job at encompassing Dahmer - his mannerisms, voice, creepiness, intelligence. Such a great actor.

The rest of the acting is also really well done. The actors playing Glenda, Lionel and Toby especially.

There were some moments where it got a bit slow, and I think it could have been cut down to 8 episodes instead of 10. But all in all it was well done and an interesting watch."
9.0,21 September 2024,"Would've liked to watch something unbiased. To make dahmer look glorified but to show these boys as completely twisted is heartbreaking. Not enough time spent looking at what they went through that pushed them to that decision. Quite disappointing considering it could affect the mistrial. It feels lousy. The acting is brilliant and can clearly put emotion across, however it's so disappointing to portray the characters in the way the director has chosen to do so. If you watch and have no idea about the boys past, I encourage researching it yourself as this show is an inaccurate representation of what actually went on."
7.0,25 September 2022,".....celebrates white male serial while disrespecting the families of their victims.

The ten stars were just for exposure; I'd give this three stars. While occasionally achieving a respect tone, RM is unable to hold on to those treads and maintain a point of view. Regardless of how much RM says he honoring victimes and shining a light on their stories; it's not his story to tell especially without the consulting The victims.

He doesn't have the talent, character, or willingness to craft the story he pretends he wants to tell. The redeeming parts of show aren't because of RM. I suspect there's a thoughtful show in here, but RMs hand in the project stifles it.

Niecy Nash is amazing! I'd edit out all of the gratuitous Dalmar scenes, and make the whole show follow her story."
10.0,23 September 2022,"Awesome series!

Brilliant actor (Evan Peters).

I already knew the story, but was completely dumbfound about the police officers negligent behavior.

The series brought a completely different light upon the tragedy surrounding Dahmer. It makes us aware that police forces really neglected non-white people.

It makes you think. At the beginning you might want to strangle Dhamer. At the end you might want to strangle people arround him.

I wonder if the threatening calls to a victims' father were really made by... whom the series indicated.

At the end, you lean back and wonder: Who's the real monster in this?"
5.0,24 September 2022,"Niecy gives a stunning portrayal of a woman who suffered by hearing and watching the vindictive things Jeffery did. No one wanted to listen to her and Nash captures the essence of a woman who could have stopped more murders from occurring. Evan Peters dives deep into the role of a sadistic spineless killer. Peter's performance shines throughout every scene. Although the series is well thought out, these events did occurred and how the Milwaukee Police failed to save so many lives. The lives of innocent black and brown men, the victims and their families still need to be respected. Remember them."
10.0,15 October 2022,"The actor's appearance was spot on correct. First episode was the toughest for me as I came to realisation that this was all real and had happened to many people. Further venturing into how this affected many families lives.

It told the story well, without focusing too much on showing the kills. It gave a better understanding, psychologically, of how someone could be so mental.

This does contain a lot of violence, all of the reviews based on users votes are correct too.

This can be quite emotional if you get quite stressed over these types of films/ series.

The main actor, who plays Jeffrey, has performed this role amazing. Especially considering this must have been very difficult to film and to come to realisation over a man with such crime."
8.0,14 October 2024,"I think it's worth noting that despite how you feel about the show cinematically, it's inaccurate. There can never be an accuracy in a story that has no adage from the people involved in it. Whether or not you believe that Lyle and Erik actually murdered their parents is beside the point. The actual story leaves much to be desired. While there were some very humorous moments throughout the show that really resonated with me, and while it was very emotional, it left a bit to be desired historically. I believe that the characters were definitely portrayed as one dimensional, which can be a problem when dealing with real people and a case that can be opened again in real time. It's important while watching this show to enjoy it for what it is rather than what it could be, and I believe that my rating would be higher had I not viewed it in this light. If you're watching it because you enjoy Ryan Murphy, then there are much better shows on the market. Overall, I give it a six because the ending felt weak and so did the characters. The actors of themselves were well, and if you're looking for a good performance, this is it, but if you're someone like me who can't really get past the actual idiot nature of a show that you're watching, this is not for you."
10.0,4 October 2022,"Ever since I was a little girl I used to read all about those serial killers and Dahmer really stood out to me .. he was different more interesting and when I saw that Netflix was doing a whole series about him staring Evan f Peters I was so excited! Let me tell you it didn't disappoint!! It was very detailed and accurate, quite disturbing and so enjoyable to watch! I fall in love with Evan Peter's acting once again!!! Brilliant, Outstanding, Unique and absolutely perfect. I have already recommended it to a few people and I highly recommend it to you too! It's so worth to watch if not for the cinematography then for the information it was absolutely outstanding! And as a true cinema fan and fellow creator I may say that it was brilliantly directed, shot; the costumes were absolutely brilliant and authentic, the decor- Jeff's apartment, his house, everything was so well made! BRAVOOOO to the whole team of ""DAHMER"" !!!"
8.0,27 September 2024,"Part of Netflix's true crime anthology series, presents a fascinating premise but struggles to maintain engagement throughout its episodes. The series begins with a strong first episode, setting up the complex dynamics of the Menendez family and the infamous murder case. However, the pacing quickly falters. As with many Netflix productions, the show is well-produced, but it is bogged down by overly long dialogues and scenes that drag on for far too long. These extended moments sap the tension, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. Instead of gripping storytelling, much of the series feels like a slow crawl, where the viewer's interest is repeatedly tested. While the performances are solid and the story itself is compelling, the execution leaves much to be desired. The show lacks that extra element of suspense or tightness that could elevate it from good to great. By the end, one might feel like they could have experienced the same depth from reading a well-written book. It's a decent watch, but not a standout in the true crime genre."
8.0,4 October 2022,"Great limited series with a stand out performance from Evan Peters,,dark disturbing and utterly addictive.from the first few frames this show sucks you into Dahmer's world,, episode 1 could have been a movie on it's own it's that good,,it moves along at a steady pace giving certain victims their own episodes,,the families of the victims perspective is shown with real compassion and never glorifies what happened to them, sometimes the sounds are enough .Dahmer's own family story isn't straight forward but his father gives a top performance,,,great writing and cinematography with a really good soundtrack make this one of the best shows Netflix has released,in fact I believe it's their best show to date."
10.0,15 October 2022,
10.0,20 September 2024,"I just want to point out how heinously unethical, vicious and cruel this show was, especially in its timing. The Menendez Brothers' case is actively being appealed as we speak, and the infamous nature of their case means that public perception is important.

By the time of their trial in 1993, the media had already fully assassinated their characters, assigned them motives and personalities based on limited and incomplete information, and made it almost impossible to select a jury of people who had never heard of this version of the case before. After a lengthy trial that ended in a hung jury where 50+ witnesses testified about the severe abuse they had both suffered, and even some of the public had come to be on their side, two TV movies ""A Killing in Beverly Hills' and ""Honor thy Father and thy Mother"" were released rife with inaccuracies, lies and omissions of key facts, along with the caricatured portrayals of them as spoiled greedy sociopaths. Many of these claims were easily debunked at the trial but of course, nobody cared. And so yet again, while they were awaiting a second trial and selecting a jury, their hopes of having an unbiased public and jury were thwarted.

And now, after almost 35 years, when the public discourse about this case had just started to shift to empathy, acknowledgement and understanding of the abuse they had suffered and after having filed an appeal in 2023, Ryan Murphy decides to release this intentionally false and cruel fictionalization of their lives to an international audience. Whatever anyone says or does, it can never undo the images, ideas and inaccuracies Ryan Murphy and his team have cemented into the minds of those who watched this.

My question is why? Why make this? What was the need? To further demonize and punish two men who are living out sentences of life without possibility of parole? You really needed to twist the knife?

Hiding behind artistic liberty is not enough to justify the unconscionable lies promoted in this show. Inaccuracy and carelessness to this level are not okay when the people affected are alive and are currently appealing their case in the legal system."
10.0,23 October 2022,"Netflix did a great job letting us into a serial killer's mind and i cant think of anyone other than Evan Peters to play Dahmer, there were times i could relate to the killer and there were times i was repulsed by him; it proves that Evan Peters was really good at his job. I love that they didnt pick sides (except for the times when the other side was black), they just told the story from an observer's perspective; they didnt try too hard to make us hate this character. I respect that.

I couldnt help but check graphic images related to this case while i was watching these series. I've had pictures of these victims in the next tab, pictures of his apartment and of course the polaroid pics and I must say Netflix made the most realistic adaptation ever! His actual apartment looked exactly the same, I couldnt tell apart his actual father from the actor.

There were times they changed the script to make things more dramatic though. Like the way Dahmer murdered Tony and the way he tried to make him a zombie by drilling his skull.

The only character that seemed too much was Glenda. This character was too extra when you consider that the actual Glenda let alone being neighbors with him and getting offered sandwiches from him, didnt even know Dahmer personally. They wanted to give moral lessons through this character, they wanted to show us the unseen minorities i know. But there were times when the Black investigator and Glenda seemed very unnatural, cartonized and victimized.

Its like Netflix made the best soup ever but when it was time to serve it, they were reminded to ""spice it up"" with moral lessons and ended up making the soup too salty. My point is that the moral lessons were so out of the place that it seemed unnatural and it was like they added these extra lines later because whenever the black investigator made a remark in regards of minorities, there was an awkward silence and no response at all. I didnt like the atmosphere they tried to create there.

I know there was police ignorance and most of the times Dahmer could get away with murder just because he was a white blonde male and his victims were people of color. There were injustice. But cartonizing characters in order to make your point is never a good idea because by the end of the series I couldnt help but feel like i was watching a poorly made propaganda."
10.0,8 October 2022,"This series triggers many emotions in a person. From horror to sadness. This is due to the built atmosphere of the series. After watching, a person asks himself many questions, whether a person is born evil or acquires evil from the environment. What pushed Dahmer to commit these crimes? Are genes to blame, drugs taken by his mother during pregnancy, operations on dead animals shown by his father, or just simple neglect of his son? I think a little bit of everything. I also think that people are not born evil, but certain people are more prone to this evil because of their genes, for example. The surgeries shown by the father or the neglect of the son may have only perpetuated his ""inner desires"" and strengthened him in this. Of course, this is just my opinion, this topic is so vast and confusing that it is hard to come to a unanimous consensus. The police in this series have been swept up in the mud, and if it's all true, I can't imagine how many such beasts lived to old age later because of the ""broken"" police. And as for the father I continue to have mixed feelings, supposedly trying to help his son as much as possible, and on the other hand trying to make money by writing a book (saying, of course, that it's all for future parents). As for the construction of the series itself, it is done very well, the music perfectly matched. It is not as disgusting as it could be, many of the murder scenes were not shown as well as all the quartering scenes thanks to this it activates the imagination and shows that it is not a typical horror film that is supposed to be disgusting just a film that is supposed to make you think. 9/10 is my final rating for this series, I recommend everyone to watch it."
10.0,5 October 2022,"It is really horrific to see what those 17 souls and their friends & families have to go through. No words can heal their suffering but this review is purely for the cinematic grounds which is direction, screenplay and acting

Superb acting by Evan Peters. The way Netflix has managed this is absolutely brilliant.

You will actually feel Evan Peters is psycho. Brilliantly played. The plot and screenplay is flawlessly executed and you may not find even single instance where something disconnected or not making sense.

Every time frame and the look and feel of that time feels like it is shot in 70s and 80s. Perfect!!

Hard to avoid binge watching this."
10.0,8 October 2022,"No series left me with as many feelings as Monster-Story of Jeffrey Dahmer. From the first episode, the series brilliantly alternates crime/thriller/horror genres, only to spill over into a psychological drama in the second half. And a really strong drama. This is most visible in the episode with Tony, which is deliberately shot from the victim's point of view. Only a few films manage to evoke so many emotions......the series only managed to do it once ( finale + Eddie Stranger Things........a purely subjective thing). In addition, the acting is excellent. Especially Evan Peters in the role of Dahmer. I wouldn't be afraid to call this miniseries the best thriller series with Mindhunter. 100%"
10.0,28 October 2022,"When this series was announced, I was super excited for it to come out. However, I was also cautious and went into it prepared for disappointment.

Where do I start? I was not let down by this series, in fact, it might be my favourite show of the last few years.

Evan Peters' performance in Dahmer is absolutely incredible, he's played bad and terrifying people before this, but this role takes the cake.

I really appreciated that Dahmer's action were not necessarily glorified, and that we also learned about his victim's lives.

The victims were not just there to be killed by Dahmer, they mean so much more in this portrayal of Dahmer's dreadful story.

The aesthetic and atmosphere were amazing, Ryan Murphy has really outdone himself with this one!

A good watch for all true crime fans, the series is very detailed and in line with reality."
3.0,23 October 2022,"The series could be called really cool and deserving of recognition, if it did not have such a broken story in terms of dynamics and moments when the authors inadvertently or purposely begin to make a martyr out of him, who should not be overtaken by such a sad fate. This is too low and of course this cruel killer should not be whitewashed.

I have no questions about Peters at all, he brilliantly played those moments when the authors failed, he carried everything on himself. Overall, the cast performed at a high level, even in those scenes that were either unnecessary or downright weak.

It cannot be called a masterpiece. This is a solid series about the life of a real beast, but it is impossible to rate it higher than 7 points."
10.0,26 September 2022,"I loved everything about this series. The suspense is beyond expectations. The actor did a very good job in representing the real dahmer we know. In short, it a must watch series that was produced to last.

I liked the focus on the mind of Dahmer. His motives, emotions and most importantly his childhood. We were taken in a journey to discover his true self. Starting with murders and then delving deep down into the darkness. I think the show made us understand Dahmer in a brilliant way.

After the disappointment of high budget series in 2022, here Dahmer comes to compensate.

I recommend watching it."
10.0,3 November 2022,"This is a harrowing real-life dramatization, and Evan Peters does an amazing acting job in portraying Dahmer. But the series is way too long, with a lot of repetition of Dahmer's modus operandi that seems superfluous to telling the story. We get he was a monster. A series of 4 to 5 episodes would have sufficed, the rest is just padding and lowers the overall quality. As is usual with these things, the Police get a sound kicking, and with hindsight (such a wonderful thing) should have done more. But much of the time Dahmer was working in the (then) twilight world gay bars, recreational drugs. Not easy to police."
10.0,6 November 2022,"A friend of mine recommended the series and I liked it very much, and when I watched the first episode, the series was immediately impressive.

I don't know what happened to the person named Dahmer at the time, but the child's psychology was really bad.

An event that affects people deeply, no one wants to encounter such an event.

The series was very successful, the actors were designed very well, as if the same people were playing in the series, they were very similar.

But what they did is so terrible, it really deserves the name monster I'm sure the real dahmer is burning in hell but when you look at it, it was a very successful series, good luck to everyone."
10.0,30 September 2022,"I've been reading a lot of comments online saying that this story needs to be put to rest, and while I largely believe that to be true, I believe this particular telling of the story was completely necessary.

Every time I hear of Dahmer's story being told in a podcast, documentary, movie, etc. I find it infuriating that they always focus on the grisly, gory details and erase everything else about race and the larger systemic issues.

But finally, the parts that were historically erased are amplified. The victims finally get to be full human beings, their families pain gets to be acknowledged, Glenda Cleveland gets a spotlight. The morbidly indulgent fans who glorified dahmer are finally getting shamed. And who knows, hopefully the series will re-spark public outcry against the Milwaukee PD since officers John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish have never been held accountable for what they did.

This series is necessary because America needs to see it through a new lens: this time with actual compassion, heartbreak, anger, and accountability.

But now that everything that needed to be said has been said, I hope this story can finally be put to rest.

Kudos to the writers and the creators for their thought, care and respect in this telling."
10.0,29 September 2022,"Gripping, shocking, and a real eye opener to human behaviour in the extreme. It pulls you into a captivating, yet disturbing account of Dahmer's thoughts, beliefs and behaviour. It brings to light the long history of cultural racism, social discrimination and professional incompetence. This really is a compelling insight into human insanity playing out in society.

It also reveals the hardness of the human heart, a lack of forgiveness towards one another and a relentless desire for punishment when we are in pain.

Evan Peters displays an outstanding performance that will remain with me for some time. Truely excellent, a must watch."
10.0,10 November 2022,"What makes the series so good is that almost everything that happens in the series is true, 1 of the things that is not true is neighbor is 2 people in 1 character and they have chosen the perfect actors because they look so much like the people they play. The creators did not romanticize a psychopath like most series, but mainly focused on why he did it and its consequences. The emotion and the acting is just perfect. There really isn't much negative to say about it, just that the events of the last 2 episode are mostly fiction to fill up the ending a bit. For the people who do NOT like to see blood, this is recommended because you don't see the horrific murders happen, you hear it or they say the details."

9.0,24 September 2022,"Wow. Top notch acting. A rare look into the ""humanization"" of a monster, antagonized by his very detailed actions. Yes it's gruesome and creepy and shocking yet not gory. The kill/dismemberment/sexual scenes were very well filmed and directed to ignite the horror without turning into a halloween sharade.

So much psychology in this. So much parallelism that shows what it meant to deal with the police in WI at the time if you were white vs if you were black. Every actor in this series deserves an award.

Leaves a mark, makes you think. Something neftlix has failed to do so far with its horrible fill-time latest series. I hope everything they produce from now on is at this standard !"
10.0,24 September 2022,I'm honestly not big into true crime anymore. A lot of it has always been interesting for me though but this show takes the CAKE. Episode 1 was terrifying cause you know the story already and what's going to happen. You're on the edge of your seat the entire time. I've watched so mant documentaries and shows on Jeffrey Dahmer but I believe that this really does bring justice to the victims and their families. It even dives into Jeffery's family and how it impacted them. I recommend this show to whoever is interested in True Crime or just needing something to watch. So interesting! This show a WATCH!
8.0,26 September 2022,"This was so beautifully written, directed and casted at top level. The cast is great and acting is all time high. But, Evan Peters is a true genius of is portrayal. This guy has always been a great actor but this has to be his all time best. Evan Peters deserves an award here! There was times I forgot I was watching acting and it was like he became dauhmer. The way they show the victims and give them a place and heart really spoke volumes. The writers made them part of the story which many crime shows/movies do not do. The way this is written makes you truly care and feel for all involved. Ryan Murphy never disappoints."
8.0,25 September 2022,"Difficult to watch, but brilliant acting, writing and directing. Evan Peters has just got better and better as an actor and my god you've got to be brave to take on a role like this. I wouldn't wanna do it. The writing and directing just great as well. It tells the story of Dahmer without making the audience feel sorry for him, that's not the point. It's to show the journey of a truly evil sadistic man. Blood curdling to say the least. I wish it were fiction, as I feel bad for leaving a 10 star review for content so deeply upsetting for the families of those who were murdered. I'll pretend it's fiction for my own sanity and say bravo to those involved."
10.0,24 September 2024,"Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan always create a masterpiece. I have deep appreciation for the way Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan explore dark themes in their series, particularly in ""Monster."" Round of applause to all the actors and actress of this series. Their ability to delve into the psychology of killers creates a captivating and chilling experience. The blend of thrill, fear, and understanding of the mind of a predator certainly leaves a lasting impact, making the series memorable-even haunting. It's interesting how horror can evoke such strong emotions and provoke thought, even leading to nightmares, yet I find that aspect enjoyable. The complexity of these narratives really resonates with viewers who are fascinated by true crime and psychological depth. Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan consistently create that captivate and challenge audiences, especially evident in their series of Jeffrey Dahmer: The amazing actor Even Peter's and all the supporting actress and actors."" Their exploration of dark themes, especially the psychology of killers, offers a chilling yet fascinating experience. By delving into the minds of predators, they craft narratives that blend thrill and fear with profound psychological insight. This complexity resonates deeply with viewers drawn to true crime and the intricacies of human behavior. The haunting nature of their storytelling evokes strong emotions, provoking thought and even nightmares, yet this aspect becomes a source of enjoyment. Their artful approach transforms horror into a compelling exploration of the human psyche. I would love for these directors to work again-to create a series of a serial killers Richard Ramirez and John Wayne Gacy and even more."
1.0,1 October 2022,"This show has genouisly captured the terror of those times. The way the director has played with the timelines to capture every little detail of Dahmer's acts is marvelous. The acting was godly - both from Evan Peters and from all those incredible actors who managed to merge with the role and show the actual horror all those families have been through. The other incredible thing is that these series aren't only for showing Dahmer's side from the story, but the society's views, too - the unprofessional work of the police and the major discrimination, homophobia and the racism all those victims and their families had to endure, the disbelief that this has happened and the many times he has slipped away only because he is white. This managed to enrage all the viweres, and this is an indication that the series and the actors have played pretty well. Also, the similarity of both the actors, and the apartment are so lookalike, that it's pretty chilling. As a true crime fan, I expected this show to be pretty badly made since all such productions for real life events are, but I was left utterly surprised at how good in every aspect it was. Marvelous work of both directors and actors!"
8.0,24 September 2022,"Started off pretty good, then in Neflix fashion they decided to bend it to fit current sociopolitical issues around racism. Dalmer killed all different races including white men. In his interviews (check on youtube) he even states race was not a factor he was just picking up whoever he could. Netflix continuing to try and stir up the anti white sentiment. Multiple times in the show they try to bring up race issues. It does also get pretty slow inc too much filler and jumps about way too much.

The acting is quite good, although maybe a bit monotone. I don't believe he was as introverted and solitary as the show makes out."
10.0,27 September 2022,
10.0,23 September 2022,"At a running time of nearly nine hours, many might wonder why it takes this series nearly 7 hours more than most other films or documentaries on the same topic to capture the life and events of Jeffrey Dahmer...

The answer is because this series offers a rich panorama of both the psychopath's journey as well as all of the psychological horror he inflicts on all of the lives in the crossfire. His apartment neighbor, his father, his grandmother, his victims, and his victims' families.

The tragic series is surprisingly detailed and stays as close to the story as possible. The narrative moves around on several timelines through periods of his life in an unpredictable order. This seems to me to have been done for pacing rather than providing back stories. Though it moves in a more linear timeline in the last few episodes.

What this series does better than most is breathe life and humanity into the victims--mostly through the life of Tony, a young deaf, aspiring black model with a big heart from an incredibly loving family. It may bring you to tears when that episode wraps up. It is just devastating.

All of the acting is sublime. You feel for nearly every character on screen at times, even the monster himself. Standouts to me are Evan Peters, Niecy Nash and Richard Jenkins, as they had the most screen time, but it was well acted throughout.

TL;DR give it a watch, especially if you've seen other Dahmer movies... This one is something special."
8.0,23 September 2022,"Oh I am speechless. This is the best Dahmer filming creation ever!!! I highly recommend it.

Every single scene is gorgeously done. From music and outfits to bloody scenes and cars. Pure perfection . It also covers other perspectives and peoples views on the whole situation. I also love how we learn the aftermath, parents background, locations, victims lives.. You really get it this time. It's not like watching YouTube documentary where you learn nothing new. This is an eye opener and horrifically realistic. And the actors omg actors are incredible. Leading man deserves an oscar! And producers and directors deserve one too!!

Watch it!!"
10.0,23 September 2022,"This show makes you hate and love and loath and feel sorry for one of the most brutal serial killers ever. Evan Peters is fantastic, makes you wanna hug him and and punch him and run away from him at the same time.

And all the other actors are great too, especially Richard Jenkins playing Dahmer's dad.

Besides this monster's drama the show focuses on social problems as well, especially on the fact that the police could not care less that young men of color were tortured or killed. Dahmer got away with his terrible actions several times just because he was white and articulate. Yet, the show is not trying to pray, it just shows everyting in a matter of fact way.

The atmosphere is so strong at some points it felt like I was watching Seven. Great show!"
10.0,26 September 2024,"Both seasons have the same unique feel and tone that stands out from other recent shows.

""Monsters"" stands out among modern shows with its gripping portrayal of intense characters and the haunting atmosphere of its time period. Unlike many contemporary series that rely heavily on effects or trends, ""Monsters"" brings depth through nuanced performances and a tension that builds naturally from its richly detailed setting. The show immerses viewers in the characters' struggles, making every moment feel urgent and raw. Its masterful pacing and dark tone make it not just a show, but an experience that surpasses many of its genre counterparts today."
3.0,23 September 2022,"Out of all the serial killer movies and documentaries, I have watched, & that number is quite high, this is the single one, that literally terrifies me, and I think that's primarily, because for once, this focus's on the victims, and in no way is glorifying the killer. This series, is definitely hard to watch at times, and I have had to look away, cringing, but this side of the serial killer story, needed to be done, and Netflix has done a brilliant job at doing it! The series is seriously creepy, chilling, shocking, and all too real, which for me, makes it one of the best representations that has ever been created on this subject! Bravo Netflix, and thank you for sharing the victims side...."
10.0,3 November 2022,"A very unfortunate serie, with no purpose to be, no values, not a tribute for the victims but the exploitation of cruelty and human suffering The series goes into gruesome details of the crimes committed, with no shame nor respect for the victims and surviving relatives The acting as good as it might be, the production and directing are inglesa when there is no lesson, but just a point of perpetuating hatred and injustice There is no depth to the characters, just anecdotes that do a poor job of explaining their motives, and actions.

There is no reason to glorify a criminal, bring back a dark moment in time that had a ripple effect on a community and country Ryan Murphy and his cast are very talented and gifted artists, they took an unnecessary risk for the sake of controversy, without stepping back for a minute and reflecting on the live victims. Not every subject matter has to be developed for the sake of entertainment, or unhealthy fascination with the macabre.

There is a lack of respect for the viewer, the ones who suffered and the killer's family. The producers, actors and director have the amazing opportunity to communicate, the responsibility to create with higher standards, transmit values, hope and the better of humans, instead of nothingness, existential voids, and people without any redemption quality."
9.0,5 October 2022,"Over a cold and chilly weekend, I binged watched the whole series and it was riveting!!

A brilliantly acted performance by Evan Peters. It was such a creepy and dangerously believable role. The transformation was amazing to see 'Dahmer' develop in each episode and get bolder.

I had heard of Jeffrey Dahmer but didn't really understand the whole story. From the perspective of the victims and the incompetence of the police and judge(s) it was a very shocking experience and a very hard watch.

I would highly recommend watching this series - not to glorify Dahmer who in my view was insane to say the least but to give justice to each and every victim who were robbed of a life and not given the justice they deserve. Most of these men would have been alive today if Dahmer had been stopped earlier, very much earlier. Shame on the justice system for failing each and every one of these men."
9.0,23 September 2022,"Ryan Murphy brings the story of Dahmer alive from every angle.

From probable causes for his behaviour and the institutional racism and homophobia that allowed him to get away with the murders as long as he did.

Also it does not glamorise Dahmer as some have done with similar stories of serial killers.

This is a thorough look into both the man and the heinous acts he committed.

If you love true crime this is for you.

Evan Peters does a frighteningly good job as Dahmer. Plus the proven creative relationship between Murphy and Peters only strengthens after this master class of story telling.

This is a must see and I would be shocked if it didn't gain a few accolades along the way."
9.0,31 October 2022,"This story gave me chiils!

I thought that Netflix again released only about LGBT or something. Yes, but only about gomosexuality of Jeffrey Dahmer. Thats all!

Evan Peters was amazing! He made his job very good! For this-BIGGEST RESPECT! Jeffrey Dahmer was very. Evan Peters played his character like it was the real Jeffrey, I think he got to know his character (read the background and memoirs of everyone who was close to Dahmer) before playing him. The series is worth watching at least once in a lifetime, because I have not found such a plausible series (along with the HBO series ""Chernobyl"")."
8.0,25 September 2022,"As far as I've seen, this is the most detailed and honest of any Dahmer movie/series to-date. Great acting, too. Nash shines like one of the most brilliant of actors, and Peters is deserving as well. I hope Nash receives the recognition that she she damn well deserves for her portrayal of Dahmers' neighbor, who withstood an immense amount of ptsd causing distress, due to the ever neglectful eye of the police -especially in the late eighties and further. Wins and wins for both of these incredibly talented actors. Both are often overlooked, especially Nash. Give Nash an award for this! Please give Mash the award she deserves for her portrayal of Ms Cleveland!!"
10.0,23 September 2022,"This felt like a combination between American Horror Story and American Crime Story. It was mostly done very well and managed to keep you interested through majority of it.

Evan Peters is an amazing actor as always and he managed to carry this very well. I always felt like he (the actor) deserves more recogniation than he gets, and I'm glad he is starting to get more of it now. Nothing but good words to him.

While watching, I felt like the show did a good work showing you the victims side of it and giving them the respect that they deserve. Unlike most shows that maybe end up glorifying the killers by putting all of the focus on them, this one really attempts not to (though it doesn't always succeed because Evan himself is naturally likeable). They really try to make you feel for the victims and their families and how wrong they were treated, not just by the killer himself but also by everyone around them. It clearly criticizes the racism and the dismissive attitude by the authorities, both before and after the killer was caught. It also made sure to show you what happens after the killer was caught, how the story of trauma doesn't end there and people can't just move on with their life. And that's the part of reality that is often ignored in the media - the story doesn't just end when the person goes to prison. It's never that easy.

However, after watching it I read that the families of the victims were never updated about this and that it triggered trauma to some of them. Legally the creators of this series did not have to ask for permission or anything, but as the series showed strong critisism towards the people who tried to make profit from the story after it happened without taking the families into consideration, it did feel very weird to learn that this series was made by people who pretty much did the same thing. Even though the series itself is very well made and probably the best non-documentary adaptation of the story, this fact about the families does leave you with some bad aftertaste in retrospect.

Back to the series itself, the only downside of this series in my opinion is that even though it was interesting through most of it, at some point near the end it did feel like it just got EXTREMELY slow, and even became a little boring, kinda like a lot of the content and dialogs were dragged longer on purpose just so they can have 10 episodes. It was a shame to be so engaged in it through most of the series only to get sort of bored of it near the end, kinda underwhelming. I think it would have been much better if they squished things together a little more and kept it to 6-8 episodes total.

For the accuracy level, to my understanding from a quick research the important parts about the crimes were mostly accurate, while fictional changes were usually related to the stories of the neighbors or the police (unclear to what level, but at the very least some parts of those were not accurate)."
9.0,27 September 2022,"The acting, writing, and ability to adapt a real life story off a serial killer into compelling episode after episode is mind blowing. They could have fkd this up hundred different ways, especially being in the horror genre and lose sight of the components that are needed to even have a chance on being next level television. I was drawn in from first 10 minutes and watched it straight through.

There is a lot of junk on TV these days we don't have the luxury of knowing the shows that are worth our time, but this is definitely one of them. Acting was academy award worthy, and to be quite honest the most facsinating part to me was watching this kid grow up in a toxic family environment and how that greatly affects a child's psyche as they grow.

Phenomenal job all around here to the cast, directors, screen writing, and exceptional acting

**MUST WATCH**"
10.0,26 September 2022,"I think it is tasteless and unnecessary to make shows like this about serial killers. The man brutally murdered more than a dozen people, why would you want to make a tv show about that?

A horror movie is one thing because they are works of fiction, I can see how that makes for a thrilling story, but the difference is that this was a real killer with real victims and some of the families are still alive, how do you think they feel when a new tv show comes out about the man who killed someone they love (almost glorifying him) and it becomes the most popular show on Netflix? Have Netflix really sunk that low?

It would be different if it was an informative documentary, something like a collection of interviews with criminal psychologists, police, and victim's family members if they were willing, don't glorify him in any way, but just talk about what he did and try to explain why he did these things, maybe something positive could come out of that because people could learn how these monsters are created and we could all try to make sure that stuff doesn't happen again, but this is just cheap heat, it shocks people (and it should) but that is not automatically a good thing.

If they really wanted to make something like this then they should have made it about Jack the Ripper or other cases like that, because it happened so long ago that everyone involved has been dead for a very long time. So I'm sure this is probably well made as far as tv shows go, but I think it is very tasteless and unnecessary to make a tv show about this creep, and I think it is even sadder that it is currently number 1 on Netflix. People are sick."
8.0,21 September 2022,"Very good story, thrilling, amazing acting, but very slow and quite sometimes, anyway it's one of the best Netflix series, but i think it could be better if it was only five or six episodes.

10.0,4 October 2022,"From episode 1 on it sucks you into its world! Really intense and very creepy! Evan Peters is out of this world in this. The fact that this really happened makes it even more hard.

I really dont write reviews very often but here i needed to. Some people here rate it low because its really difficult to watch and because they portait a sick person here... everyone who worked on this project really well done!!!

If you go and watch the real trial after the show you will understand how much work they put in here to make it as authentic as possible... I ve watched many hard to watch movies or series but this one left me thinking days and nights ..."
10.0,4 October 2022,"This is in many ways an excellent series. It's a biopic of Dahmer, but the makers didn't try to get into his head or point out causes (which could have made for excuses) for his behavior. They evidently wanted to focus on the devastating effect that his crimes had on the families of his victims and on his own family, especially his father. There certainly are some gruesome scenes, but most of the story is pictured in a very slow and cautious way, making the almost clinical way in which Dahmer acts even more sinister and almost unbearable. This is also and very much the merit of Evan Peters, who does an exceptionable job as Jeffrey. But also Richard Jenkins should be mentioned, as the guilt-ridden and desperate, but unrelentingly loyal father Lionel. And Niece Nash as the exasperated neighbor Glenda, who's cries for help were time and again ignored.

In the last episode a judge said something that still lingers in my head: ""we (the victims and their families, the family of Dahmer, the public) have to try and live with the fact that we will never know what went on in the mind of such a serial killer and made him do the things he did"". That's a blood-chilling and very unnerving fact."
4.0,30 November 2022,
9.0,12 October 2022,"I believe two of the hardest roles an actor could possibly play would be a drug addict, or a serial killer. When I knew Evan Peters would be cast as Dahmer I was compelled to watch. Though no doubt disturbing, and in many cases I had to look away, I believe this film is of necessity to our society today, and I had no idea that would be the case.

In the description for the show it hints to answer the question for why he got away with the continuous murders for 10 years. Throughout the film slowly and then all at once the light is shown on the intense racial injustice, racism in general, and the corruption of the police department. It also touches on just how sick our society can be/oblivious to the reality, (or avoidant of the reality) of what is actually happening.

In short, without being phony, overdone, or insensitive to the victims and their families, this mini series really aced an impeccably hard subject to touch on, and more importantly, how to present it. Evan Peters gives an outstanding, attention-grabbing performance, along with the rest of the cast."
9.0,10 November 2022,"I have never been a fan of Netflix content, but this time I must say that ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is an incredible production with a true story that continues to cause controversy. The script based on the already well-known true events of the ""Milwaukee Butcher"" is structured in a non-linear way in most of the episodes, taking us to the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, to the different stages of life of its protagonist and his horrible crimes, plunging us into the question of what led him to do them, perhaps his relationship of abandonment with which he grew up? The emphasis on the lives of its victims and their families are quite well represented and lead you to be part of their suffering, to understand the anger and pain with which they fight/fought, in addition to the fact that social criticism remains the same more 30 years later: the incompetence of the police and their view that ignores still marginalized societies. The cast is well chosen, Evan Peters has made a name for himself playing maniacs, but this time he went much further and portrayed Jeff Dahmer as realistically as possible, Andrew Shaver gives an excellent dramatic performance as Lionel Dahmer and Niecy Nash as Glenda Cleveland demonstrates her great histrionic capacity, deserving to be more recognized her career as an actress, these three actors should definitely appear in the Emmy or Golden Globes nominations next year. It should be noted that it is good to see Molly Ringwald again in a quality production, offering a good performance, it should also be noted the performances of Michael Learned who is a tremendous actress and the actors Shaun J. Brown and Rodney Burford whose professional careers are promising. All the episodes are of tremendous quality, but it is worth noting the suspense used in the first episode, the cloudiness of the fourth and the highly dramatic sixth. Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay and Gregg Araki are three of the directors of the series, each with great careers and who translate their work into their respective episodes that each one directed. The costume design and the setting are the most noticeable, each decade is shown in an impeccable way. The soundtrack is an auditory delight, both the incidental music and the one that accompanies each decade. After all the charms of this series, it should be noted that Jeffrey Dahmer has not been romanticized, a realistic work has been carried out that shows how little society has changed in terms of its judicial system and the prejudices of those who make it up, this tells us it serves to remind us that the most gruesome history is the one that keeps repeating itself."
10.0,4 October 2022,
10.0,28 October 2022,"I feel like this series is not one I can view as a regular tv show. Or give a rating. Cuz it is the history of real victims. I hope this show brings respect to the families who still miss their loved ones today, not fans for the killer. It think it was a good move showing the victims as people, not only that they were murdered because they were more than that. Hope the family can get more retributions that they might not have gotten. My deepest Condolence to the families. I hope there to be a memorial that it seemed like they want as far as the series told. Some of these families came out and said they did not want to dig up old wounds and be left alone so not sure where they stand."
8.0,2 October 2022,"Dahmer is horrific. Everything about it is macabre, depressing and disturbing. You feel his victims' terror and you feel the horror his parents must have felt as it dawned on them what their son was. The show charts Dahmer's childhood and adolescence so you can see how warped he was and how people interacted with him - some, like his father, well-meaning others driven away by his weirdness. At no time is his life glamorized or his crimes fetishized. Everything about him is laid bare so you can see just how disgusting a human being he was and just how much pain he caused.

This is powerful film making with incredible performances. Highly recommend, but it won't cheer you up, there is no redemptive arc here, no light at the end of the tunnel."
10.0,9 October 2022,
10.0,6 October 2022,"This was by far the best representation of the infamous serial killer we have seen so far, Evan Peters absolutely blew the role out of the water and I think completely exceeded everyone expectations, although as it was ""Based"" on a true story not all aspects were 100% historically accurate, but it was still an amazing watch, I enjoyed watching Jeffrey unfold and watch how this firstly strange child turned into a 17 victim serial killer. Evan peters was the perfect actor to play this role and the cast was amazing, everyone was picked exactly perfectly. I'm extremely impressed with how the series turned out."
10.0,23 November 2022,
10.0,27 November 2022,"This can easily be one of the best ""based on true story"" series on Netflix. Very good acting performances and very nice camera shots, scenes and atmospheres. Pretty hard to watch I would say.

Showing Jeffery's lifespan starting from when he was a little kid trying to make the viewer understand the reasons behind his sick twisted sexual desires and compulsion is something I really loved in the show.

It is the most disturbing series I have ever seen so far, and I believe the director nailed it. It opens your mind about how complex humans' minds can be and how far they can go.

Overall, this is a great show to watch."
9.0,15 November 2022,"The story of Jeffery Dahmer is gut wrenching and this series captures it so well. The actor, Evan Peters, plays Dahmer amazingly (it was scary how similar he was to the real monster), you can tell he put a lot of time and effort into practicing. This man definitely deserves many awards for this role! The first episode started off a bit slow and didn't grab me straight away however I persevered and from then on the story was too intriguing to give up watching. The series has an eerie ambience to it which is perfect for the story being told and it really encapsulates the horrific actions of the serial killer. If you love crime documentaries then this is one you should add to your list."
10.0,22 September 2022,"When something is made, it's always about Jeffrey Dahmer, his side of view, what he felt and to glorify the ''mystic part'' of the killer and his psyche.

Here in this mini-series, I feel for the very first time, the viewers are compelled to live it exactly (or as closed to) as it was from the victims's eyes. Obviously not to the same extent as they felt at that time, but it has the dread and the eerie feeling to it. They didn't take time to show the gory part too much, since it was filmed as if you were the person in the room with him.

It has been amazingly done, it's crushing, from the perpetretor's family to the victim's, the unprofesionnalism of the police, the racism still in place at that time, it's enraging, and eye-opener. It's a real cinematographic masterpiece."
10.0,7 October 2022,"Prior to watching to this, I had seen a few documentaries about Dahmer. After seeing the great reviews, we decided to watch this. Yes, it can be slow at times, but there is a reason for that. This show follows the real story, from actual reports taken from Dahmer himself after he was arrested. Yes, it's disturbing what he did to these men, but I felt the directors and producers put this together as tastefully as they could given the events that happened. One thing that surprised me the most was the performance of Evan Peters. He was spot on playing Dahmer. He even got his voice down exactly! I don't know why people are up in their feelings about this. If you don't wanna watch a movie about Dahmer, don't push play! It's that easy. There are far worse shows out there. Evan Peters deserves an Emmy for this."
1.0,6 October 2022,"Wow, just wow one of the best shows I ever watched in my life. I went into this with no expectations and wind up watching the whole entire series in one day. Evan Peters is absolutely one of the greatest actors in Hollywood right now. Every single person casted in this show was 10/10 and almost spot on to every real person including the victims. This is the only show on Netflix I watched where I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. So disturbing yet so mesmerizing to even think that this is true events. There were points during this show where I had to literally pause it and literally just have full on conversations with my girlfriend. This is by far the best depiction of Jeffery dahmer ever. No debate."
9.0,24 September 2022,"I've always liked Evan Peters. This mini series made me love him. He is absolutely the best actor to portray a killer since Zodiac. I honestly don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. Nonetheless, he was phenomenal. Every actor in this is outstanding as well. I can't think of a single bad performance. I hate binge watching shows most of the time. I usually can't watch more than 1 or 2 episodes every other night or so. I finished this in a day.

Do yourself a huge favor (if you enjoy a good serial killer movie or series) watch this immediately.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was showered in awards and Evan Peters is hailed as one of the best actors of the decade. I may sound like I'm over exaggerating. But, to me, this was one of the best performances I've seen in years."
9.0,20 September 2024,"This show feels like Ryan Murphy read a few books, watched a few documentaries and tried to find a way to cast as many attractive young men in the show so he can write for them to get naked and pose provocatively on camera. The irony is not lost on me that a show called 'Monster' in which this season deals with sexual abuse could very well be art imitating life in more ways than you expect. The acting is solid but the real life story could have been told in a better way instead of Ryan Murphy throwing his usual 'did you know about this' dialogue and his trademark montages which fill up enough runtime to push it to 9 episodes."
10.0,27 September 2022,"This show is great. It's so disturbing that I can't stop thinking it about it in my free time, which means it was done right. If Netflix keeps on pumping out quality shows of this caliber, they won't have to worry about all of the competitors (who copied their model) taking them down. Long live Netflix!

I can't understand why the critics aren't on board with this show either. It just comes to show you how out of touch they are with the audience-ya know, the ones who matter. The ones who actually consume the show and give Netflix money.

Watch the show and ignore the critics. These are the same people who gave She-Hulk incredible reviews while giving this masterpiece of a show a rubbish rating."
10.0,24 September 2022,"I really loved this series. The actors who played the brothers are tremendously talented. Especially the one who played Erik. And not to mention they were bother sexy as all hell! Wowza! I never really took to Chloe, who plays Kitty, but she was good. The first 7 episodes were great. I found the last couple slow moving. But it would be interested to get the actual truth from the brothers about their life and parents, but I guess we never will. I love these crime series. Dahmer was my favorite. I love Evan Peters so much. He is a very underrated actor, and I truly hope the brothers in this movie get a lot more respect from Hollywood and cast them in more serious drams like this. Great actors are hard to come by these days. I feel there aren't any movie stars anymore, but the boys and Peters are Oscar worthy performers to me."

8.0,27 September 2022,"Whatever the wrongs and rights about this film being put out there .It's a compelling watch and incredibly well acted .From start to finish, it tells the true story of a madman .Surely one of the most vile men ever to have been born and left to commit his reign of terror .Thankfully some kind of justice was served on him in jail .Electric chair or something more inhuman would have been more fitting for this monster .The heinous crimes did happen though and deserves to be told in my opinion .And a story like this,is only valid if it's told with accuracy .For example "" Once in a lifetime in Hollywood "" is just a silly film for me and makes a mockery of the Tate killings .This sticks to much of what happened and that's what makes it compelling viewing."
4.0,28 September 2022,"If I was the family of the victims I would sue the police for millions for sheer neglect.

This series is absolutely distrubing and terrifying and this monster deserves hell at no end.

The police is also need to face justice for sheer neglect and not a care in the world.

A series not for the faint of hearts.

The performance of the actors is amazing and the actor that plays Dahmer dies it so well.

One of the darkest Neftlix series I have ever seen and it drives me mad that this monster got away with alot. The police needs to learn alot more and start believing people more. I think race was a other issue in the series."
8.0,23 September 2022,"The accuracy shown in this show is beyond incredible.

I had low expectations like many others, but this has gone beyond everything I've imagined. As someone who was immensely interested in Dahmer's case for years, I am amazed at even the smallest details shown.

This is thanks to someone called Victor, who worked on this series to correct anything and everything. I have followed along with Victor's interest with this case and I can see just how much this potentially improved each episode. Thank you for your work, I will miss your content greatly.

Besides the accuracy, this has been far better than any other ""biopic"" or loosely based film of Dahmer's case. The performance shown from every single actor was phenomenal. I loved how it didn't try to romanticize Dahmer in any way, and showed how horrible of a man he was. (unlike other media) It also focused greatly on the victims, which is not only important to the majority but also show empathy towards their families and loved ones, which horrifically, people tend to forget or ignore.

10/10."

10.0,26 September 2022,"Yet again one of the most underrated actors of our generation knocks it out of the park. Peters becomes almost unrecognisable as he portrays Dahmer and gives easily his best performance to date. This show is definitely not one for the faint at heart, it's unsettling and disturbing in many ways. But for those that love the true crime aspect and haven't a weak stomach will have much to enjoy here. Each episode breaks up bits of Dahmer's life and in no way glorifies him. The show does a fantastic job, especially with Peters staring as the killer, of showing just how much of a monster he really was. A must watch for true crime fans."
10.0,1 October 2022,"I am an avid fan of all things that show how a twisted mind operates. I've seen a plethora of true crime shows, docs about murderers and films/series based on true life events. This stood out more than most. The acting was superb (I've had my eye on Peters since AHS and knew he was a major talent) and the creep factor was, well, let's just say that sometimes I felt transported into the screen. All so realistically done you will want to binge watch all 10 episodes. So start early, or stay up all night like I did. Dahmer was an unusual case study. As bad as he was, he was not in the same league as sexual sadists such as Bundy, Gacy, BTK, Lake and Ng, the list goes on. They received pleasure from prolonging their victims suffering, torturing and maiming them for as long as they could keep them alive. I'm not downplaying Dahmers actions and their effect on all involved. I won't say any more, just watch this excellent series where Dahmer is brought to life onscreen."
10.0,22 September 2022,"I'm only on Ep.5, and this has far exceeded my expectations. Evan Peters truly becomes Jeffery Dahmer, to his lack of intellect, to rages and outbursts, to the anticipation of the build-up of the sexual arousal Jeffery accumulates while going through his experiences / experiments on victims. You truly feel like you're getting to know Jeffery Dahmer, as Evan Peters perfectly guides you on a walk through his deranged mind. It's evident Dahmer has always been an outcast, and fact of the matter is he's always known that he was. He had temptations that would never silence, and would get worse and grow louder overtime. I am not sympathizing Dahmer, but there is a reason he was sloppy with his victims it's because he never truly feared being caught, he simply adhered to his temptations, with no ulterior motive to keep on doing it.

Wicked and disturbing to see just how even more corrupt our system was during this time period, while we assumed he was clever and escaped the police; the fact of the matter was during that time frame the police chose to look the other way when it came to homosexuals and the black community.

Now and days we tend to glorify there masterminds in being a serial killer, but this series depicts perfectly how one becomes a serial killer diving into the mind of how it can begin.

While there is not much gore, it is by far one of the most disturbing things I've seen blood or not, because of how surreal this all is and knowing this series is HEAVILY fact-based."
1.0,3 October 2022,"Nothing short of a masterpiece, feels like watching an exceptional documentary. This gives off similar vibes to the Chernobyl miniseries by being so detailed and moody. I cannot say anything negative about this one and definitely don't listen to any haters because this a true gem in the world of true crime. Ryan Murphy is a genius. The acting is remarkable. The directing is spotless. I of course was looking forward to this series but it surpassed my expectations. A sensitive and delicate approach to this heavy character and his dreadful story. This is not in any way exploitation, it is a thriller, drama, true crime biopic kind of thing, very smart and builds masterfully."
10.0,20 September 2024,"Ryan Murphy took this sad story of child sexual abuse and made it in to his sick psychotic fantasy. Ryan Murphy has been a problem since he released Season 1 Dahmer by not asking victims family for permission. Absolutely horrible, disgusting and disrespectful show throughout 🤢😡😭

I wanted them to get justice from this show but all it did was traumatize them and make it worse. Over sexualizing them was completely wrong and this is why boys and men are less likely to come forward. It made me cry. Everyone knew about the abuse and no one helped them. In open court there were so many witnesses.

The title speaks volumes, they aren't monsters they were just trying to get out of the sexual abuse and to stop the dad from doing it to them or anyone else. Netflix and Ryan Murphy are the real monsters."
9.0,3 November 2022,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is the next best thing to watch when you've already powered through both seasons of ""Mindhunter"" and you're hungry for the next best thing while Mindhunter floats in development limbo.

This is a creepy, depiction of Dahmer's life, told mostly from his point of view, which at times seems to argue that Dahmer was a victim of both nature AND nurture, and suggesting he deserves some bit of sympathy. And maybe he does, but nothing can justify the evil actions he chose to make. And the show does a decent job illustrating just how heinous his crimes actually were.

It's pretty disturbing, especially for someone not used to seeing things like subjective cannibalism, true crime photos, and horrible reenactments that are highly sexualized on screen.

It's interesting to learn the facts about Dahmer, albeit through a more stylized, produced semi-fictional portrayal. What is it about serial killers that we find fascinating? Maybe it's because they are able to do things beyond our own comprehension or capabilities. Maybe because like the song ""Vicarious"" by Tool, we live vicariously through the most evil and violent characters on TV because they can do the most atrocious acts that we can only imagine, without any consequences, because they are merely characters in a show, and they can get away acting out the most vile thoughts of our own collective imaginations, and we can sit and enjoy it without the fear of reaping any of the ramifications.

Or maybe there's no deep explanation, and some of us viewers just find it fascinating. Regardless, it's a great show, well made, and Evan Peters proves without a doubt he is an EXCELLENT actor."
10.0,3 October 2024,"First time I've written some movie reviews here, and realized there's a word limit, so I can't be too short.

I think this is a drama that is more entertainment than fact, such as talking about brother incest this particular plot, Eric's real sexual orientation is what exactly, and a lot of eye-catching footage, the father of the character male prostitute to engage in a role-playing game, but these gorgeous details do not seem to be from the true perspective of events. But from the overall episode completion and quality is also very high, because this drama shooting is very difficult, his relatively simple story volume can support enough nine episodes is a problem, but I saw a lot of ingenuity of the director and the design of the bridge against the past Ryan Murphy's work, as is the case in the past, are from the different perspectives of an event unfolding, so that the audience themselves to evaluate the authenticity of it and the rich world inside the character. Worthy of fans praise is the fifth episode of Eric's self-narrative, in the history of the TV series are rarely expressed in the form, but can make the audience completely quiet to listen to a horror of the past.

Loved the two young new actors, Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch, they were creating with emotion and had a very interesting personality that flowed out of them in the scene and in interviews, a great chemistry pairing. They were both very emotional and very proud and happy to see this lgbt actor on board, Cooper was very consistent throughout his performance, lots of glances and smiles were captivating.

It's a shame that I didn't see Ryan Murphy's usual actor Cody Fern in this show, he would have been perfect for the role of Eric five or six years ago, and he could have interpreted a great killer with his good looks and solid acting skills. Looking at the projects that Cody has been involved in since American Crime Story, not many of them have been able to generate buzz and discussion, so I hope Ryan Murphy will reconsider casting him in the future!"
10.0,25 October 2022,"I don't understand why the victims families are angry when they can just NOT WATCH the show? If it is traumatizing to watch then why are you watching it? Anyways, I literally had no idea who Dahmer was until watching this show so it was very educational and everyone should know about this stuff. This generation needs to know how horrible white people were back then, how bad racism was, how white cops acted, how horrible men behaved keeping their emotions hidden and how serious mental health can impact someone and everyone NEEDS MENTAL HELP. Dahmer knew what he did was wrong and he literally wanted to die because of it. God loves and forgives ALL, even those like Jeffery Dahmer. I believe Jeff's baptism was REAL because he didn't want to commit those things, he had urges and it's all a very sad story for both sides."
10.0,22 September 2022,"Evan Peters is an amazing actor! His versatility and range for the complex characters he plays is nothing short of amazing! No spoilers, but the first episode will have you hooked, I love this guy (Peters) not Dahmer, haha. Jeffrey Dahmer has had many a movies made about him, but this one has so many little detailed scenes and it's not rushed. So, thankful for 10 episodes of brilliant acting and not to mention, Niecy Nash really surprised me with acting shops, I didn't know she had that in her! After you watch the first episode the movie art of Peters eyes will make sense, just brilliant. I rate this a 10!"
10.0,27 September 2022,"There's anything like this show when the topic is Serial Killer biography.

The acting, story telling, everything is just perfect.

Evan Peters just hit the maximum level of acting. You feeling that you're inside the scenes, living each moment e suffering with the victims.

We can't forget to talk about others players in the field, like Richard Jenkings acting as Jeffrey father, Niecy Nash as Jeffrey neighbour and every 'victim' of this monster: believe me, they look really scared when the death moment comes.

Anyway, just WATCH and enjoy this stunning show. Thank you Netflix! And don't stop doing shows like this."
4.0,3 October 2022,
8.0,26 October 2022,"But, I'm not a believer in 1 star or 10 star ratings. Those ratings exist purely to sway the overall rating , which is not how anyone should be reviewing something. This had me drawn in at first, because I thought it was going to be a true telling of what they learned about Dahmer, his thought process, how it might help spot, catch and maybe prevent serial killers and shed some light on who his victims were. You know, something that effect. However, what we discover early on, is that it is a story that blatantly lies to you over and over, makes up it's own characters and events and how they happened and turns it into another Netflix Lifetime movie. Honestly, between Amazon Prime, Hulu, Shudder, Paramount, HBO Max, Tubi, Pluto and more, there is less and less of a reason to keep them around."
8.0,25 September 2022,"I've never been a fan of starting at the end, and then going back to f. Ex. ""2 weeks earlier"". In this show they go totally nuts with this. Also, there are parallel stories that does similar things with the chronological pace.

This is more of a sigh though, it doesn't change how good the show as a whole is. It manage to show how cold and gruesome Dahmer was. Evan Peters is amazing and gives face to Dahmer almost too well I imagine.

I know him from American Horror Stories. He was one that made it as good as it is, until they messed it up bad.

One more sigh... what the heck is it with Americans and religion? Is it still such a big thing today, like at the time this show depicts?"
8.0,30 September 2022,"Masterpiece in so many levels!! In my opinion is not disrespectful in any way, more the opposite, it tell the story from the victims side, which without this series i would never know about it. Ive watched alot of true crime in my time, also about jeffrey dahmer and most been just talking about the murderer perspective, but this series is different. Its not gruesome,and there's no very explicit killings but it is daaaark and heartbreaking. But its so worth watching.

Superb acting and storytelling filmed in the most amazing way! One of the best series I've watched! Evan Peters you deserve all the awards 👏🏽"
10.0,13 October 2022,"The series starts with an amazing 4-5 episodes that have you on the edge of your seat. The acting is superb, the story is captivating and the flow of the series is decent. Unfortunately (as usual) they should have cut the remaining 5 episodes into 3. There is too much focus on activists, racial questions and side characters like Jeff's neighbour Glenda and the Laotian family. But hey, it's Netflix, so what do expect. It's still a very good TV series and worth a watch.

Evan Peters delivered an outstanding job and deserves some major recognition for this role. Really looking forward to see him in any future productions."
10.0,1 November 2023,
10.0,18 October 2022,"Very well thought out by the producers, directors, cast & crew...

From start to finish it's very gripping and delves deep, not only into the story behind what he did but the victims, the victims family, friends, his family & the general public who also suffered from what he did.

You will not be disappointed. Its very sad in parts and you really feel like you are there at times & even feel the fear some of his victims must have felt at the time.

Absolute must see and it is an excellent watch!

Hats off to the cast & crew, the acting is impeccable and they have done an amazing job, well done!"
1.0,4 October 2022,"Watched it in a dim lit lamp room. All Characters even less screen time were perfectly cast, & editing was good even with all information being explained well. I think the Production design exceeded for me as it is right up there with Mind hunter which is my No.1 Netflix show.

Dialogues were very we'll panned out & the episode length was pretty much right. I haven't seen My friend Dahmer which among these reviews someone has mentioned it actually is a informative Prequel, which I'll check out.

Lot of Buzz going on for the extremely high viewings for this show it definitely deserves it.

I hope Netflix focus on these kind of Shows in future."
10.0,20 September 2024,"""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" tries to tackle a deeply complex, infamous case but ends up feeling scattered and uncohesive. One of the biggest issues with the show is its frustrating attempt to include every possible theory surrounding the Menendez brothers' motives - even the outlandish and unsupported ones. This approach doesn't add depth but instead leaves the audience lost in a jumble of contradictions. The result feels like the show doesn't trust the viewers to form their own opinions and instead throws everything at the wall to see what sticks.

Lyle Menendez is portrayed in such an exaggerated way, it's as if the writers took inspiration from a Nicolas Cage movie. His character often feels more like a caricature than a real person. Whether it's his delivery of lines or dramatic outbursts, the portrayal feels inconsistent and almost comedic.

The episodes themselves feel like they were written by five different people who never once collaborated. There's a jarring tonal shift from one episode to the next, making the story feel disjointed and hard to follow. This lack of coherence weakens the narrative, making it hard to invest in the story or the characters.

The focus on Dunne, a writer and journalist, feels like a self-indulgent inclusion that detracts from the central story.

Overall, ""Monsters: the Lyle and Erik Menendez Story"" is a missed opportunity. While the Menendez case offers plenty of material for a compelling exploration of crime, family dynamics, sexual abuse and justice, this show spreads itself too thin with too many wild theories, uneven character portrayals, and disconnected storytelling."
10.0,4 October 2022,"The series was hard to binge watch because of such a horrific crime he had done, and just imagining this series on what the victims , there family and his family, suffered because of him, I feel sick to my stomach watching this, but the directors and actors in this show they must have a hard time doing this series. It opens our eyes to the injustice system of this country, let this be the last series we have to make about this monster, it took me forever to finished this series cause it was hard to Watch episode by episodes , it's just so realistic, I felt like this series took me to the victims lives and I cried a lot!"
8.0,10 October 2022,"I've seen a lot of people discuss the ethical shades of grey when it comes to making a show such as this. Whether it's giving this dude more attention or not contacting the real-life victims or whatever else is being said.

Personally, I'm not interested in these debates. The morality of cinema has always been a topic I've intentionally steered away from, because who am I to say what is and isn't ""right"".

My top priority is always story. And as far as this one goes, I was far more impressed than I thought I would be. However, I do think it starts to lose itself a bit once the focus moves away from Jeffrey/his father and emphasizes too much on the impact of the victims. I imagine this was intended to pay tribute to the real-life people, but nonetheless it resulted in a serious drag in the overall narrative.

In my opinion, the show hits the hardest when it remains fixated on Jeffrey's spiral into madness and the ever-increasing evolution of his relationship with his father. Once that moves from the spotlight, it becomes a bit monotonous.

But overall, this was an extraordinarily fascinating show."
8.0,2 October 2022,"Just WOW.... where do I begin.... first of all, Evan Peters played Jeffrey Dahmer BRILLIANTLY...perfection.. the best portrayal I have ever seen... his look, accent, idiosyncrasies, everything.... outstanding....then there's the story... the music, acting, costumes.... all great.... you really get a sense about what went on during this time and what the victims went through... with a deep feeling of sympathy for their families. I liked that this series wasn't done in the perspective of Jeffrey... but rather the young men and others his crimes so deeply effected and whose lives will never be the same. It told the whole story completely and left nothing out. If this does not earn Evan Peters and Niecy Nash Emmy awards and Golden Globe awards, then I would be very shocked. Kudos to the writers, directors, and everyone involved with this awesome show that did a great job in not glorifying Dahmer."
8.0,30 September 2022,"Wow! Wow! Wow! Murphy back at it again!!! Who would've thought a Tv show of a Real-life tragedy could be this Good. This right here is a True Cinema Spectacul!

I don't know if Evan Peters will ever be the same again! He portrayed this Real-life Monster so well that even as a ""not easily getting scared"" guy Myself got chills in my spine like never before!! Evan did a great job so were the supporting actors. Great Story, Great Cinematography, but never were the real Memories and tragedy for the Victims families, besides the messed up real history that this show remind us about, this is a MASTERPIECE!!!"
9.0,14 October 2022,"Why did I give it 10 stars? Because Even Peters played the role of Jeffrey Dahmer damn well. He is exactly the right cast for this character. Peters convinced me from the beginning, the facial expressions, the character, just everything.

In itself Dahmer has led a very sad life and also in the documentary it showed me that he did all the terrible things he did because of his sad soul, his fears of loss are shaped by his home, his parents. He had no bond with his mother and his father, with whom he seemed to have a beautiful and loving relationship, was pretty much not there for him at all. In my assumption lies that Dahmer in itself possibly had bizarre character traits, which is not unnatural, because there are many different people, but in his case they were negatively influenced by family circumstances.

Ultimately, however, the victims have experienced so much violence and cruelty and it is incomprehensible to normal people how someone can do so much absurd that there is no excuse for all this. All these cruelties lie in Dahmer's maldevelopment, from which also his schizophrenic perceptions result, from which others suffered and still suffer today."
1.0,16 October 2022,"I have so much to say and not sure how to put it in words to describe what I'm feeling and thinking. I guess I will start with saying how sorry I am for the family's that may be impacted and how horrific this must of been for them. The acting is incredible, outstanding and brilliant. They all should receive awards! It is crazy to think of how many victims could of have been saved if individuals have done their jobs throughly. I feel for everyone that was involved, and hope we can learn what not to do/ or can do if something ever were to happen/reported. If you are easily scared or bothered you shouldn't watch this. In the first episode I just kept thinking how horrible it would feel to be stuck/trapped."
10.0,5 October 2022,
10.0,8 October 2022,"As shocking and horrific this period was ... the series was very well made. Evan Peters playing his role to a T with regards to Dahmers' mannerisms and behaviour.

Credit also to Niecy Nash and Richard Jenkins for their role in the series, as neighbour and father respectively. Even though they can be discrepancies all round its a well made series.

Don't understand the flack it did get in certain quarters of the media and entertainment media. Best watch it yourself to make your OWN judgement.

From episode 1 to 10 it certainly had me gripped even though one followed this case in my late teens."
10.0,4 October 2022,"This portrayal of the Jeffrey Dahmer story is so real. I am glad they don't disrespect the families by showing EVERYTHING that he did. Everyone knows he was a wicked man who inflicted evil on so many undeserving people.

Evan Peters did a fantastic job as Dahmer, he captured the essence of how much of a deranged creep he was and his acting was excellent. Richard Jenkins also delivers as Lionel Dahmer. Each episode you can feel his pain and agony as a father wrestling with a lost child.

This series is extremely creepy and kind of humorous in a very dark way. The fact that the Milwaukee Police were so helplessly blind to Jeffrey Dahmer's presence is just insane to me. It's almost like willful ignorance was at play but I hate to speculate against law enforcement because it is such a tough job.

I doubt I'll ever watch this series again but I would certainly recommend it to a friend, it is too intriguing to look away."
8.0,23 October 2022,"It's a good series as a series. Stunning. Production design and acting were very good. I knew about Dahmer, but he was someone I didn't research. What they did were very bad and terrible. In the last parts of the series, they brought the subject to unnecessary topics, but there was no need. As always, when someone like him occurred, first of all, their childhood and relationships with their parents are discussed, which I think was a very valid issue. What can we say about Dahmer? What they did was very bad and terrible. Of course, there would be some people who admired him. It intrigued me, but I'm not a fan of course. When the trailer of the series came out, it caught my attention and I added it to my watch list. But I didn't expect the series to be watched this much. For some reason, I lose my interest when it comes to a series or movie that suddenly became famous and watched a lot like Squid Game. So I waited a bit and passed it on. It's a good series, but I didn't like the way some subjects were handled."
8.0,11 May 2024,"Dahmer = 10/10

Positive:

Evan Peters as Dahmer is great. He embodies the role of the killer with perfection and manages to capture the creepy aura and facial expressions of the character. The blank stare, the look and even the way he talks brings Evan Peters across brilliantly.

Contrary to expectations, the plot is extremely complex and is not just your average killer horror story.

All aspects of Dahmer's life are examined in detail and his development into a killer is analyzed from his birth onwards. But his family, the victims and other characters from Dahmer's life not only serve as accessories but are also complex characters, especially Dahmer's father, and have their own plot.

The story tells a lot more than just about the murders, but also asks some moral questions and deals with the impact of this man on society. Topics such as racism, religion and good and evil are covered.

But the series also has a lot to offer in terms of production. The murders are brutal, gruesome and keep you glued to the screen. The dark aura of the apartment, the helplessness of the victims and Dahmer's cruel and disturbing actions are conveyed in a horrific way.

Negatives: /"

10.0,29 October 2022,As entertainment it was very slow and about 4 episodes too long. Painfully drawn out in my opinion. Evan Peters is a great actor and did a phenomenal job in his role. But really it paid too much attention to Dahmer and not enough to the lives of his victims. It would have been better to see how they lived before they met their untimely end than to see so much time spent on their killer. Time to stop glorifying the stories of serial killers. People forget that he was a true psychopath and real people lost their lives in these horrifying ways. Their families are still living on. I forced myself to watch the series the whole way through but really I'm left wondering if that was even the right choice...

10.0,10 October 2022,"This show is somehow intense, bingeworthy, and a beautiful artistic show at the same time. I find this combination hard to come by.

I am a regular true crime consumer. I thought I knew a lot about Dahmer already, but watching this show was eye opening. I feel like the writers did a wonderful job of showing us Dahmer's perspective, and what made him the killer we know him to be. It was hard for me to watch at times.

I can't say enough about Evan Peters. He's an underrated, phenomenal actor. He becomes his character. At times, I forgot that this is an actor, not Dahmer. I don't get creeped out easily, but he definitely gave me the creeps. He's truly brilliant!

I've had issues with other documentaries or true crime dramas because they tend to glorify the killer. Not this one! There are times when I might have empathized with him (when he was younger), but he is certainly not glorified. We see a lot more about the victims. I especially loved watching the episode about Tony. The fact that we see the victim's perspective, even in the cinematography and audio, is amazing.

I understand some people have issues with certain liberties that the creators have taken, but I don't think they deviate from the main tragedy or events. I knew going in that Glenda wasn't the next door neighbor, but it didn't bother me.

Some people also have an issue with the show trying to be ""woke."" It's really not. While I can't attest to the prank calls and few other details, much of the frustration we feel with the investigation (or lack thereof) is true. Dahmer was operating during a time when racism, homophobia, and misconceptions around HIV were rampant. Not that these issues have ended, but it was much worse then. We can't deny that.

I think the show is beautifully done, and the actors have done a phenomenal job. It's not a gorefest, but it's disturbing. I went in with high expectations, and the show went beyond them! I really recommend giving this show a chance."
9.0,29 September 2022,"This the first serial killer documentary that was ultimately so disturbing and unsettling. Could not stop watching until I finished every episode. The acting is absolutely incredible by all the main characters. Evan Peters never fails to fully embrace a character as he does with this show, and Neicy Nash was a phenomenal actress that really help out you into the shoes of someone who was so negatively impacted by just knowing Jeffrey Dahmer as an individual. This series is very dark but accurately highlights the horrors that went along with this whole scenario in the late 80s and 90s

Truly an impressive mini series that highlights that terrifying life of Jeffrey Dahmer."
8.0,25 September 2022,"When I saw this I thought, do we really need another Dahmer movie? It's been done many time. But turns out we did. Excellent portrayals that will haunt your psychy. I haven't finished it yet but I can honestly say it is very well made and nothing like the previous exploitative slasher films. We all know the story so there is no point in giving anything away. But if your into true crime and the events and psychological disposition of those that commit these atrocities this is one of the better ones. Say what you want about Netflix, they killed it. I just wish Mind Hunter would have continued, but this makes up for it a little."
10.0,28 September 2022,"I feel guilty simply because so many people lost their lives and we are watching it like an entertainment (of their grief). I am sorry to have watched this but , long back I had watched a documentary about this man dahmer , and it never gave such insights. It did mention his story but never told in this way. By the end of the documentary I thought ""ok Atleast he confessed "" but after watching this series it gave a whole new perspective about the victims and their family and how it affected all of them. It's truly a horror story !! And also some insight into how he grew into becoming a monster. RIP to those poor young souls and also the victims families. And a special mention of the main lead Evan - was truly amazing acting ."
1.0,25 September 2022,"I swear this dude THINKS he knows everything while he dont have a clue...So whatever he says just erase it and think the opposite...The show is phenomenaly good...Direction is amazing,the climax its on point and Evan Peters gives a perfomance worth for Emmy Awards...Its so clever and just to not ONLY see the monster he became but HOW and WHY and that series made it PERFECTLY...No i dont feel sorry for Jeffrey Dahmer there is no excuse for murdering so many people in such brutal way but nobody born as a monster and neither did Jeffrey...So enjoy the show for what it is...As for the haters they always have something to complain so just ignore them."
9.0,27 September 2022,"Why are there so many documentaries glorifying and idolizing these ""people"" that did unspeakable things. Remember the victims and stop putting out stories for their families to relive these tragic events. Dahmers name should be forgotten just like all the other killers. You wanna make a fictional suspenseful show about a psychopathic killer? By all means do. I've seen Halloween, I've seen them all, but leave the real ones to rot and to be forgotten about. You're only fulfilling the attention that dahmer wanted his whole life, and giving him exactly what he wanted. I made it to episode three before I couldn't take it anymore because these directors are framing him in a light where you're supposed to actually feel bad for him."
10.0,26 September 2022,"In my opinion, the Netflix DAHMER series might be the best true crime film/show I've seen and brings to light a lot of things that are important and shouldn't be shoved under the rug. It's extremly well written, acted and directed. Depicting a real life tragedy is never easy, and it's bound to make some people angry. True crime dramatization will always be controversial, but I believe the show really means well. It honors the victims and survivors and brings a light to the social injustices and incompetence of the police that led to a killing spree that should never have went on as long as it did. Episode 6, ""Silenced"", was one of the most gut wrenching and well made episodes in any television series I've ever seen and truly started to bring things into perspective after the shocking first half of the series. For those who might have been unable to get past episode 6, I urge you to continue on. The series starts off shocking and full horror, but I have to say the second half is what makes it so good by honoring the victims and the survivors. In my opinion, its a great example of how to appropriately approach a true crime story of a sensitive nature and how to approach social injustices in America that so many writers want to write about these days with all that's going on in our time. The crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer just doesn't tell a scary story... It's an important event in American history that should not be forgotten. The writers should be proud. I'm hoping this series will set a higher bar for the writing behind Netflix original content. 10/10."
10.0,23 September 2022,
10.0,24 September 2022,"Before I begin, I want to make it clear that I do not enjoy horror nor the true crime genre - I pressed play on episode 1 as I remembered a Dahmer being mentioned in Lost eons ago buried in the boggy silt of my memory and wondered about the connection lol..

I was RIVETED to my seat. When the first episode finished, my heart was thrashing and I was boggling at how there could possibly be more to the story and was ready to be bored with lengthy court scenes. Wrong!

This was so well written. I wasn't there, obviously, so I cannot speak to the truth of what went through each person's mind and of their experiences - but this felt real and rings true. We see Dahmer: the man and the monster; his victims; his family; his neighbours; the police; and, dear lord, how very few steps forward we've taken since the 90's

I've read that the victims' families have not been involved in this production. I hope that's not true! I dearly hope that Netflix is sharing the profits with them, or will build the Memorial Garden.

(Message to Netflix: you're being demonised in the media.. show everyone your money's where your heart is!

With love, K x)"
10.0,22 September 2022,"The show is one of the very few Dahmer presentations that show respect for the victims and their families IMO.

Additionally it sufficiently calls out the failures of law enforcement and the backdrop of urban decay with racial tension... much of which still exists today in blue collar Americana.

Much of the intrigue still lies in the enigma of Dahmer as a quasi sympathetic monster. The fact he was murdered was a missed opportunity to further understand the nature/nurture paradox underpinning most all serial killers.

Some superb performances all round, especially Joyce and Lionel Dahamer. Evan Peters wore pure Evil like a second skin; a creepy yet nuanced masterclass.

My heart goes out to the 17 souls and their families. Let's not forget what this is about."
10.0,13 October 2022,
2.0,4 October 2022,"This LGBT True Crime documentary is outstanding!

I wasn't really going to watch this series as I don't really have time to settle into digesting and dissecting the material. This however, caught my attention as it garnered a great deal of controversy as well as high-level praise.

Having just put it on today, I'm already halfway through the entire series. It's put together and acted so well, that it had fully immersed me in its material, to the point that I'd forgotten that I'd even had it on.

Absolutely OUTSTANDING performance from Evan Peters.

The supporting cast also help make this cohesive, enabling an easy sell.

Excellent work, Ryan Murphy!"
8.0,29 September 2022,"I had to settle on a 5 rating. The series was well done. It mostly stuck to the facts, while making an interesting narrative flow for the series. That being said, they could've done the families of the victim's the courtesy of contacting them, asking their permission, asking if they'd like certain things included or omitted, or even informed them that the series would be coming out ahead of time. The series makes a point that people were exploitative of the families at the end of the show, yet, curiously does the exact same thing. The families and living victims aren't benefiting from this series at all, they're just having to be re-traumatized AGAIN. The gratuitous gore and violence do not help, I know they say they tried to keep it to a minimum, but anyone who's watched it knows there is plenty in there for shock factor. I'd have given it a higher rating if they'd have been more mindful. If it was fiction it would've been an enthralling show. But these are living people's lives and pain being portrayed, that had no say in the making of the series, that just doesn't sit well with me."
9.0,5 October 2022,"This is a crazy, sick and psychotic story about a damaged young man. He has so many repressed emotions, he constantly tries to be heard, in his own way, but no one around him even tries to listen. The adults in his life keep dictating his path, completely ignoring what he feels and thinks. I suspect that the real events, the most disturbing ones, and the real evil side of Dahmer aren't shown here. From time to time they expose his real evil, what you can't really sense in his day to day life as presented in the show.. from time to time they expose an extremely disturbing situation, giving us a glimpse of his crazed, lost mind. This show is creepy and depressing, they delivered such an in depth look into Dahmer and the people around him, yet managed to tone down the insanity, making it watchable. Very well made show."
8.0,27 September 2022,"I knew this mini series was going to be tough to watch, and I was right. It was extremely disturbing and at times I had to look away or turn it off completely until I could go back and continue watching. But ... it was excellent! The creators, writers, and actors did an amazing job telling this horrific story. They took their time and they got it right. It never felt rushed. They did a fantastic job developing the characters so that we could really get to know them as the story unfolded. Evan Peters should be nominated for an Emmy for his performance as Dahmer. He was phenomenal, as was Richard Jenkins and Niecy Nash."
10.0,1 November 2022,"First I thought I couldn't watch it by my own, because the first episode was already intense. But I was very interested, also because of Evan Peters and how he has played Jeffrey is one of the best. It really shows the fact how the police handled this situation and the problem being homophobic at that time. All other actors had played their characters the best as possible, but I really hope that Evan has already started to heal from this dramatic and soul damaging role he needed to play. He prepared for this role as much as he could and indeed did a great job. I can't stop rave about him because he deserve all the best!"
10.0,31 October 2022,"Shows about serial killers, it's just a formula for success, certainly when it's well made like this one. Credits to Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy for that. I binge watched it, like many others did before me. Everything is of top quality in this show, but the acting is what really stands out. Evan Peters just killed it playing Dahmer. He already did it once before in an American Horror Story episode, another hit from Ryan Murphy. He's perfect for this role and not only because his physique looked very similar to the real Dahmer. Niecy Nash was also outstanding playing the worried neighbour. Something different for her this time as comedies are normally more her thing. Richard Jenkins as the father was very convincing as well. Good directing from Jennifer Lynch, glad to see she's doing better things than her father David, well that's only my opinion. The story itself is one almost everyone heard about before, read the story or watched a movie or documentary about it. Of course the whole cannibalism touch to it is disgusting but that's not what disgusted me the most about the story, not even Jeff Dahmer himself. What I found profoundly chocking was the police (non)efforts to catch him, or better said the total ignoring of all facts presented to them. I guess a white boy doing his sick stuff in a mostly coloured neighbourhood, that's just a thing they are not interested in. The police could have prevented a lot of innocent people getting butchered, getting killed, and instead of doing something about that problem they even got rewarded as police officers of the year. What a scandal that is, only possible in America, you know, the land of freedom and opportunities, well that's if you're caucasian though... That said, this series is top notch!"
8.0,23 September 2022,"Firstly, don't believe all the hype about this being a gore fest: It's anything but.

The producers and director have done a remarkable job of balancing drama, tension, and storytelling to create a series that explores the human cost and exposes the societal deficiencies surrounding the case of Jeffery Dahmer.

Evan Peter's ( American Horror Story ) turns in an award winning performance as the grisly cannibaliser-however the series dives into Jeff's upbringing and perhaps some of the major events of his life that played a pivotal role in moulding him.

It doesn't push any particular narrative in this respect-and what it does do very refreshingly is expose the incompetence of the police who could have stopped Dahmer had they heeded the warnings of those around him.

I'm reminded of perhaps ( if possible) the worst case of Nathaniel Bar Jonah who's victims were young children in his case and similarly the system failed to properly appreciate the malevolence brooding within these serial killers.

This also pays proper respect to the victims ( both dead and alive) without dousing the viewer in force fed sentimentality or virtue signalling.

All in all a gripping series that is hard not to become engrossed in, with some important social commentary and excellent performances all round.

Now all we can hope for is Netflix's algorithm to sit up and take notice that this is how a quality series is done."
1.0,23 September 2022,
10.0,23 September 2022,"I can't take this seriously with all the bad writing and inaccuraricies. Would it kill Ryan Murphy to actually do some thorough research and stick to the source material. It's waaaay more compelling. Also, Evan Peters' one note monotone robotic performance is not realistic (combined with his brown eyes and dark hair). Watch the Dahmer family home movies. He came across as an unassuming nice regular Joe schmo. Maybe it's the writing and direction's fault but there are tons of interviews and trial footage to create from so why make up completely inaccurate scenes that discredit the victims true experience? It does a major disservice to the poor victims. I don't like that, especially considering the situation involving the 14 year old boy (character assassination) ALSO.: (The moment with the cops is almost accurate, but should have been handled differently). The Niecy Nash character didn't even live in the same building as him! Get out of here with this fictional mess.

Yes, there are a tiny few solid moments and some of the production designs are spot on, but the inaccuraricies outweigh the few small good moments combined with a lot of boring filler and too many flashbacks. All in typical tasteless Ryan Murphy fashion (couldn't even think of an original title). Skip and stick to an accurate thorough documentary if you're that interested.

I can't rate this higher than a one, unfortunately due to handling of production and the big missing part, humanity."
8.0,26 September 2022,"I hypothesize that aggression and sex co-exist near each other in our brain for they both reward us with pleasure and gratification. Otherwise, how else can you explain away that in all cultures, cussing is always in the form of aggressive sexual expletives? I think our evolution as social animals mandated us to separate violence from sex as a fundamental survival contract between us. A code of right and wrong for coexistence as species. As for this story which is a true story, it is about a young man where his barrier of separation between sex and violence had broken down and the pleasure he had gotten from the combined both became an addictive intoxication which led him to become a predatorial serial killer for the pleasure of his own sexual fantasies. This is a finely crafted series looking to become an Emmy Award contender. Or maybe even Emmy winners, especially for the stellar performances from Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins. Just ace! I do have some quibbles though. The first has to do with the script, it shifted focus from Jeff Dahmer to one of his victims in the second half as a lead-in to espouse on racism. Even though the introduction of the character Tony Hughes was clever, but racism is really a different form of victimization. I think the story pounded too heavily on this point which to me becomes a diffusion more suitable for a different angle and another story based on the same plot. The other quibble I had was how John Wayne Gacy was brought into the story. It was an unnecessary and exploitative spotlight on him just for the sole purpose of underscoring a few lines about repentance from Jeff. My final verdict is a high recommendation but only if you are not offended by the shock of male sex and shocking violence."
9.0,1 October 2022,"This series was absolutely fantastic. So well written, acted and cast. I understand that there has been a lot of backlash to this series, but I found this to be a fresh and authentic take on true crime events. If you're going to click on a series about Jeff Dahmer, you should rightly be prepared to be disturbed, if you're not ok with that, simply don't watch. This is an absolute treat for true crime fans and probably Netflix's best offering in the genre to date. This also leaves much to be excited about for the future, as written into the series were sub plots for other true crime and serial killers to follow in the same realm/style of series. They hinted that Ed Gein and John Wayne Gacy stories could also follow. This is great opportunity for a new collection of series, as after watching Dahmer, you realise it's potential for others. With its title being 'monster', I think an Aileen Wuornos one could be fantastic also. I look forward to see whatever comes next from these writers/directors. 10/10."

8.0,15 October 2022,"This is the show that should be watched by everyone. Once again Rotten Tomatoes gets everything wrong with their reviews. I dont know what kind of crack the critics smoke there. The show is too complex to put in simple words. The important thing is it covers various aspects of the society then and even now in utmost details. Its not just a show about a serial killer. Its also about the victims, the parents the police, the city, the society. Its such a rich and detailed show its unbelievable that someone could put it up. Primarily directed by David Lynch's daughter, she has done a brilliant work."
2.0,1 October 2022,"Yes the show itself it's fantastic but Evan Peters is an outstanding actor. We are witnessing the rise of a new hall of famer in acting. The show teeters on the edge of cringe, sadness, remorse, fear, guilt, and anger. All at the same time in most moments. I've never been this intrigued by something so horrific. Hard not to be though with such amazing acting. The story will jump across a large time line but it doesn't ever feel out of place or confusing, you can follow along very easily. This Peters will lure you in with convincing acting, snatch your emotions, and have you eating from the palm of his hand."
8.0,24 September 2022,"Why are almost all tv/movies becoming political messages or painting white. People as the devil? This kind of message only creates division and will do no good for society! It's time as the human race we work together instead of the terrible nonsense going on today.

10.0,3 October 2022,"Evan is the man!! I wish I had better words to describe this performance, Amazing, outstanding, it's all too common - It was just so totally, absolutely transformative, from even the posture down to the pause before speaking, it's was just perfection! This series itself is just so TENSE and chilling. There's a soft ambient sound that's used in the background that just immediately tenses you up - That sound, and Evan's performance on screen... oh man! It it ever effective! This series should've been a 10, but anyone familiar with Ryan Murphy knows this guys got issues with ""doing too much and knowing when to stop"" - The last two eps were really dragging on and on and on, and it's not that that portion of the story wasn't important to the grander message, it felt totally wedged in... like, it didn't feel organically presented.

I think there had to've been a better way to incorporate that part of they story into the grander Dahmer case - But it's Ryan Murphy so the fact that the show seemed to lose it's way is almost like his trademark.

But don't get me wrong, this one is worth the watch!

Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins were the absolute standouts for me.

20/10 performances, 7 out of 10 presentation/pacing (should've been a little more ""show than tell"" for the crimes, imo) - averaged it to 8/10."
8.0,27 October 2022,"I usually steer clear of movies that cover the lives of the most gruesome of people and acts; one never knows who's getting the money. We do like Evans acting from AHS, so we gave it a look.

I have to admit from the very first scene, I was tense. Only out of high school a few years, this event was all we talked about. At times I'd think ""While I was doing something fun somebody out there lost their life""... The atmosphere immediately kicked those thoughts back into gear. The first episode truly was creepy, un-nerving and 'real'.. Hats off to Peters for taking on a role like this.. After the episode finished I sat down and reviewed what was coming up.. We chose not to continue watching, Personally, I don't need to know beyond what I have already learned over the years of the times preceding the capture of the monster.. It was certainly a controversial character to play and he did it well."
9.0,28 October 2022,"Well first I wanna say thanks a lot for getting me now obsessed with everything and starting Jeffrey. This series really open the door to not only the horrible things of this man dead but also the families, friends and neighbors that were affected by it. I know that a lot of people are saying the show has humanized what he did however I think it actually brought new light to the people that were left behind. The series covered the stories of the families that fought to find out what happened and also gave some more exposure to the fact that he wanted to know why he was the way he was. Guess what he did was evil and horrible but he did understand it and I don't think anyone did either. Great series!"
9.0,1 October 2022,"Absolutely terryfing version of events. The lead gives a superb performance of this monster and sometimes even manages to have you feel sorry for this beast, admittedly not for long but proves what an amazing actor he is. Some scenes are difficult to watch but I for one could not look away. If I had to describe this as something other than chilling I would have to call this a sublime series that really captures the intensity of the nightmare that is Jeffrey Dahmer. I felt so sorry for both parents and his astute but intentionally ignorant grandmother. I think their love and fear of Jeffery is palpable at times and left me personally, anxious and angry but still wanting to see it through. A truly gruesome man portrayed immaculately. Well Done all involved."
10.0,3 October 2022,"Unbelievable acting and sensitive direction delivers an incredible account of this story. Deeply sad. Respectful. None of the gratuitous horror you see in equivalent programmes.

Interestingly, this story cultivates compassion where you didn't think you'd find it. A breadth of plot you won't have realised existed surrounding these circumstances.

Hard to recommend as you find with anything like this. Can I say it's a must see?! How can anyone recommend sharing this for entertainment sake when it's a true story. And yet if you are a fan of true crime, this is a must see to try and understand the story behind the headlines of the time."
1.0,27 September 2024,"The viewer is left to make their decision as to whether this was manslaughter or cold blooded murder. In my opinion the outcome is irrelevant as the perception of the defence and prosecution is made.

Ive seen more Rolex watches and Sergio Tacchini jackets in this drama than a day trip to Harrods

Some incredible performances! I will be shocked if i don't see some star performances from the cast follow in Javier Bardems footsteps in a blockbuster movie in due course.

A typical Netflix Documentary-series that is left drawn out and heavily desperate for content towards the finale.

The cheesy punchlines and glamorous cast ensure my precious time wasn't subject to a complete waste."
10.0,24 September 2022,"Holy hell this show is slow. We made it about half way through the second episode after suffering through the first. The end of the first episode gives you hope things are picking up but then it drags back to a snail's pace.

The acting seems good but whoever edited this shouldn't be allowed to edit anything ever again. The pacing is so off it just drags on and on.

This seems to be common with Netflix. Take an hour or two of content and stretch it out into several hours of episodes.

The Dahmer story has better adoptions. I'd recommend pretty much any or all of them over this agonizingly slow POS."
8.0,3 October 2022,"This is one of those shows that will stay in your mind even after it ends. In fact that's why I'm writing this at 1am, because I can't fall asleep. This was difficult to watch and often times I wanted to stop watching it and couldn't. Evan Peters is brilliant and his mostly calm demeanor is both compelling and chilling. You will feel like a fly on the wall watching everything go down over and over. You want to scream and shout out to save his victims and can't. The 14yr old and dead victim was pure torture to watch. This is the best Dahmer reproduction yet. Evan made this by far the best performance of the year in my book."
8.0,2 October 2022,"I liked the overall tone, felt more like an author film than a successful American TV producer's show. Almost no music or sound effect abuses, nice slow paced narrative, incredible photography, immersive acting. But please just stop watching once you finish episode six because that is the pinnacle of the story and after that it definitely can't hold.. Last 4 episodes say nothing, go nowhere... The show becomes frustrating in a not enjoyable way. It's a pity because before that and from episode one I loved the way you get to know Dahmer, the process involving that was both terrifying and awesome. It really builds up into a highly heartbreaking experience."
8.0,13 October 2022,"Absolutely nothing about this mini-series will make you feel good. It was a stark reminder that monsters live among us, and they look like everyday people. Regardless of your sexuality, this twisted series will make you truly ponder the dark side of the human soul.

Carl Franklin, Clement Virgo, Jennifer Lynch, Paris Barclay, and Gregg Araki were clearly the best directors for this project. They showed Dahmer for the monster he assuredly was. Writers Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, David McMillan, Janet Mock, Reilly Smith, and Todd Kubrak did not play the 'charming killer' card. They portrayed a horrific and twisted person whose story was equally controversial, relevant, and educational.

Great musical scoring by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis - minimal yet effective. Jason McCormick and John T. Connor performed amazing cinematography work - that colour palette was especially good. Set decoration, production design and sound effects were outstanding. Hair-makeup and stunts deserve a special shout-out. Rudy Mance's costume design was aces.

It couldn't have been easy to play this sick excuse for a person, but Evan Peters deserves a sustained round of applause, and several rounds of other stuff to help him forget about this phase of his career. My spine still tingles as I write about him. By playing Jeffrey Dahmer, Peters has definitively proven that no role is too dark for him. One more favourite actor, check.

Richard Jenkins was outstanding as Lionel Dahmer (the father). Shari Dahmer (the second wife), played by Molly Ringwald, was great. Joyce Dahmer (the first wife), played by Penelope Ann Miller, was exceptional. Early-days Lionel Dahmer, played by Josh Braaten, was notable. Early-days Joyce Dahmer, played by Savannah Brown, was superb. The kid version of Jeffrey Dahmer, played by Nick A. Fisher was captivating. Catherine Dahmer (the grandmother), played by Michael Learned, was excellent.

Glenda Cleveland (the neighbour), enacted by Niecy Nash, was brilliant. She brought a good deal of humanity to this series, and god knows it needed plenty of that. Tony Hughes, played by Rodney Burford, was memorable. Shirley Hughes, played by Karen Malina White, was amazing. Mayor John Norquist, played by Raphael Sbarge, was good. Reverend Jesse Jackson, played by Nigel Gibbs, was outstanding. Christopher Scarver, played by Furly Mac, was avenging-angel greatness.

Detective Murphy, played by Michael Beach, was good. And so was Detective Kennedy, played by Colby French. Tracy Edwards, played by Shaun J. Brown, was noteworthy. Ronald Flowers, played by Dyllon Burnside, was great. Somsack Sinthasomphone, played by Brayden Maniago, was quite good. John Wayne Gacy, played by Dominic Burgess, was a sickening revelation in his own right - a good performance from Burgess.

From Dahmer's high school flashbacks, Emma Kennedy as Denise was good. Chazz, played by Colin Ford, had good screen presence. I remember some of Ford's early movies, it was nice to see him on screen again. A rather under-rated performer, if you ask me. Both of them had very little screen time but stood out regardless. Steven (probably Dahmer's first murder victim), played by Cameron Cowperthwaite, was notable.

All other cast and crew were mad enough to be part of this production, and did great work. This unnerving mini-series is now streaming on Netflix.

Important note: It is only reasonable to avoid assuming the worst about LGBTQ+ people based on what you see in this show. One man's despicable actions should never, in all fairness, be used to judge an entire community.

A homosexual splanchnophiliac (one who finds internal organs sexually arousing) sounds like something concocted in a fever dream. However, a slew of news reports, police files, and court evidence have long declared such a monstrous man to be the real deal. Jeffrey Dahmer was a bona fide splanchnophiliac who later took his desire up a few notches and added cannibalism to the list. Regardless of his mental health, Dahmer's actions cannot (in my opinion) be considered human let alone deserving of forgiveness. Some people are just born monsters, I guess.

His actions were insufferable and reflected poorly on the LGBTQ+ community who had nothing to do with his way of thinking. Also, I believe a large part of his aptitude was based on upbringing, circumstances, and surroundings. Goes to show how impressionable the human mind can be, and how swiftly it can be consumed by its own dark inclinations.

The mini-series also bottled plenty of 90s vibes. Great attention to detail all round. They covered ten or so murders committed by this broken human. I especially liked how they spotlighted the sheer incompetence of Milwaukee's (Wisconsin, USA) then legal system and local police force, both of whom failed time and again to keep this animal behind bars. Not to forget the blind eye his own parents turned to his early 'symptoms' and, dare I say it, silent calls for help. His father later managed to spot the monster within his son, though a tad too late.

""Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" has established Ryan Murphy and Evan Peters as a creative duo to reckon with. Their work in this mini-series made me feel sick to my stomach but also impressed at how boldly they managed to capture the wanton cruelty of one man. They way Dahmer disarmed and then took advantage of his victims' helplessness... It was sexual predation, period. His pathological lying only added more fuel to the fire.

Get ready to have your heart shattered in episode 6. It was genuinely poignant and surprisingly darker than the other episodes. E07 contained some powerful moments worth appreciating. It balanced out the gruesomeness showcased in the previous episodes. Blame games and accountability also featured strongly in the later epis, and each scene in them was well-crafted.

What a show! And to know that every episode was based on a full-fledged real-as-heck human being and his deeply disturbing desires. Do NOT watch this series if you aren't ready to see some crazy s**t."
10.0,9 October 2022,"This was extremely extremely difficult to watch. I kept pausing every two seconds 'cause it was getting hard to breathe watching this. My stomach hurt so much throughout the entire show.

Before I started watching, my roommate told me a little about him & I made a joke saying, oh we're so alike, we both love the person for what's inside them. Well, I regretted ever even thinking that when I was watching the second episode.

Throughout the show, the thing I felt towards Dahmer wasn't hate, or anger, or love. It was partially disgust, partially pity, partially confusion, partially sadness and whole lot of being disturbed. Pity, because, his childhood seemed so familiar. Although, I would still say it was much much much much better than mine. Watching this series made me scared I'd end up like him. Hopefully not, I have more than enough friends thank god. Loneliness does make you extremely weird to the world tho, who else would know better than me.

I loved that this series showed all the sides, everyone's perspective. My heart hurt so much for Tony. He deserved better, that was so confusing for me."
10.0,30 September 2022,This is less about the unbelievable drama unfolding in front of your eyes but the acting by Evan peters. I had never heard of this actor before but his performance here is up there as one of the best acting performances i've ever seen. His character is evil but his presence on screen gives you this excitement and joy which stays in your mind long after the credits stop rolling. As sick and twisted the crimes are you are left wanting more than the 10 episodes you are given. Netflix have done it again with this series as i feel most company's wouldn't have the balls to air it. Brilliant and hopefully we get more of these.
3.0,18 June 2024,"In my experience, media produced by Netflix, Amazon, or Apple tend to be poorly made and just a waste of time. This is first thing I've seen where it was pretty well done. The approach is very slow and methodical and takes its time exploring the history of Jeff, his family, friends, and those around him. It's not a linear timeline, which somewhat works, though not entirely necessary, as they could've made it entirely chronologically and it would've still been interesting. The actors portraying Jeff, Lionel, and Glenda did a terrific job, and you feel like you're watching those people in real life instead of a story. Evan Peters did a great job creating a creepy, lonely, repressed, and vulnerable Dahmer. The actress for Jeff's mother did a mediocre job, and it felt very artificial, forced, and like you were watching a performance. The show did a great job exploring the situation from all sides. Being a watcher of true crime, I've seen all too often the killer being vilified in absolute terms, as an evil that should be punished at all cost without any context of their background and upbringing. Having a dysfunctional home, being exposed to gore and macabre things during the formative years, and having a lack of love, empathy, and structure in the house are common hallmarks of serial killer childhoods. Dahmer was no exception, and portraying that side of him in a fair way instead of simply casting him as pure evil without reason was a nice thing. Then you also see it from the perspective of the people around him, like Lionel and Glenda, and you can see some of the social and environmental repercussions of Jeff's actions and history. Touching on the shortcomings of the justice system was good, and was definitely a contributing factor in his extended killing spree. I do think Jeff was aware of that during that time period, and used it to his advantage. Some of the dialogue exploring redemption near the last few episodes were great and captivating. Overall, a great series that was methodically done, had great pacing, great acting, and a well-rounded portrayal of Dahmer, his history, and the aftermath."
9.0,30 September 2022,"Absolutely disgraceful. I expect nothing less from a Netflix original at this point in time. How dare these people take the victims of Jeffrey Dahmer and shove it through a lens of 2020's racial politics. Take a moment and look up the things that don't seem realistic and you'll find that most of the situations that occur never happened. The writers and directors of this should be ashamed of themselves and hope one day they will. They had a wonderful and brilliant cast and they flushed it down their narrative forming toilet. There are some points where It's almost jarring and you don't even know what you are watching anymore because it's not even about Jeffrey Dahmer or the horrendous murders that occurred and we are honed in on Jesse Jackson giving a passionate speech about fighting the good fight. +2 stars for the actor that played Jeffrey Dahmer, he's brilliant. -8 stars for trying to take me to civil rights class in the process. Disgraceful."
10.0,30 September 2022,"This is a brilliant show in terms of overall stylistics, imagery, cinematography, and acting. However, it makes you feel uneasy. I had to watch it over a period of several weeks to finish, even though the show was interesting and engaging. Many reviewers admitted that it is disturbing, and I have to agree. Yet, this show is disturbing. The creators make you an accomplice by telling half of the story from Dahmer's perspective. You cannot sympathize with him at any point in his life, not even in childhood. I think it was the main point, though. Dahmer is a monster, and there is no explanation for his deviations and compulsions.

Two downsides for me were the length of the show and Glenda's character. It had to be 5-6 episodes long. The last two episodes were unnecessary. Glenda is unprecedentedly annoying with her obsession with Dahmer.

Oh, and of course, Evan Peters is a genius. He is particularly unsettling here. I knew he was a fantastic actor after watching American Horror Story. Yet, this role tops everything he has done so far."
10.0,13 October 2022,
8.0,2 April 2024,"I have to say that ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" seems like a very interesting Netflix miniseries. It tries to shift the focus from the notorious serial killer himself to the victims, which is a refreshing perspective. I've heard that Evan Peters delivers a haunting performance as Dahmer, and the supporting cast is also quite talented. The series blends elements of crime drama and psychological thriller, and the directorial style is characterized by long, tense scenes. Critics have praised the series for its performances and its commitment to highlighting the victims' stories, but some have also noted that it can feel repetitive and may not offer new insights to those already familiar with the case. Overall, I'm intrigued by the series and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys true-crime stories. But I was scared to watch it."
9.0,12 October 2022,"It has been over 30 years since the Incarceration of The Milwaukee Cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer, The horrific Story of this man's horrific story is brought to Life through the eyes and ears of Emmy Award Winning Director Ryan Murphy, I knew after watching the Trailer, the Gruesome Nightmare Fueled depiction that was about to be released, After watching this gruesome Documentary series, I couldn't help but to question how painful and traumatizing it was for the victims of the families this devil had done to their children, Evans is brilliant, the Attention to detail, remarkable acting, costume designs, location sets, the ability to put his mindset to that of what Dahmers was must have taken a great deal of strong mental capability, The first victim Tracy Edwards was a straight mind blowing horror nightmare experience a creepy setting and a taste of the many grotesque things to come, The inticement and grooming mechanism of a promise of paying him $50 for photographs, leading to his apartment from Hell, this man isn't Freddy nor Jason not even Michael Myers, HE IS REAL!

The lack of police help and the dismissal of witness statements was sickening and frustrating in the sense that the injustice of the fellow African-American community allow Dahmer to continue with his heinous crime spree,

This documentary was well preserved and kept to an advantage that it does indeed capture the persona and overall living Nightmare of who Jeffrey Dahmer, A messed up and sick minded individual who later suffered the consequences of his dire and disgusting crime spree he swept across the Milwaukee state and destroyed the lives of the victims families, Please take caution whilst watching this Documentary, it is not for everyone to see, It will shock you!"
9.0,7 October 2022,"Holy c*ap!....:What an incredible series.

This is not an easy watch by any means. It is captivating and enthralling in equal parts. It's so difficult to understand how someone could be so twisted and damaged but this ten parter achieves this brilliantly, terrifying and equally compelling at the same time. This series sucks you in and doesn't easily let go. I found myself being haunted by some images and scenes and it's difficult to not think about it afterwards. Amazing soundtrack, cinematography and acting makes this an stunning piece of television. Horrific and difficult, important and enthralling. Wow, wow, wtf!!!."
10.0,8 October 2022,
9.0,24 September 2022,"First of all, I have to give credit where credit is due. Richard Jenkins delivered a fantastic performance (as usual) playing Dahmer's father. I like most of Jenkins' movies but here he shines as the guilt stricken father of the infamous serial killer. Without Jenkins however, this series would be unwatchable. Evan Peters also delivers a great performance as Dahmer. Now that that's out of the way, I'll get into the problems with the series which is the writing and the extreme and dishonest levels of ""artistic liberty"" the writer, director, and producers take on telling the story. In a nutshell, they took a true story and used it to push a very ""special"" narrative. We've seen this before, the police are a bunch of, well you know what they are. It's gotten so bad I don't even need to say it. And I don't wish to be hunted down by Biden's DoJ for posting a review. Also, the character who plays Glenda is almost more unlikable than Dahmer himself. She is his neighbor and for some reason half of the series is about her. My very first impression of her was positive but that quickly changes as she does nothing but scream and yell and complain about everything under the Sun. As for the ""artistic liberty"", if you watch this series, and I advise you not waste your time, just try to think outside of what your being fed. Anyone with a critical thinking mind will see this piece of pure trash for what it is; propaganda."
8.0,21 September 2024,"I feel like his shows show the real ways of the world unfiltered every time .

These producers are the voice of the people .

Both Installments of Monster have been gripping , excellent acting , such brilliance in character choices and story telling .

I wish IMDb did not make me write 600 words . LOL

Watch anytime with Ryan Murphy name on it . I'm always in Awh as I never choose his shows based on name but am always aghast each time when I realize I say yes of course Ryan Murphy , how did I not know .

The props are also perfect takes you right back to the time and space in which the events occur ."
10.0,22 September 2022,"A great show but severely needed editing down, I finished the 5th episode and could not understand how there were 5 left, and then when I finished the 9th episode I really couldn't fathom why there was a 10th when everything already felt wrapped up.

That being said the acting from everyone is really quite great, the show looks good, sounds good (apart from dahmers accent) and the story itself has a follows an interesting timeline.

Episode 6 Silenced is by far my favourite, the actor for Tony is great and I felt so tense the entire episode, even pausing halfway because I just didn't want things to escalate the way you predict them to.

Overall 7.3/10."
9.0,3 October 2022,
9.0,29 September 2022,"So of course I had heard of Jeff Dahmer, but I didn't know the full extent of his crimes. As a gay man myself it hit quite close to home and the nature of the crimes was disturbing. But the most disturbing of all was the underlying homophobia and racism which allowed this monster to keep killing over such a period of time.

Shining light amongst all the horror is Niecy Nash's portrayal of Glenda. What a better world we would be living in if everyone was a Glenda. Long time fan of Nash and I hope she gets the recognition she deserves for this role!

Negative would be that ten episodes felt a bit like overkill. Could've been done in 6-8. But loved the highlighting of the victims stories and their families."
1.0,4 October 2022,"Horrifying adaptation of the real-life Jeffrey Dahmer story told through the vivid lives of the victims, their families and those who were impacted by his heinous crimes.

While Evan Peters gets all the praise, and he was fantastic, I cannot review this series without talking about Niecy Nash's standout performance as Glenda Jackson, Dahmer's neighbour, who continuously raised the alarm with police and gets ignored. Nash offers a maternal comfort to viewers and shines as the feminine strength of the series. Bravo! I hope Netflix do not forget her when submitting nominations to the awards circuit."
9.0,27 September 2022,"Anything Dahmer-related conjures feelings of horror, shock, repulsion. The less you think about it, the better it is for your well-being. I am one of many who roll their eyes with a big sigh, ""Why another TV show on this subject? No one needs to see that!"" And then I learn that this new series is another creation of Ryan Murphy starring Evan Peters. Immediately my interest is piqued as I am a huge fan of both. I decide to watch the show for Murphy and Peters' talents, not for partaking in the glorification of a non-fiction deranged cannibal.

""Dahmer - Monster"" is so well-made that you can smell the stench oozing off the screen. The pace is purposely slow to instill dread in you as if you are one of the victims, and it is highly effective at that. Props go to the production team (especially the writers, directors, editors) for creating such an eerie ambience. And the top kudos goes to Evan Peters himself. His portrayal is what makes this series. I expect him to be good, but not this good. It is quite mind-blowing. On par with Peters' esteemed acting performance is Richard Jenkins' depiction of the father. Jenkins is the perfect casting choice. Every awkward and uncomfortable nuance is spot on yet unpredictable. It is as if you are watching Jenkins' genuine discomfort about the show, period.

While the first half of the series showcases the creators' knack for turning gross and creepy into something that you cannot look away from, the second half delves into the educational, which offers some redeeming value and justification for developing this series. We learn and remember the names of the victims. We feel the pain of the families. And we learn that being a serial killer is not a white thing (as 82% of American serial killers are white), but rather that brown or black would-be serial killers typically are not afforded the chance to serial-kill as they would just get caught!"
10.0,28 September 2024,
9.0,21 September 2022,"This is amazing. From episode one you are hooked. I was not expecting the way it was filmed in terms of timeline / cinematography but the choices were really good.

Evan peters outstanding. He really makes you hate him even more than you already did.

This show gives a real insight into the psychology and backstory of one of the worst serial killers ever. It also reminds me a bit of mind hunters from Netflix in terms of how the story unravels.

As a fan of crime documentaries I thought I knew what there was to know about this story but there is so much more that gets spoken about and highlighted. A must watch."
10.0,26 September 2022,"The acting is incredibly captivating, a take on the truth of how the monster (Jeff Dahmer) murdered and tortured the innocent men he met. Quite shocking in many places but without unnecessary gore. A serial killer with evil intent who came to meet his fate at the very end of his sick and twisted actions.

Evan Peters is absolutely brilliant in this take on Jeffrey Dahmer, if you liked the Ted Bundy tapes and the film about him then you'll enjoy this limited series consisting of 10 hour long episodes.

Gripping, so much that I binge watched the whole limited series in two days. Acting is excellent throughout."
8.0,24 September 2022,
10.0,8 December 2022,
1.0,27 September 2022,"Impressive series, which not only seeks to portray how a human being becomes a monster, but how the ineptitude and racism of the police allowed Dahmer to continue committing aberrant crimes. It's full of messages about family relationships and is grotesquely disgusting at times. It is understandable why Netflix did not promote it, those who like the genre will arrive on their own to this brutual piece. You can't empathize with the character when Netflix blows your mind with Jeffrey's atrocities, so you quickly get out of there. Dahmer manages to reach the last level of horror, disgusto. Brutal."
9.0,30 September 2022,"This movie was excellent on so many levels.

As I first started watching it, the most obvious thing is ""Wow, Even Peters"" is a really great actor. I have always like him for his work on the American Horror Story/ies but his talent was taken to a new level here. He plays a person with a dark secret to perfection and his ability to be flat-out scary surprised me because I thought he was already pretty excellent at it. If nothing else, watch the series for his acting.

While I was watching the series I kept looking up things for their accuracy and apparently it was pretty accurate. Of course there were lots of assumptions made about the interaction between Dahmer and most of his victims but the backdrop around his evolution, depravity, and capture were very close to what actually happened. That sense of authenticity was pretty refreshing.

Probably the biggest thing I appreciated was that the movie focused more on the character Dahmer than the arrest, prosecution, etc. Too many crime movies turn into courtroom drama that is derivative and repetitive and Dahmer was able to avoid falling into those traps which made the story that much more compelling.

It's gets knocked down one star for being really slow at some points. Maybe that was intentional to set the tone but there were a couple of points early in the series where I wanted to turn it off and come back to it later because I wasn't able to keep attention. Once the hook was set in my mind about the end of episode 2, that didn't happen anymore."
10.0,4 October 2022,"It took me 4 days to finish the series as it was too much for me. There wasnt that much gore and blood but boy they did a good job. The apartment was similar to the original oxford apartments and even the lawyers office and court room scenes were exactly like the original videos. Peters did an amazing job in picking up dahmer's manners. The show is true to the facts and even small details are mentioned in the series. However, i do not understand the harsh criticism? I mean its not the first time someone has created a movie on Dahmer's life story? Its not the first time Hollywood has created something based on a true crime, There are so many series that openly romanticize killers, I do feel for the family of the victims I hope Netflix will give them some amount because in the end, its their story and tragedy not Dahmer's. The series focused on important issues like racism and gave us glimpse of the lives of the victims. I really liked the actor who played Lionel Dahmer, he did a good job and i didnt know the story of dahmer's father and was shocked to know how much he tried to help jeff."
10.0,2 October 2022,"... surpass the expactation.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not fan of this guy, just always been an enthusiast of the study of killer minds.

This piece, even giving a little of sentimentalistic perspective to Dahmer's actions (thats what provoques the 9), portraits so well and so painfully the tragedies, that puts you on constant anxiety.

The claustrofobic atmosphere represented trought the apartament, trought the noise of the drill and the imaginary smell, causes a permanent feeling of dangerous, of repulse.

Applause to Evan, Niecy and Richard for the acting and for putting in each very single detail the real characters essence.

Great show.

The memory of the victims lives in me."
10.0,18 November 2022,
8.0,25 September 2022,"The entire series gives you goosebumps, the acting is insanely good. The casting choice was also amazing.

Niecy Nash and Evan Peters' acting was very realistic, it felt as if I was there when everything was happening because of how realistically they portrayed everything.

It was a bit hard to watch if I'm being honest, it was eerie and disturbing especially when you consider the fact that this actually happened in real life and everything is factual, that just makes it scarier. Ryan Murphy truly made this the best biography of all time, it's realistic, thrilling, ominous, and creepy.

I recommend this."
10.0,4 October 2022,"Dahmer is one of the better adaptations I've seen regarding a serial killer/true crime story. The way the story unfolds is often unsettling and unlike fiction, there are no positive character turns and the story just tells the atrocities of an entitled killer and the horrible things he did to so man people and their families. Dahmer does a great job and giving a very rounded view on how crimes like this effect society at large and how people like Dahmer should not be idolized. The show never tries to make him some sympathetic person that is just misunderstood. It lets him be the thing he was and that, unflinching in it's execution."
1.0,7 October 2022,"Ok so yes this is utterly disturbing, horrifying and enthralling at the same time.

It's very uncomfortable to watch but somehow I couldn't turn it off.

I put that down to Evan Peters, who is literally the master of the screen in this series.

That man deserves every award for his outstanding performance.

Also Niecy Nash, that lady is fierce as the formidable Glenda. More awards going her way I hope. The anguish the anger and hopelessness that she portrayed in this series.... Wow! She was incredible.

I do think it was done as sensitively as possible for the families, and learning of his back story really made me think about what it takes to Amal's someone this way."
10.0,21 September 2024,"This was a blatant disrespect to the victims. The brothers didn't use an abuse excuse and to insinuate this was incredibly disrespectful and disgusting. These boys went through so much that they even said in court that they didn't believe that boys could be sexual abuse victims, and this is why they were tried much differently than what they would've been tried today. So for you to insinuate that they were using the abuse excuse to get off is honestly just pathetic and disgusting, these poor boys have been horrible, but people are serving sentences for doing a lot less and people weren't abused."
10.0,22 September 2022,"This show exceeded my expectations. It Stands Tall amongst all other true crime content on Netflix and other streaming services these days. Evan Peters is amazing as always but he really brings it in this series. Showing the Insanity and also the struggle of Dahmer, and will make you both disgusted with him and empathetic at the same time. It's amazing how long He got away with his crimes and I believe he really didn't care if he got caught or not which is especially scary. You gotta feel bad for the families of the victims and also Dahmer's family. The vibe of the show is incredibly dark but hard to stop watching. 9 stars !"
10.0,22 September 2024,"I guess the only questionable inaccuracy is boys incest claim, besides that everything is so accurate. Do your research people! Watch the tapes, the whole tribunal scenes are all in the tapes, word by word. The evidences, the side characters stories, all very true and documented.

Every single actor delivers an exemplary acting! Eric actor in particularly really captured the essence of the real life actor, even his quietness, lost boy eye look is exactly the real life Eric. You can see a lot of attention to detail applied into his performance.

This should have been it's own limited series, it's not in the same category as the first season for sure. Different worlds."
10.0,15 November 2022,"Great story. Minus a point because it uses language that is very... 2022 for scenes that happened in 1991. Some of the detective stuff was retconned from real life. I also wish they'd actually included some of the necrophelia that Dahmer engaged in rather than just talking about it.

Other than that, the story is accurate and engaging. The script seems to draw most heavily on the books Grilling Dahmer by Detective Patrick Kennedy and A Father's Story by Lionel Dahmer.

In this light, it was more of a psychological/detective story than pure horror.

People have criticized Netflix for releasing this series and not compensating the victims families. But it was a fascinating story worth telling."
9.0,30 September 2022,"This series is one for the ages with compelling performances. From the first episode you will be blown away from this story but once you settle in, the performances will start rising to the top. Award worthy acting by a few people in this one. Notably, of course, Evan Peters. He explodes well past his other roles like a quicksilver (pun intended) in his portrayal of Dahmer. An unforgettable performance that will stick with you long before you finish watching. (If you dare.. lol) also award worthy, Niecy Nash. Her role as ""the neighbor"" and all she went through was so well done that you actually feel it as you watch. Don't want to give details but a must match!! You have to see it for yourself. She shines here. Another performance that deserves recognition was the roller coaster ride Richard Jenkins puts you through as Dahmer's father. He takes us through a range of emotions from angry to sad from sympathy to culpable all in a drop of a hat from episode to episode. Noteworthy are Penelope Ann Miller as the mom & Molly Ringwald as the stepmom, both are stellar here. I've already gone longer then I wanted but must give a shout out to Ryan Murphy, Ian Brennan, and all the directors involved for a series that will shoot up on everyone's one of the best series of all time list. They tell everyone's side and how all the failures made, by family and society, possibly, could have made things different if better decisions were made. Difficult and tough watch for some, to know things like this go on in this world of ours. But yet, so we'll done and so well performed it is well worth it. Highly recommend."
9.0,9 October 2022,
4.0,23 September 2022,"As one has come to expect, this Ryan Murphy production continues to grow his amazing stable of cinema treats.

It takes a brilliant writer to explore the character of 'a monster' that, whilst a horrifying psychopath, was also human. A human beyond redemption. Its aim isn't perhaps to show sympathy or even empathy for the nightmare that was Jeffrey Dahmer, but more to include his history, not as an explanation of that, but as allowing the audience to look in horror and wonder how and why this happened. There is more than one monster here. The Police involved made some major mis-steps that could easily have prevented many murders at the hands of this damaged, psychotic individual. The blood of at least one victim lays clearly on their hands.

The pace suits the material perfectly and the viewer may well be surprised at where in the Dahmer story this series begins. At first I thought , 'No, they're not!', but they did. And it's a brave choice by the two writers.

All the production values here are top notch, particularly the acting but the scriptwriting is where all the value comes from. It's a corker, taking a story and making it more than simply engaging...it's riveting."
10.0,25 September 2022,"Like most ""true crime"" this is appalling. This is literally a cash grab at the expense of retraumatizing the families of the victims. They did not consent to the making of this series. Yes, netflix doesn't legally need consent from them, but from a moral standpoint, they should have. Some of the families are considering lawsuits against this series. This is not speculation.

These tragedies are NOT entertainment. And if you view it as entertainment, you have no sympathy for the families. Watch some thing else that is fictional and has no real victims. This should have not been made. Do not watch this as you will be contributing to the commodification."

Episode 6 really got me. What an evil man he was and the horrible things that happened to these young men. It was infuriating to watch the lack of law enforcement taking Glenda's claims seriously. That poor 14 year old boy, his family. Screaming at the TV for sure!!!

Evan Peters played this amazingly. Definitely creeped me out! I hope he has overcome playing this monster. I had nightmares from watching this show. I can't imagine having to play this character for a long period of time. It's such a dark story.

Highly recommend!"
8.0,28 September 2022,"Really good re enactment. Throughout the series you are almost glued to the screen. Usually for serial killers a documentary is made to re account the events. This goes above and beyond and actually brings the story to real life. As much as some of the scenes were disturbing by all means, I enjoyed the presentation because of how entrapping it was. Excellent job Netflix. I think the world felt this was unique and that the acting was phenomenal. Even the eery colors in the apartment even created a creepy yet ominous affect. It was sad and horrifying what happened to Jeff Dahmers victims and I wish the families of these guys lots of prayers and sympathy."

2.0,28 September 2022,"This miniserie is something else. The first scene already got my adrenaline pumping. The acting is beyond great, Ryan Murphy only had one rule for the Dahmer character, which is not to make the viewers empathize with him. He for sure did a great job at that. You kinda feel helpless watching all those young men fall for his tricks as they step inside his house/room.

The timelines are mixed up and it made me confused at some points. Not a serie to watch as a background thing, but it needs your attention and i couldn't keep my eyes of the screen.

It was quite okay with first episode,I thought Its gonna take its pace after a while. But I didnt guess that right, my bad! The story just revolves around unnecessarily elongated exaggerated scenes which is surely enough to cause headache to anyone watching.

The high ratings here have failed to keep their standard this time. I cant believe what got into these people to rate it that high. It must be Evan Peter playing this role. Well, no comments on his acting, but Sorry to say I got BORED.

8.0,27 September 2022,"I'll start out saying I've researched / followed this case, and updates, for several years due to its complexities that impacte so many people...and wow, I was surprised by how it affected me.

First off, the casting was brilliant and coupled with amazing writing its a disturbing gem that conveys how dark a person's mind can become over several years. It begs the question is it ""nature vs nurture""? I don't think there will be a definitive answer but at least this gives a perspective for all the victims, living or deceased, and the damage left in the aftermath.

It's a heartbreaking story that highlights horrific and deplorable behavior exacted by people who should be trusted.

Whether it's parents, friends or the judicial system so many times those individuals failed to listen and accept it at for what it clearly was. A disturbed predator taking advantage of the situation simply because he could.

I don't get overly emotional watching or listening to documentaries but this one had me bawling from E6 till the end.

A hard watch but so worth it."
9.0,25 September 2022,"I love how this series are made . I love how they have shown Jeff Dahmer like everyone knows him in first episode but after that shows why he was the well known Dahmer . I also like how they have shown the difference between him and Bundy or Gacy . Evan Peters was Amazing and Richard Jenkins is always superb , overall I think the most gruesome episode was the first one and if you can pass that yes it still has horrible stuff but it shows the reasons for them as well and with Dahmer I really think that he wouldn't be Dahmer if his parents ever looked at him and helped his sick mind that with right medication and professional help may not exploded like that."
10.0,22 September 2022,"Evan Peters is mesmerising!!!!!! The way he becomes Jeffrey Dahmer is amazing!!!!! I love his acting!!! All you can see is Jeffrey!!!

And the way it takes you into the "" rabbits hole "" is breathtaking!!!

It's both excited and upsetting at the same time !!!!

Food for thinking !!!!!

I only wish that they make more of this kind of serial killers series!!!

It's "" killing it "" On point!!!!

And for the closure......

Don't forget that caring for others and what's is "" just "" and "" fair "" is the noble thing one can do .

Sometimes it can save lives!!!!

I can't wait to see what's next for Evan Peters!!!!"

Its sad people had to face such henious things its well explained that how can we stop such thinking or how can we get alarmed if anything is happening suspicious around us coming to the series excellent work done by peter from direction to acting to creating that kind of shivering in the audience is remarkable Pls do watch but dont take any negative serial killing aspect from this I would say all the characters dis their job quite well Lastly god do forgives but sometimes take vengeance too Do watch out on your actions!!"
9.0,25 October 2022,"Yeah, this is about a monster, but it's the MOVIE that's a monster! The pace is slower than molasses. You can read a book while watching this show. Granted, some parts are good and will hold your attention, but those parts are few and far between. Why? It's like the movie is masturbating while the guy in the movie is masturbating. I mean, really! This show needs to get over itself. You will recognize this habit of Netflix movies to go on and on and on about some trivial matter just so they can make you watch more of their inane footage and hopefully make a few more bucks. Yeah, I'm being negative! So what? I've just lost way too much time to Netflix insanity to pack a punch. How did so many people take those so highly?! They must have been ""attracted"" to the show's theme. Personally, i find the Dahmer story very interesting, but this movie was DOA. I was bored to death the whole time."
9.0,29 September 2022,"The explanation of nature vs nurture was just so perfectly portrayed here. And Evan Peters nailed it!

The gun can be loaded (based on our genetic factors) but healthy parenting and a nurturing environment can literally keep that trigger from being pulled. And if behaviors do arise we are able to intervene at an earlier point which creates a better overall society.

Dahmer's crimes were particularly gruesome, involving cannibalism and necrophilia.

This particular series played things pretty faithfully to the reported information. The families' testimonies are nearly word-for-word from court transcripts, and they're the most effective part of the show."
8.0,4 October 2022,"I'm sure everyone knows about Jeffery Dahmer! This series though definitely takes you on a detailed look at what made Dahmer tick, his childhood including upbringing, parents, feelings and thoughts. It really opens up a new look that has never been told before in school or any other Dahmer movie. I've never heard of Evan Peters before this but he will definitely be a household name from here on out. Acting all around was impeccable. Niece Nash is nothing short of superb. Give you serial killer mentality vibes. 10 episodes is just enough. Not too long but not too short. Really good outstanding tv series filled with hella information I guarantee you've never known about Jeff."
8.0,28 September 2022,"This storyline has calmness, stillness. You can feel that this story has rightful amount of horror which you can only imagine and don't want to go in that situation. At times it feels like what as a citizen you can do at that point of time. Special mention to the Evan peters acting. I mean, you can literally see how maniac he acted out, but with a subtle attitude, he only shouts 3-4 times and one scene where he offers sandwich is really choked me to my heart. These special scenes what makes a tv series very special.

But in the end it's more about the the society and homophobia in many people what this story succeeded to address."
10.0,5 October 2022,"This is a very well done series, great sets, great acting. Quite a few changes from the factual story, but they make it work. They lead is great, he really gets across Dahmers strangeness well and definitely paints an accurate picture of a creepy weirdo. The rest of the actors do quite well, with what they're given.

Now the bad. There is a lot of inaccurate portrails of law enforcement. Especially the award scene. Didn't happen.

The language used on many occasions did not fit the time period, no one in the 70s said anything ridiculous like ""my truth"".

But the worst part, and I've heard it from a few others as well, is that the series creates sympathy for Dahmer. I felt like I was cheering for him at quite a few points in the show. I don't think enough emphasis was put on how brutal his crimes were, a lot of stuff wasn't shown but implied, which would push the viewer away from sympathizing with him. Tbh I found the sexual stuff far more disturbing than the murders.

But overall it is very good, despite the terrible subject matter."
10.0,22 September 2022,"Evan Peters is simply outstanding in this, in fact the whole cast are amazing! This is not slow, it's telling the story from all sides. Don't watch if you're into watching murders!!! This is a character driven series. Mr Peters has immersed himself completely and it's paid off, awards please! This obviously is about Dahmer but for once, victims, their families, the impact , devastation on all of them. A racist, homophobic police force (as today), useless as well as a court system which is and was broken. It is creepy, scary and so sad. It will move you, I was completely in and watched in two evenings! Complete package. More like this please Netflix."
1.0,28 September 2022,"As disturbing as it might be, the story itself, the director did an amazing job at creating this series, sometimes a genius - so good it is. How the story unfolds, how it keeps some secrets and how it gets back to it, how it manages to tell the whole story but on parts, how every character is able to tell its story, at some point...brilliant.

The acting itself is really great as well, the main character is brilliant.

I am not a fan of these kind of series, but this one I couldn't miss, and I could tell just by watching the first episode - it is one of the best series ever made, and I see others agree as well."
10.0,9 October 2024,
9.0,28 September 2022,"After the last few shows of Netflix I thought maybe this one will also be bad.

I Was suprised big time by this series.

Roughly every episode give you a Story from the victim's point of view. There is a lot more victims to this multiple murder case than you may think (not only the murdered victims), but also the neighbours, the families and local socities.

The acting of the lead charcters is beyond everything ive seen in a while, and evan peters's is on top of them all. Oscar is needed here! The mimics. The reactions, the walk. The thinking. The rage.

The scenes and script is well made.

If you liked Mindhunter - you will surely love this!

Well played Netflix.... Well played."

10.0,7 October 2022,"Wow - I had no idea what I was getting into with this one. Dahmer is well written with haunting visuals and great acting. Especially the main performance as Dahmer. This show deals with issues such as neglect, suppression, mental illness, and alcoholism. (And yes, murder and cannibalism.).

Really, this show is addicting right from the start and pulls you into a macabre world of one of the United States most prolific and worst serial killers. Someone whose actions are so deranged, they defy explanation. But this show attempts, and to an extent does a really solid job, of deep diving into his psychology and family life and tries to shed some light into how all of these terrible murders happened.

Also, this show does a solid job of showing how vulnerable the community he victimized was and how much love and heart and hope was there that he preyed on, and how the police had so many opportunities to get Dahmer off the streets and they failed to do their jobs responsibly. Especially of note is Episode 6 which tells the story of one of Dahmer's victims who moved to Milwaukee to search for love and a modeling career and trusted Dahmer. It's powerful TV that breaks your heart and makes you question your perception of humanity.

Really, Dahmer is more than just a show about the code of a psychopath....but it's a show about what happens when parent figures (including The State) fail to protect the most vulnerable among us. Dahmer is a child looking for the companionship je never got from his family or friends, who battles to repress and eventually cave into his demons with catastrophic results.

This show deserves to be top 9 most watched in Netflix history. It's excellent."
10.0,12 October 2022,"The show is obviously uneasy to watch due to extremely violent nature of the narrative, but it is brilliantly executed, well played and raises important questions (as it should have been).

Such shows are needed, cause people should be aware, careful and pay more attention to what is happening around them. In general, ignorance (that of his parents, the police, most neighbors, etc.) is portrayed as the most tragic aspect of whole Dahmer's story and the authors presented it very well in the show.

Actors did a solid job as well, especially the main antagonist, the actor who played Lionel Dahmer, and the guy who played the deaf boy."
2.0,12 October 2022,"I'm quite a big fan of crime documentaries and I've watched most of the ones available about the most prolific serial killers of the past. The only one I've never really read or seen much about is Jeffrey Dahmer so I went into this series knowing his name but not really knowing what his crimes were. I took the opportunity to google before watching to familiarise myself with his crimes and what happened to him and I also looked for a quick interview featuring Dahmer himself to see how he was as a person in terms of how we spoke and his mannerisms.

I've been a fan of Evan Peters ever since he was in the X-Men films. His transformation through the American Horror Story series was fantastic and he really can turn his hand to any kind of character. He can make you hate him, he can make you feel sorry for him... He really is quite a talent. Now there are obvious similarities between him and Dahmer in terms of looks and this was further Magnified by him having the same hairstyle and colour and the large framed glasses that Dahmer was but it wasn't only a physical aspect. He also has taken a lot of time to evidently study Dahmer and really got into how he carried himself, presented himself, his awkward and seemingly shy demeanour and even how his mouth moved when he spoke. There were times when I was watching this that I completely forgot I was actually watching an actor and it was like I was watching Dahmer himself.

By the end of the first episode I was hooked although it surprised me initially that there were 10 episodes because I didn't wanna watch anything that seemed to glorify Dahmer or his crimes. However after finishing the series I see why there were as many episodes is there was and they were actually quite important because they took the time to tell the story from those who were affected by Dahmers crimes instead Pudding focus on him and glorifying him.

Probably the most poignant episode for me was the story of Tony Hughes. This followed his diagnosis as deaf shortly after birth due to medication and followed his career dreams and aspirations which made the pain of him being killed all the Morrill. The series also took the time to look at the effect it had on those in the community, how people rallied after he was exposed, the trauma his next door neighbour went through in tirelessly trying to bring him to justice... It really took the time to explore all avenues without really focusing too much on the crimes. Yes they are included and yes they are graphic and horrible but they are important to the series and the storyline.

The only episode I struggled with was the last episode when Dahmer has been caught in charge for his crimes and in prison. Whilst initially appearing arrogant, he discovers God and wishes to be baptised. Just as he seems at peace with who he is and seemingly getting his head back on track, he was murdered by a fellow inmate that was disgusted by his actions and felt that he was a vessel for God's well. The problem with the episode was that although it was done really well, it ended up staring at feelings for me where I almost pity Dharma. I don't know whether I pity Danny as a person or whether I pitied Evan Peters version but I felt uncomfortable with the fact that I was feeling pity for such a prolific murderer. It really does make you question.

It really does also highlight the horrific racism, segregation and poor efforts of the police and raises serious questions as to why Dahmer was not given support he needed before and why it wasn't picked up. There was a real sense of white privilege afforded to Jeffrey. Whilst I don't think his crimes were particularly racially motivated, there was definite racial profiling on the sides of the police officers dealing with the case.

Aside from that it's a really good series. It's hard hitting and even though I'm a lover of guts and gore films, knowing this is based on what really happened and how people really suffered, it can be a bitter pill to swallow. However I think it's done very well without giving any clarification or attention to dharma but instead given the chance for his victims stories to be told and their lives remembered.

Evan Peters absolutely shines in this and I can only imagine how hard it was to dive into the psyche of such a troubled serial killer."
10.0,8 October 2022,"Netflix delivers a series that works very well but completely neglects the real-world effects of its existence. By not contacting the.victims' relatives, Netflix had them relive this story all over again, just for attention. Very dissappointing. Makes me think about whether anyone on top thought about this at all and decided, we prefer money over the victims' relatives, or that they haven't thought about any of the side effects at all.

I hope this will not set a precedent for more productinos that release content without thinking about what its existence means. The release of this series is in conflict with the message of the show. Dahmer is a villain, but Netflix is profiting of his victims."
9.0,24 September 2024,
10.0,27 September 2022,"I'm still trying to shake the heaviness this show left with me after binging it over two nights. Evan Peters was outstanding, as he is in all of his roles. I was familiar with Dahmer's background and timeline. I think that made for a more interesting watch.

The best thing this series achieved which sets it apart from other horror-dramas based on serial killers is respecting the victims through personification and humanisation. In this series, Dahmer's victims (including Dahmer's neighbour, Glenda) have there time as temporary protagonists which gives us a window into their lives and how they were destroyed by Dahmer. The series also does a fantastic job at demonstrating events in Dahmer's life that precipitated his crimes, without trying to rationalise them or create room for sympathy or empathy.

The only reason is didn't give this show 10 stars is that the pacing with jumping between time points is a bit off at times.

Highly recommend."
8.0,15 March 2023,"I would said that the show was decent overall.

First of all 10 episode of 50+ minutes is way to long to tell this story, that is why they had to drag the plot in some not so interesting arc, like the terribly boring episode 9.

For 8 episodes the show is solid, with a weird construction all about flashback and countless jump in time between different timelines. It would have been better in my view, to tell the story in a more linear way, episode 1-3 Dahmer as a kid-teen, then dahmer adult and the killing era ,then only one episode about the after ( prison time/ neigbour pain/ dahmer parents afterlife).

But no, they had to gave us the Glenda show, do the point i have to ask, is she the real villain here ? She is stealing the pain of the families victims, she is acting like if she suffer as much as the families who lost a dear one ! WTF is wrong with her, Dahmer didnt kill your daughter, so stop being a drama queen. It was to the point my gf and I had to skip scenes with her, she tried to steal the spotlight and the pain. Also when I watch a TV show i want to be entertain, i dont Care about the families victim or worst about a neigbour. You can give them 20 minutes screen time thats it. I want to see the Monster Dahmer do his thing.

In the end If you had to remember one episode, and I will advise you to watch only this one, its the one about the deaf man, this episode was great TV, Overall i give the show a 7.5/10, losing half a point for the crazy Glenda. Also losing points for the joke of a final, Christopher the guy who killed dahmer appear to be a hero here, like if we are supposed to thank him. When in reality he is not at all the decent man it appear to be, he is a bigger psychopath than dahmer and probably a more dangerous person."
8.0,23 September 2022,"Loved it. Evan Peters is awesome and the depth of the story is fantastic. Really loved how they managed to portray the darkness without it just being merely a gore-fest. My main gripe is the majorly annoying Glenda and her terrible, terrible voice. Also wish they had focussed more on the intricacies of the murders rather than the back stories of the families. A lot of time was wasted on hypotheticals but all in all a good show, well worth the watch.

I'll be honest, I felt that there was an element of sadness running through this story, mostly in relation to Jeff. Obviously someone who needed support from such an early age."
10.0,22 September 2022,My husband I watched this yesterday all 10 episodes omg what a mini series from start to finish EVAN PETERS FANTASTIC AS JEFFERY DAHMER as we're all the actors never knew it was his white privilege let him get away with murder for so so long and how he was honest in his police interviews I didn't see EVAN PETERS as the AHS actor but JEFFREY DAHMER looks mannerisms the works or that a double hernia op could be blamed for the way he turned out 1 of the best real life mini series we have watched since ZAC EFRON as TED BUNDY. How the police ignored his neighbours follow up enquires over the safety of the 14 yr old they took back took him 10/10.

After Evan Peter, the lead actor in the true crime anthology won an accolade for his acting skills, the mother of one of Jeffrey Dahmer's victims spoke out against the series, reports Forbes.

In a recent interview with TMZ, Shirley Hughes, the mother of Tony Hughes, whose gruesome murder by Dahmer was dramatised in the Netflix series, expressed her disappointment at the situation. She said, ""People winning acting roles from playing killers keeps the obsession going and this makes sick people thrive on the fame. It's a shame that people can take our tragedy and make money."""
10.0,3 October 2022,"Summary

A shocking series that, however, does not resort to truculence and focuses on the characters, with a formidable Evan Peters as the serial killer obsessed and marked by abandonment and isolation, fully aware of his uncontrollable compulsions and who strikes fear as perhaps not seen since Kevin Spacey in Seven. The finished psychological painting of him results in a humanization that does not lead to empathy, but rather gives more thickness to his monstrous dimension. On the other hand, the series is not afraid to tackle from the beginning the political and social dimension of the case, even to the point of underlining, with a negligent police officer who deliberately and systematically dismissed or minimized complaints about a white man whose victims were African-Americans, brown-haired and Asian homosexuals. , ensuring their impunity for years.

Review:

The series follows the biography and crimes committed by serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.

The series co-produced and co-written by Ryan Murphy is an accumulation of successes, both in the narrative and technical aspects as well as in the psychological description of Dahmer and his positioning in front of the murderer and his circumstances.

Far from the deliberately overflowing and overloaded style of his other productions such as American Horror Story or Ratched, Murphy understands that such a tremendous story can only be taken seriously and soberly, as he had already done in the remarkable The Assassination of Gianni Versace.

Facing a murderer with necrophilic and anthropophagic elements (he was nicknamed the Milwaukee Cannibal), the first success of the series consists of avoiding the truculence by resorting to successful ellipses and off-screen shots and focusing on the psychological and bonding aspects of the protagonist. This does not prevent (and perhaps reinforces) that Dahmer's encounters with his victims transmit at times an unbearable tension, as he had not seen in stories of this type for a long time. The series manages to shock and horrify, sometimes painting absolutely macabre scenes.

Dahmer describes in detail and builds with the patience of a goldsmith a biography where the protagonist's relationship with his family is a fundamental element, even in his adult life: his mother, his father (a great performance by Richard Jenkins), his grandmother and his stepmother are masterfully painted. Elements of everyday life, some ""normal"" and others not so much, reading comics, situations and signs that in other people would not bring consequences and neglected warnings will have in this case disturbing resonances and consequences like germs of a murderer under construction.

The positioning of the series regarding the vulnerability of his victims is fundamental, making clear the decisive political dimension of the framework of impunity with which he acted. It is clear that Dahmer (and this is not a spoiler) was able to continue murdering in Milwaukee for years thanks to negligent police who deliberately and systematically dismissed complaints about a white man whose victims were black, brown and Asian homosexuals, complaints coming from those same communities, a corporate police that made little or no effort to investigate. The choice of these victims ensured the murderer, then, impunity for a long time. This dynamic is not only clear from the story, but it is expressed several times with words by some characters so that there are no doubts. Because of all this, certain objections made to the series by relatives of the victims caught my attention. It was even questioned that Netflix put the lgtbq label on the series...

Nor is it off the radar of the authors that the story of a murderer does not end with his imprisonment, following the tribulations of the bereaved, the fascination of American society with serial killers and reflecting on the value of the memory of the victims.

In a formidable performance, Evan Peters personifies Dahmer from his adolescence to his arrest and imprisonment, an individual obsessed and marked by abandonment and solitary confinement and fully aware of his irrepressible compulsions. His composition is quite successful at times lethargic, surprised and resigned of a condemned individual with no way out but who premeditatedly exploited the vulnerability of his victims. The finished psychological painting of him results in a humanization that does not lead to empathy, but rather gives more thickness to his monstrous dimension, far from the sensationalism of a fictional Hannibal Lecter, for example. Peters produces a chilling fear as a viewer has not lived since the memorable Kevin Spacey of Seven; he is a predatory assassin with some points of contact with that of The Serpent, but without the glamor of him.

Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy's script is excellent, as he seamlessly organizes and integrates everything, as the dimensions of history. The staging is sober, with an excellent recreation of the period (but without gloating), perfectly integrated into the cadence of the murderer, with a timeline that comes and goes in time and reproduces some situations by changing the point of view. There are long, breathing scenes that honor and provide the right setting and timing for their remarkable dialogue. It is no coincidence that some chapters with an almost dreamlike atmosphere at times are directed by Jennifer Lynch, David's daughter, where the locations, certain sectors of the houses, the lighting and the off-screen with the sound off also become disturbing. And palpable protagonists.

Perhaps it could be reproached that certain conclusions drawn by the viewer sooner rather than later are later underlined by the dialogues of some characters, so that there are no doubts about the intentions and positions of the characters and the filmmakers."
9.0,28 September 2022,"This is really one of the best documentaries I've ever watched in my whole life.

The director cared about all the details and he focused especially on the cast performances, and although some scenes were so terrifying but there was a reason behind that which was mainly to highlight how much this character was psychologically destroyed.

Evan Peters portrayed Dahmer with an astonishing performance, he kept the character on the same line across the 10 episodes, having a calm tone, and those calm reactions that are totally contradicting with what he is actually doing, in few scenes he lost his temper and when this happened he showed an extreme anger that is matching with the nature of this unstable character, like the scene with his grandma when she threw the mannequin that he had stolen from the store.

He has really awakened Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer and he completely understood the character and how gradually the character developed psychologically to be one of the most stranger cases of serial killers.

Richard Jinkens: Lionel Dahmer, he played the surprised father that refused the truth of his son with a great performance.

One of his master scenes was that one at the end when he admitted to his son that he blamed all who were surrounding him except himself and then he said ""Sorry that I was not the good father"" .. he felt each letter in this phrase and this scene especially summarized the impact of Jeff's father on him and on his case.

Penelope Ann Miller: Joyce Dahmer .. very good actress and although she has few scenes but her scenes were very significant, and you will stop as an audience in front of her performance in 4 special scenes: a scene when she shouted at her son telling him that he never wanted her when she was living the house, the scene in the court when she and Lionel accused each others of being the reason behind what happened to their son, and the scene when she was begging one of the grandmother for one of the victims to say something on behalf of Jeff in the court and the great scene when she tried to commit a suicide.

Neicy Nash: Glenda Cleveland .. this is an amazing actress, she played the scared neighbor that is monitoring all what's happening in her neighbor flat, I felt that she is really terrified especially when she was trying to inform the police with what happening .. one of her best scenes is that when Jeff asked her to eat the sandwich he offered to her and she refused and strongly asked him to get out of her house.

Micheal Learned : Catherine Dahmer (Jeff Grandmother) .. This is the only character that could change Jeff's life completely if he listened to her advices about going to the church or having a girlfriend .. she tried and tried and Micheal also played one of the great roles in this TV show.

Molly Ringwald: Shari Dahmer .. she is a very good actress and she was the kind person that supported Lionel in his crisis.

All the actors who played the victims' roles were great especially Rodney Burford who played Tony Hughes with a wonderful performance.

The scene between Jeff and the victims' family members in the court was amazing between those who were deeply sad and said

Although there were lots of movies produced previously about the story of Jeffrey Dahmer, however this tv show is the closest one to the truth .. Simply this is a masterpiece."
9.0,2 October 2022,"Evan Peters is truely magnificent in this series. The American Horror Series has certainly honed his ability to play truly insane characters, and Dahmer is up their the some of the most insane. The supporting cast are just as accomplished, drawing you into the drama that Dahmer created. This series will win multiple awards. It's well shot, well written, amazingly acted and sounds great. I find myself more and more drawn towards some of the fantastic series that are being produced over the Hollywood trash that's headed to the big screens. Easily worth a ten star rating and guaranteed to satisfy your binging needs."
9.0,23 September 2022,"I thought it was a movie when I first put it on and was upset when I found out it was a series but decided to let it play anyways and I am glad I did. As I watched the show, I did research on Dahmer to see how closely the story stuck to the true events that actually took place and the writers did a great job incorporating all of not most of what happened without embellishing too much if at all. The acting was superb from Dahmer's appearance to all of the extra cast members. The only flaw I found in the presentation was how the story jumped around and did not go in chronological order but I understood everything well enough as I had done my research on the time line of events. I don't support serial killers or murderers but the show I entertaining nonetheless and definitely worth a watch. Only 9 stars because there is no replay value."
8.0,6 October 2024,"All the actors were phenomenal, making it a perfect show all around, but Nathan Lane's character truly stood out as the best! His performance was captivating and added a unique depth to the series.

This show brought back some historical events I didn't remember clearly, such as the O. J. Simpson trial, the devastating earthquakes, the riots in L. A., and other significant but grim events that I won't delve into here. It was a powerful reminder of those turbulent times.

I was so engrossed that I binged the entire series in just two nights. The writers and directors did an exceptional job of keeping us on the edge of our seats, wondering what would happen next. Their storytelling was brilliantly executed, weaving suspense and drama seamlessly.

Initially, I didn't know much about the story, so I had no preconceived opinions. However, as the series progressed, I found myself forming strong opinions and by the end, my mind was made up. The narrative was so compelling that it drew me in completely.

Overall, it was a pretty wild and messed up story, but that's what made it so fascinating and unforgettable. The combination of stellar acting, historical context, and masterful storytelling made it a standout series that I would highly recommend to anyone..........."
4.0,22 September 2024,"* this is a monsters 2 review ( the lyle and erick story ) , and i see dahmer is 10/10 , perfect one And all those fheads who say that we are , what .., we are serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer * what a reference, Netflix Lmme say it clearly that i had never heard about lyle and erick story till Netflix announced the season 2 of monsters series , and i didnt want to know about their story so i could watch the series to know their story, and I waited almost 2 years for it and it was worth it , Season 2 of Monsters didnt disappoint me with almost everything, the story they chose , it was an interesting story to tell and had more details than Dahmer's one (From the legal side ) , and its ending wasnt really clear so i cant say my opinion cuz theres no proof of anything that the brothers said or any obvious proof on the lawyer's claims , To be honest i liked Dahmer's cinematography more than this one , cuz i think dahmer had an obvious style of cinematography and it was actually good , but also this one had a quite good cinematography, Whatever , I noticed that dahmer's story had a lot was going on while he was doing his crimes and his life in general unlike the brothers one , more things happened while their trial ( i mean they were showing us the same things that happened to them from their parents over and over again ), cuz dahmer was a serial killer n they weren't and ok i got it , their trial had a lot of things going on and if they wanted the public to believe them they could just act normal , they messed up a lot , both their lawyers and them They cared a lot about the public opinion but what they didn't know they was the public opinion gonna change immediately so fast about them and they have to be careful about what they were doing to say , honestly it was shocking thing to me that their lawyer didnt know that or she wasn't careful enough about that , I'd like to describe their crime like they put their anger feelings in a jar and when that jar exploded they couldn't handle it ( if their allegations about their parents were true ) , was killing their parents the best option? No at all , they moved from being victims to criminals, they put themselves in even bigger problems And i sympathetic w them , they were victims for years , since they were children n their environment was a toxic which explained their crime but it didnt excuse their crime , they deserved to be punishment , i think their punishment was fair for what they did , they could say allegations to their relatives or the cops at least , N honestly if that was true ,its heartbreaking but i can't defend them at all , killing their parents was so stupid thing to slove ur problem ,At the end of the day , they got what they deserved, n if their allegations were true i hope the parents will get what they deserve from god., And i really liked Nicholas and Cooper performance, it was kinda Nicolas' first lead role and he did great job , i hope non of them will be loved the way was some people loved Evan cuz of dahmer role ( i mean i hope they be loved as an actors not as killers ), and that's another Ryan good work Episode 5 was great , they both deserved awards for their performance."
9.0,24 October 2022,"After episode 6 turn it off. Race baiting galore that adds nothing to the story except pushing modern day agenda in 1990s setting. I'm not downplaying the suffering of the victims and families but in my opinion the show could've benefited greatly from sticking to Dahmer.

You never get to see his experiments, there's barely any gore or shock value, it feels very sterile and safe for a modern audience. Either write an original story or stick to the source material, but there's very little to be gained from making stuff up and throwing facts to the wind. Unless you had an alterior motive.

Stop after episode 6."
10.0,28 September 2022,"This is one of my favourite netflix series I think I've ever watched. Absolutely incredible, with phenomenal acting! I watched the entire series back to back.

It's played out quite similarly to the Assassination of Gianni Versace, (Andrew Cunanan) which I'm also a huge fan of. However, this series is far more compelling, accurate, intricate and unique to anything I've ever seen in relation to a serial killer.

I actually found myself becoming quite emotional and empathic throughout; toward both victim and perpetrator. This situation was seemingly inevitable. And I believe that it was a combination of both nature and nurture.

And to see that both Gregg Araki (one of my favourite directors) and Jennifer Lynch directed some the episodes! Amazing work."
8.0,10 October 2022,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * Awful

In 1991, in a run down apartment block in Milwaukee, police discovered the remains of several young men in the domicile of Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters), leading to his arrest and subsequent trial. He'd been operating for years, luring primarily young, gay black men back to his home, before drugging them, sexually abusing them and murdering them, and in some cases even consuming their body parts. The apathy and incompetence of the police aided greatly in his ability to evade detection for so long, targeting young, marginalised men who were disregarded by the police and society in general, casting a wider eye over the culture of the time in general.

Netflix seems to churn out a 'true life crime' series on a whim every few months, focusing on real life interviews with some of the most sinister and calculating killers ever to have walked the earth, aiming to delve into their psyches and make sense of their minds. And so we have this well received ten part production, charting the life and crimes of Jeffrey Dhamer, truly a worthy contender in the 'most evil killer ever' stakes. Told in reverse from the moment of his capture and arrest, it depicts his childhood, as a quiet but withdrawn child living with his doting but quarrelling parents, being walked over at school, before an unstable and fractured early adult life, unable to commit to anything or stick at a job, before having to go back and live with his dad, stepmom and temperamental grandmother.

In the lead role, Peters is undeniably effective, portraying Dahmer with a cool, calm detachment and iciness that seems to be pretty much a mirror image of the real life monster. But, with that said, somehow it's Richard Jenkins's supporting role as his father that leaves the most searing impression, projecting an unnerving ordinariness as the dad forced to come to terms with the shattering truth about his son. While undoubtedly a man with flaws and his own personal problems, he's still fundamentally a typical, all American dad, driven to doubt his own sanity, going through the motions as events unfold. It's common to imagine monstrous serial killers being abused, neglected and all the usual stereotypes of their parents that have been fixed in our brain, but Jenkins impresses what is probably the reality very effectively.

On a wider scale, as if the crimes of Dahmer weren't horrific enough, the case exposed the wider attitude of the police and society in general towards black communities and homosexuals, paving the way for lessons to be learned and wider societal change. Overall, a well managed, eerie and uncomfortable piece, that never veers over the edge and glamorises the crimes of its subject in any way. ****"
9.0,8 October 2022,"No pun intended - I mean there are serial killers where people go ""I would never have guessed it"", ""he was always so nice"" ... well you cannot really say that about Dahmer! There were so many warnings, there were so many close calls (literally and no pun intended), there were so many calls to stop him! This show will show most of them - and you will cringe when you think about how he got away with it so many times. And how nonchalant he is about all of it.

The show itself is all over the place - time wise that is. So you may have some issues following it. Or some may have that issue. If you let yourself into the mood, into the vibe, you'll get it and you'll love it. It is challenging, but so well structured that you won't mind. Also while we see the ""later"", it is then that we are told the past. Sometimes you get a cut from one scene to a totally different one - for shock value but also to keep your on your toes.

And while you may be asking yourself why some did not report his behavior ... you'll find out that they did ... but did not always find someone listening to them. I also watched the docu series that was also available to stream. While that was ok - this is more coherent, this seems more extensive, this seems to really get into the head of Dahmer.

Which may not be the best place to be. But it is what it is ... and the theme of loneliness ... well you can't deny them to say the least. It is anything but subtle ... Loneliness can kill a man (or more) - sorry for the pun."
9.0,16 October 2022,"It's a hit. I like crime themes, including murder, and this was pretty damn hilarious. Very interesting. The main draw for me was the fact that it was based on a true story. I enjoyed it. It was interesting to follow the life of Jeffrey Dahmer. The killers are generally interesting and so they are good to work with for the story, which I think worked well here. It went by quickly and I was almost sorry it was over. Not surprising when you can fit the highlights into 10 episodes. I'm just saying that it went by quickly and that I had fun. For me, a great series that I would recommend to crime genre enthusiasts."
9.0,10 October 2022,"A sick and evil serial killer who done unspeakable things to his victims is shown on full display, sometimes sadistic, sometimes playing the victim, Jeffrey was if nothing else a highly captivating person in Dahmer. From the outset the first episode really draws you in to what Jeff's MO was. Meaning what his tactic was for capturing and killing his victims. They lay out the first episode very well and have most of the story on display setting a general timeline for what has happened over the years. The next few episodes are a bit more average, consisting of flashbacks to Jeff as kid growing up and how he worked his way to killing, it's told well and acted even better so it's more than enough to keep you watching closely. Towards the final few episodes I felt like I had already seen everything to piece together exactly what the outcome was so it seemed to drag slightly at the tail end. One downside is the story itself should clearly be centred around the serial killer and what he done to his victims, who were from a vast array of races and creeds but instead certain episodes take time to push certain stereotypes and agendas onto us. The police are always the bad guys, they always messed up. People of certain races are always innocent etc. This is especially prevalent in the Casandra episode where it spends more time focused on racial matters than actually getting on track with what the show is about. This leads to a misguided nature at points and sadly nowadays this underlying message inserted into writing has become common place in most forms of media. Overall the show has a decent enough storyline and is structured well to what happened that it remains a really good captivating watch."
2.0,9 October 2022,"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, starring Evan Peters, who is brilliant, is so good. I normally wouldn't watch such a gruesome movie if the production was mediocre. But this series is outstanding, The writing is perfect. The acting, editing, directing, casting-all of it gels perfectly together. I got deep into it within 2 minutes.

Evan Peters gave an incredibly inspired performance. You just never knew that underneath that calm, good looking face was an astonishingly sick monster. But you knew he was sick. He was the perfect actor to cast in this role. He didn't have to act like he was sick. It was so natural to him. It was as if he was Jeffrey Dahmer. I remember reading about him in the 90s when the story broke. I couldn't read the whole article, it was so disturbing.

Yes, the creators and writers, Ryan Murphy and Ian Brenner, plus a few other writers, even were able to show a sympathetic side to this killer. Don't know if this is part of the real Jeffrey Dahmer story or a figment of the writers' imagination. You can even understand why he did the things he did.

When I saw Richard Jenkins was in this movie, I knew it would be a good one. He knows how to pick good movies. He was great in his role as Jeffrey's father. So perfect as the hot and cold father.

You may think, as I did, that this movie is a single-minded sensational story about a serial killer. You certainly get that impression in the first few episodes. But it turned out to be not a simple story.

Monster lays out a much deeper, more complicated and wider landscape. The writers accomplished the Herculean task of artfully fleshing out a few of the victims' lives with their families. At first, I didn't know where the writers were going with these subplots. But then I realized the writers were showing that these victims were normal, nice people. They were loving sons and brothers, they had jobs, they were gay, they weren't criminals and they weren't drug addicts.

They were beguiled by Dahmer's sweet sexy face and demeanor. He sweetly and politely lured them into his apartment, gave them coffee or soda or beer and put inside a drug that rendered the man helpless. Why he drugged them comes out in a later episode. There's more to it than your first impression.

There are 2 elephants in the room in this series: racism and testosterone. The writers don't really play up these words but their behavior is clearly present. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin police department was not incompetent, as some reviews and people say. They were racist. Dahmer was a normal-looking white man and almost all his victims were black, brown or Asian. Plus they were all gay, which was taboo and untouchable in the 70s and 80s. If Dahmer were a black man and all his victims were white, you can be sure he would've been arrested far sooner. The Milwaukee police ignored, avoided and neglected any complaints that had to do with Dahmer.

All throughout this series, the writers explore the one question that is on everyone's mind, especially his father's. Why? Why did Dahmer capture, imprison, torture, kill and eat 17 human lives? What drove him to do this? The father wonders if he passed his DNA on to his son. He wonders if his son was affected by them dissecting roadkill together in their garage. The father wonders if the mother's neglect turned him into such a cruel person. They did not, however, explore the practical and scientific aspect. Testosterone is the male hormone that causes violence, aggression and domination. Dahmer was extremely violent, aggressive and had a driving need to dominate, which is why he drugged all his victims. His psychiatrist did not check his testosterone level to see if it was dangerously high. No one made the connection between Dahmer's behavior and his hormone levels.

Evan Peters Is up for a 2023 SAG award for his role. Richard Jenkins should be recognized for his excellent supporting role as the father, which only got better and richer as the series went on. If Hollywood had the stomach, a best picture nomination might be forthcoming."
10.0,1 October 2022,"I finished watching it and I gave myself the night to really think about what I would write in my review, and honestly, it's hard to review. It hits all the main story beats quite well and the acting and direction are really top knotch. However, there is quite a bit that is completely inaccurate, or never even happened in the first place. It practically lends a hand at making Dahmer a movie monster, instead of being a biopic about him, i.e. Glenda not even living in the same building or being the one who discovers the 14 year old boy on the street, the fact that his dad never participated in or drove around and helped him pick up roadkill to practice his disections and taxidermy, the fact that he had a pretty normal childhood when compared to a lot of other people, the way some of his victims were killed, etc. That, in my opinion, is extremely disrespectful to the true story and to the victim's families. Makes me feel like this is exploitation at its worst. On the other hand, everyone does a bang up job, except Peters. Who again I feel is playing himself, just with a different style. For me, it just wasn't the transformation that everyone is raving about. Not to say he doesn't do a good job, I like the guy and love him on AHS, but I just can't see him as a serious actor in anything else. The direction was perfect for the series, and the writing feels genuine and authentic, minus the embellishments. I just still can't get over how exploitative this all feels, and how the families of the victims must feel about their tragedy being put up as a horror series, let alone have to see and hear about it everywhere they look. Had they added more of the victims and cut out some of the murderous stuff, like show us what happened without showing us what happened type of stuff, and if they had cared to stick to the facts, I might have liked this a bit better. As it stands though, I think the series is unnecessary, crude, inaccurate and disrespectful, regardless of how well it was made. The fact that so many people are rating this so highly is beyond me. If this had been released 20 years ago, it wouldn't have seen the light of day. Not because of the content, but because people would've cared enough about the families and realized this was disrespectful material. 1 deeply disturbed individual out of 5."
9.0,4 October 2022,"I went into this show ready to see a monster in action. Ready to see the life of a dangerous killer, someone so far from being human. Instead I found myself face to face with a real person.

The show takes you on a complete emotional journey, the transition of a regular young man with ordinary struggles - in the process of becoming a serial killer. Evan Peter's' acting left the audience with such a strong desire for Dahmer to be loved. His work demonstrated that anyone left to fend for themselves in such a volatile environment, could have become what Jeffery Dahmer became. As if, in the same position, it could have been you or me.

This series is an incredibly moving peek into the slow, yet, completely plausible, descent into complete madness."
8.0,22 September 2022,"I typically don't write reviews. But i have too say Evan Peters is JEFFREY DAHMER. Everything from his midwest accent, down too his mannerisms, he is a perfect fit for this role.

Now being a gay man myself and out too a very supportive family. I must say that their were SO MANY ""red flags"" where Jeff could have received the help he needed too ""come out"" and deal with his obsessions with the macabre. He was crying out for help and know one was listening. Let me be perfectly clear here. I DO NOT condone what he did on ANY LEVEL. As he definitely had deep psychological problems. But i do believe with a different upbringing and more ""understanding"" parents things may have gone differently for him.

The true moral of this story folks is too make sure your listening too your kids. And i mean TRULY listening when they come too you and want to talk. Jeff didn't have this and resorted too heavy drinking which only made his psychological problems even worse. If he were able too talk with a psychiatrist and be put on the proper medication. I think his sanity and soul could have been saved. Their is a part of me that feels very sorry for him that he didn't have access too this kind of help.

When you examine the first few episodes you see a father encouraging him in behavior that was ""abnormal"". Picking up roadkill and cutting it open only deepened his fascination with the macabre. And in turn worsened his psychological welfare. So in that regard YES i blame the father for getting him interested in such abnormal activities. He also couldn't handle the divorce and that is when he immediately needed counseling. Because he spiraled out of control from that point forward.

The bottom line here is people can be ""saved"" if they have the proper channels and outlets. Even if they are incapable of seeing themselves changing for the better. As an outsider one must still try and exhaust all efforts too save that individual from such psychological torment. Jeff had none of those outlets. And it's a shame that his life turned out the way it did. He certainly was born gay but i don't believe he would have done the monstrous things he did. If it wasn't influenced on him at such an early stage from his dad. So i hold him accountable for part of his issues. Upbringing and good parenting skills are vital too ANY child's outcome as they reach adulthood. All in all an EXCELLENT performance of a truly troubled soul that was desperately crying out for help."
10.0,2 October 2022,"I watched this move, and found it very hard to watch, I can only imagine how the families of his victims feel about this movie, I hope that the person that played Dahmer did not ruing his career with this movie, I feel like every time you will see this actor in the future all people will remember is his portrayal of Dahmer, I really don't understand how the police did not know about his actions sooner, his neighbor in the movie said that she had called the police several times, because of the awful smell that was coming from his apartment, and this wasn't in the movie but I remember how the police returned the young Asian boy back to Dahmer, and then can be heard laughing about the situation, and Dahmer killed him as soon at the police left, This movie had no regard for the family of those he killed. If you don't have a strong stomach don't watch it. The reason I gave it 9 stars was because of the man that played Dahmer."
8.0,8 October 2022,"I have no idea if anything or how much is factual or true (I've not checked).

That being said, as stand alone entertainment, I felt it was well written, casted and acted. The lead characters delivered well, I applaud the production and look forward to similar from Netflix.

In a desert of bland entertainment the last 10 years, this is an oasis of talent.

Naturally, I felt sad for the victims and families, but I also felt pity for Jeffrey, that's how well this was made. The natural inclination would be to be repulsed by the killer, but I felt sorry that he was so broken by his experiences since he was a kid. In many ways perhaps a victim as much as the people he brutally killed. It highlighted too the social issues that allowed it all to happen.

If that was the intent, then it worked on me. Well done."
8.0,25 September 2022,I have watched several programmes about dahmer this is by far the best one. The sad reality is most people watch these to find out about the murderer because they want to understand how someone could do those things. What made this show great is that it gave us that insight but it also gave us a huge insight into the victims and their families and Dahmers family. I have not seen this done so well in any of the other dahmer series /films. This series shows the failures of the police and the injustice for the community and families of Dahmers victims it leaves you feeling sick with anger at the lack of responsibility of those in power at the time of his killings. It doesn't glorify Dahmer but shines a light on those who fought to bring him to justice. Evan peters deserves all the recognition for his portrayal of dahmer he does and amazing job and so does Niecy Nash who deliveries an outstanding performance as Glenda Cleveland his neighbour that never gave up trying to stop him from committing these crimes. This series could not be done to a higher quality.
2.0,13 October 2022,"Being a teenager from the Netherlands, I had never heard of Jeffrey Dahmer before, but still I decided to take a look. And let me say I was not expecting this...

It puts you right into all things disturbing right from the beginning. In my opinion the first episode was already the best one. And from that first episode I already felt like I knew what Jeffrey Dahmer was all about. Evan Peter's portrayal helped alot with that, he was absolutely fantastic in this. The way he looked, the way he talked... everything made him really unsetteling. Also pretty much all the other actors were amazing!

The way everything looked it felt like you were always there yourself. And the story was told brilliantly. They worked with a lot of timejumps, which was a really good choice. It was like this: Something happens, then you go back to something in the past until you are back at where you began, which explains so much of the story.

I am usually not so much of a guy who watches shows... but this one I watched completely just in a couple of days.

8.3/10."
9.0,27 September 2022,"I only could get to EP3 but the question is...why?

Why did this need to be made? Look, I love true crime and I get the entertainment in indulging in something like this, but considering other reviews I've read and what I saw so far, why even make something like this when it's not 100% accurate to the story and it's basically like you're glamorizing him? Do we really need to sit and watch 10 hours of this horrible individual? Having the families re-live this trauma? Which apparently the victims families weren't even notified of this series being created. Sad and gross.

All that to make a buck tho, huh?"
10.0,3 October 2022,
10.0,23 September 2022,"I can't believe how amazing this limited series is! It's like, 'someone else out there really gets me'!

After binge watching the first five episodes, I learned that I had to watch the rest of the series in just 2 or 3 shows blocks at a time, because as we've all learned from those certain pharmaceutical commercials - seek medical care for erections lasting more than 4 hours! I should have known better. Emergency Room visits ain't cheap, my friends.

The intensity of Evan Peters is mind blowing. I can almost feel his breath in my ear, and his fingers caressing my chest. And the blood! Oh my gosh, I can smell the metallic odor and taste it from how well the cinematography pulls me in!"
8.0,16 October 2022,"When i watched the trailer of This Dahmer series i thought this will be the average series but this is on another level i love to watch this series this web series is just mind blowing you can go through this and even i will recommend this web series to you. There's something dramatic, intense about how that man can transform into his character.

The producer (Ryan Murphy) has been working with Evan for more than a decade on American Horror Story so we've seen him in a few different roles and I'm always Loving the sometimes ""eerie filming"", there's a sinister vibe in every aspects of the show!"
9.0,25 September 2022,"Can't believe the guy who played Michael Scott's nephew was such a good actor. (from: the office) The Dahmer story is so freaky, it's kind of terrifying. Scenes are absurd, characters are killer and the story line is very unique with almost no background music; which makes it even more scary. Takes a dig at the broken police system, a little racist backdrop and the Jeff dahmer character takes a place around 1966 timeline. It's a worth watch for anyone that likes crime drama and serial killer shows. It's interesting from the very first episode and stays like that throughout. You're gonna wanna avoid eating while watching though. It's gets a bit disgusting in some parts.

Happy watching!"

10.0,10 October 2022,"This was a waste of 7 and a half hours of my life. They had warnings of gore, sexual violence and other stuff. Only one scene of sexual violence, absolutely no gore and the story lied about the lady being his next door neighbor. I guess netflix had to stretch the truth in order to get its investment back. There was only one funny part that made me laugh. Other than that it was pretty lame. I have seen more gore and violence from the texas chainsaw massacre movies. The netflix needs to stop financing this type of junk and focus on renewing series that have not been renewed since 2019. I was 24 when this happened and the newspapers gave a more accurate account of the events and made it more interesting than this garbage."
8.0,28 September 2022,"Not graphic at all, found it to focus more on the victims and he's and their back stories other then the actual murders in graphic detail plus how the law enforcement let these men down. I just couldn't look away the whole time. Ryan Murphy done an amazing job as always and of course Evan Peters done an excellent job getting into his role as Jeffrey but he's always amazing at any role he plays so it's no surprise. I personally would of liked to see it be a little more graphic but I can understand why they didn't make it so graphic. I truly hope Evan Peters and Ryan Murphy get the Recognition they deserve for this amazing piece!"
10.0,9 October 2022,
8.0,2 October 2022,"Evan peters was fantastic. I'd like to say he should get an Emmy or golden glove but don't want to glamorise the reality of a real life serial killer.

It was shot to show it from the victims and families perspective. I think that was respectful but they could have gone further. I'm glad there was no actual gruesome scenes showing the kills. It made it much more tasteful.

Jeff is sweaty all the time as they all are. Haha everyone smokes and there is no air con.

What scares me the most was the overt racism. Made me feel pretty sick to think being white held that much power and it wasn't that long ago. Jeff was so creepy and detached.

Evan did a stunning job. Oh but the contacts he wears in the poster aren't real. Evan has brown eyes as did Jeff in the show or they looked it That was disappointing as I felt the pale eyes would have made him seem more predatory.

Watch in snippets and as I said, I needed to be in the mood as it was very dark."
8.0,30 September 2022,"This was a historically accurate look at Dahmer. They didn't add or take away from the story. This show does a great job of seeing these crimes through the eyes of the victims, and it creates a chilling new perspective. They didn't glamorous Dahmer which I appreciated. At times this was brutal, but Even Peters kept you dialed in, his characterization of Dahmer didn't disappoint. He adds to the reality and grit, with a great performance, he deserves all the awards. The story is spread throughout his life and picks up in different areas, but it comes together well. It also takes you away from the jarring violence, giving much needed breaks."
10.0,1 October 2022,"Finished watching ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"". It is quite good watch. In a sense, that artistically it is good, like the somewhat sticky atmosphere, and minor details, that would normally be glossed over. There was 1 thing, that I did not like and 1 that I think could have been better.

During the 1st episodes, which were focusing on Dahmer himself, there were a lot of time jumps, which did not make much sense to do at all. I am not talking about some sort of flashbacks, but literal ""jumps"" in the middle of the episode. I would not mind them, if it was clear which of the scenes are ""the past"", but unless we were seeing Dahmer as a kid - it was quite difficult to distinguish. I believe this story would be much better as something more linear.

Which was proved right in the 2nd part of the series, which unfortunately had a different issue for me: it focused on people around Dahmer or his victims. Granted, those stories probably needed to be told, especially those after he was caught. But there were at least 2 episodes that were taking place during his killings, while in the main ""continuity"" of the series he was caught twice already: in the beginning of the series, and then in the middle of it, as we ""relived"" the event with some more details.

I guess, in a way, my 2nd complaint is very similar to the 1st one: those events should have happened in a linear fasion. Or, alternatively, as much shorter flashback during court hearings shown later in the series.

But otherwise, it's still quite a compelling story. There is no psychosis or any craziness here. Just monotonous and almost mindless cruelty."
2.0,23 September 2024,
10.0,22 September 2022,"Okay, the first episode was promising. The second episode was meh but I hung in there. By the third episode my suspicions were confirmed. Ryan Murphy decided to gloss over facts and turn it in to a Lifetime Network miniseries of the week. Lots of fluff and filler over the the actual story. There is so much in this series that can't possibly be true. Murphy decides to tell us more about Dahmers parents, early years, teen years and high school years. Things that he possibly couldn't know. It's all fiction and filler. Meanwhile you're taken away from what you came for, to learn about Dahmer the Serial Killer and his psyche. There is no real exploration in to that or the horror his victims endured. It's really just a fictional puff piece sprinkled with factual events. And Evan Peters was not the right actor for this. He's just too likeable. You may actually feel sympathy for Jeffrey Dahmer and at times see him as a victim himself. What an insult to the real victims and their families and the horrors they endured from this monster. Quantity over quality at ten episodes. That's the Netflix way. This could have been done effectively in four episodes and stick to the facts with much better actors and director. Big swing and a miss by Netflix, again."
10.0,30 September 2022,"Gripping macabre and chilling the whole way through with more than its fair share of racism and systemic corruption which is ultimately why he got away with it for so long,Peters is excellent as Jeff and his Canadian accent is simply awesome. A brilliant series and beautiful production it didn't let me down as I compared it to the book I read late 90s.

This production is as good as the book that haunted me for years as a teenager and the cinematography brought me back to the 80s so easily, those Budweiser 300cl cans and rugby shirts with 'slacks' were the dogs bollox of that era.

Really enjoyed this project,well done to all especially Peters,he's gona get all the plaudits and rightly so.9/10."

8.0,1 October 2022,"For dahmer to do all he did it was shocking to see him become a statistic of Scarver. Christopher Scarver is a scary guy! Wow. He doesn't seem violent in the beginning but he proved that he could be. Frightening guy and powerful scene. This is the best episode throughout the entire series. Dahmer did a lot of cowardly like killings, nothing worth talking about really. I was surprised to see that this was a 10 episodes. He had a good father though the mother was half nut. That's no excuse. He had every opportunity to do something productive with his life he chose otherwise. It was disappointing to see lionel not willing to allow those that were killed families to receive compensation for the projects he had in plan. I expected more from him but people show who they are eventually. Anyway amazing episode! Brilliant job and well done to the director and writers!"
9.0,30 September 2022,"The Jeffrey Dahmer Story is an amazingly done series that turns over every stone to help the viewer create their own theory on why Dahmer was the way he was as well as exposing the carelessness of some which certainly led to him continuing to do his awful deeds. We see Dahmer as a teenager already realizing that something is wrong with him and that he needs help. Because of his father's inability to see his cry for help, Dahmer is able to keep navigating his life and struggle due to alcoholism and begin to feed his bloodlust in secret.

The acting in this series is superb from Evan Peters, who portrays the character of Dahmer flawlessly and convincingly as well as Richard Jenkins portraying Lionel Dahmer. Jenkins is one of my favorite character actors and he really makes you empathize with Mr. Dahmer. Most impressive is Niecy Nash's portrayal of Glenda Cleveland. It's hard to believe that Nash went from a mediocre comedy like Reno 911! To this.

There is, of course much social propoganda some of which makes sense but I'm not sure all of it fits the accuracy of the events surrounding Dahmer's misdeeds. I don't buy that Dahmer preyed specifically on blacks. I think this was circumstantial based on the neighborhood he was in. The carelessness of police and possible neglect of black victims portrayed here serves well as a morality tale telling us that we can do better as a society. As a mental health professional who desires to keep learning, I definitely recommend this series if you want a deeper understanding of the person and mind of Dahmer."
10.0,10 October 2022,"This serie makes me watch away where a horror would make me bored. I am so disgusted by what I am watching knowing it was real (of course with some alterations as racism is a big subject as well) that it's intriguing and that makes me feel filthy. I'd say good job, but I am sorry for all his victims and their families.

And now I notice imdb now requires a lot of characters but what more can I say? Imagine that you have to play this role. Good job from the main actor, I wonder if people in real life look at him differently now. Imagine meeting him a bar now, I would certainly turn 180 and walk away..."
2.0,25 September 2022,"A mini tv series well executed and directed with a power packed cast. Evan Peters as Jeffrey Doehmer kicks ass. He portrayed the monster very well! The 10 episode series is well engaging with true characters, the victims of his heinous crimes. Every episode has its own life to it, be it sadness, thriller or grossness. Even though we are all well familiar with the gruesome Jeffrey Doehmer and his story, the tv series did justice to its every details. At the end of the day, you feel for the poor victims and the people who came across this monster. Again, Evan Peters deserve an Emmy ! Hats off to you!"
8.0,29 September 2022,Peter Evans is a masterful actor. I wanted to watch this series as I love American Horror Story and in my opinion Evan's work in AHS is outstanding. The problem for me with this Jeffrey Dahmer series is that is it based on true events and quite frankly it makes me feel extremely uneasy for myself and the victims and their families on seeing how a psychopath stalked and killed his prey. Do I really need to know these details in my life for entertainment? No I don't and that's why I stopped watching it. Jeffrey was an extremely sick individual and putting his sickness on tv for others to emulate or marvel over is quite revolting. If you like feeling Ill from watching how a monster destroyed lives then you will probably rate this higher than I did.
9.0,25 September 2022,"I've seen a lot of people complain or comment on how difficult this series is to watch. But it's supposed to be. I've read a lot on Dahmer and his case and sometimes it's easy to forget that real people with hopes, dreams and day to day troubles died in horrific ways.

Sure there have been dramatisations of serial killers lives before but they typically focus wholeheartedly on their story, with little regard to those who lost their lives.

This show doesn't do this. Yes, there are segments that show insight into Dahmer and his childhood, but it detaches itself from being entirely from his perspective.

This show gives the young men who died a voice, it makes the audience see them as people. Something that is often missing from written accounts of Dahmer and his crimes.

Evan Peters has done a fantastic job, from the blank expressions and monotone voice to the way he moves and recounts Dahmers crimes in the interview scenes. The cast is incredible strong and all have done a wonderful job of portraying those who were impacted.

Lastly, the show largely stuck to what is commonly known about Dahmer and his life. There were moments that weren't fully accurate (the jogger as an example), but, as the real life version was horrendous enough, I'm glad that directors didn't feel the need to embellish things even further for the sake of viewers.

Well done to all involved."
10.0,10 October 2023,"I have watched lot of series like ""Wednesday"", ""The Boys"", ""Mr. Robot"", ""Only Murders In The Building"", ""Daybreak"", ""Halo"", etc. There are more series I have watched but no one impressed me till now. It was like ""okay nice!"" and Nothing. None of these series had impressed me or touched my heart because there was nothing I could see very clearly that was impressible or could really give me a chilling Vibe. But This Show is Really Fabulous, Wonderful, And The Best Series of 2022 I Think So. Also I never made any of show my favourite before because you know why. I already told said that noone of them impressed me enough. And maybe this is the first time I'm writing a Review for a web series. Lot of peoples were saying that it's kind of nightmare to us. But It Was Not, but yeah there are 0% things that were hetable."
8.0,19 October 2022,
8.0,3 October 2022,"As someone who has always been intrigued by true crime, I must say that this series was well directed. Evan Peters gives an Astounding Performance as Jeffery Dahmer. This series was informational with some fictional accents obviously for dramatic purposes. The only thing that I will say is that I'm not too fond of how the victims and their families were exploited without consent. Many people who have known Jeff or the victims talk about how movies are traumatizing because they once again have to re-live that experience or the loss of their loved one.

I really hated how icky it made me to be so fascinated by this series. It made my skin crawl and my blood boil. All in all, I would recommend it to my friends who don't have light stomachs and don't mind gore/murder."
9.0,9 October 2024,"This engrossing and not really predictable series about this disfunctional family is the dream of any horror filmmaker. Watching the life of Lyle and Erick Menéndez and the fishy double-life that they needed to present to the society is totally psycho-stunning! Truth is often stranger than fiction, but with this really riveting series you feel the tension like being part of this family's nightmare. Just amazing and really well-founded, but also leaves that familiar hole of emptiness in our conscience of in what reality we're actually living. And, of course, the really good job of the director who has an unpredictable style. It leaves a lot of clues and sometimes non-sense scences throughtly the story telling just only for playing with our assumptions and fears."
1.0,21 September 2022,
8.0,17 October 2022,"I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of the first episode. The tone is completely off. They've written this show like a horror movie which is too good of a treatment for a villain like Jeffrey Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer doesn't deserve a TV show. His work doesn't deserve to be glamorized and showcased for a wide audience.

I think this would've been better as a documentary subject where we can give victims and families a voice rather than dramatizing them on screen and also where we could extract broader meaning to what his killings meant and what we cab learn.

I'm not trying to make a moral argument against true crime material. I've consumed as much as anyone, but certain subjects are only properly treated in a specific medium and I don't think TV miniseries is right for Dahmer. I only gave this a second start because I love Evan Peters."
10.0,28 September 2022,
8.0,8 October 2022,"I have to start out by saying that it made me happy to see Evan Peters in this role, and he played it perfectly, in my honest opinion. It gave me the vibe that also comes from the Manhunt series. Very well executed all around.

I got heavily invested in Jeffrey Dahmer and fact checking quite a lot of what happened in the series to what happened irl. They really upped a lot of details around his childhood and his living conditions in the apartment for the series - which worked well for the story. These things made the series more interesting, as well as giving it a bigger impact on me. I am glad I fact-checked some stuff because the series really makes it impossible to believe, what was happening was doable for Jeffrey.

The series is obviously not for the faint of heart, but not too heavy on the gore - enough to know what was happening.

Don't start the watch too late on your evening... You will struggle to stop again!"
8.0,28 September 2022,
9.0,1 October 2024,"The story starts with two boys brutally murdering their parents without any context at all. Now, everyone is confused that why they did that, even their parents had no idea that this is going to happen.

The story became interesting after they surrendered themselves and the truth about their motivation to kill their parents because of the dark and gritty family secrets they have is unveiled.

I think actor Cooper Koch who played Erik in the show understood the assignment well alomg with the other people in cast. The show is raw, starts a discussion again, because you will be left with many questions once it ends.

The problem is that it is being said, that this adapatation is not true to the real story of the case and how the two brothers were demonized in the show is very wrong which overshadows all the torment they faced in their life.

Overall, the series is really beautifully done as expected by the creators of Dahmer, but then when you dig deep, more research work would have made the show a much better watch. The background score is eery, the scene transition is beautiful, and it is a must watch but one cannot make up their mind seeing the show, if the brother were actually guilty of the crime or not."
4.0,27 March 2024,"""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is a meticulously crafted TV series that delves deep into the chilling world of one of history's most notorious serial killers. From its haunting cinematography to its impeccable casting, the show captivates viewers from start to finish. The performances, particularly by the lead actor portraying Jeffrey Dahmer, are nothing short of remarkable, capturing the complex nuances of his character with chilling authenticity. The series masterfully navigates the delicate balance between psychological insight and narrative tension, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout. With its meticulous attention to detail and unflinching exploration of the human psyche, ""Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" is a must-watch for true crime aficionados and television enthusiasts alike."
8.0,15 October 2022,"First off...I'm not a reviewer! I always add stars for things on IMDB, but I think...this is my first ever review.

I know if I like it, or if it's alright, or it's awful....but this needs a review from me.

This was SO disturbing!!

I've watched this all happen in REAL time, as I was in my 30's when it did.

NOTHING I ever read, no books, no newspaper accounts, or movies, EVER brought this real story to life like this one did!

And...I'll tell you why!

Evan Peters!

The more episodes I watched, the more I felt like Dahmer was portrayed by the most perfect person to do him!

I'm wondering...Evan is a wonderful actor. I haven't missed one episode of American Horror Story, and he's great in everything he's done on it.... BUT, does he feel anything about the fact...that he's the best portrayer of Dahmer ever?

There were times when I actually had to quit watching it, and come back days later to finally finish the series.

I don't remember doing that before, and I've watched everything in my 72 years.

Well done, of course to everyone involved in this program, that I actually left my first ever review."
2.0,16 October 2022,"Loved Evans play and other actors.... Two star for them

The rest i give it 0... It's a fiction using dahmer's and the victim's names. It's a shame really. If you've read about what happened, you probably shouldn't watch it. It made me angry.

The serie doesn't give victims any attention, they are use like any characters in any series or movies... I really feel it's a bad use of their names... an offence to their memory and the families.

The psychology of the ""Dahmer character"" seems far from reality... I feel like a lot of the script made him sound like someone/something he is not. Lot of what they portrayed as his childhood and all the family stuff along the show is far from reality... Again.

SO PLEASE, if you are doing a fiction, don't use the names of people who died under horrible circumstances. Don't use the name of a multitude murderer who've hurt a lot of people and families.

Just do a freaking fiction!"
2.0,7 October 2022,"Very well played. Extremely disturbing. As most of the recent netlix crime stories should be condensed to fewer episodes. I wish Jeff had Dexter step father guidance, its not only the mental aspect of a serial killer, its the very poor parenting or guidance from early age that made this dark passengers resurface.

I am Absolutely NOT taking his side, but objectively speaking, He cried for help, he tried to express his loneliness, he knew there is something extremely wrong within himself, with his sick urges, but nobody listened. I won't fix it here, however, The fact that there are or were people mentally disturbed like Jeff among our society that have or cannot find their place to fit in is very disturbing and should not be overlooked. He was failed by his people who brought him up, and by society too and let for killing splurge.

I feel it must be extremely difficult for the victims relatives to relived this story all over again for sole purpose of public entertainment... it should at least have some impact on us, as society as whole to pay closer attention & listen to one another. Nobody should be alone. Especially, after the horrible 2 years of pandemic where so many feel lonely & isolated."
5.0,24 September 2024,"This isn't just another rehash of the same old story; it's a raw, detailed exploration that brings both the crimes and the systemic failures surrounding them into sharp focus. Monster is an unsettling yet captivating series that dives deep into the mind of one of America's most notorious serial killers, Jeffrey Dahmer.

Evan Peters absolutely nails the role of Dahmer. His portrayal is chilling, nuanced, and shockingly human in the most twisted way possible. You almost feel like you're there, witnessing each horrific moment unfold. The supporting cast, particularly Richard Jenkins as Dahmer's father, also delivers incredible performances that enhance the emotional weight of the series.

However, the series isn't perfect. The timeline jumps around, which can be a little hard to follow, and the pacing in some of the later episodes feels slower than necessary. Still, the overall impact is powerful and stays with you long after the credits roll."
3.0,7 October 2022,"I tried to avoid watching this Series knowing that it would be gruesome. I made sure that I was not hungry and only had a few chips and a coke. You see, I was a TV Broadcast Engineer for a well known national cable news station. I vividly remember this breaking news and how we reported on this from beginning to end.

While working in TV news I thought I had seen just about all the surprising stuff on serial killers. But, Jeffrey Dahmer really shocked the mess out of me! I would talk with anyone that would listen. My two sisters didn't want to hear about it and thought I was crazy for talking about it.

I had decided back then that this guy was pure evil. I didn't care what happened in his childhood that might have made him the monster he had become. Believe me, there is nothing that would cause this absolutely despicable behavior to come about. Can you imagine the innocent victims that fell prey to this predator??? It was unthinkable.

Jeffrey Dahmer was not insane. However, he was not a normal person. He was a psychopath. He was a predator. He was so good at what he did until he was able to get away with it for over a decade. Even he said he knew what he was doing. He did not want to plead insanity. In fact, he wanted to be executed for his crimes. But, Wisconsin did not have the death penalty.

Jeffrey Dahmer consciously lived in a predominately black neighborhood and killed, dismembered, and ate body parts of a lot of his victims. Also, 10 out of the 17 men he murdered were Black Americans. If Dahmer hadn't been caught, he would have continued to do what he did so well.

Dahmer lived in that community knowing that the police would not believe his black female neighbor living in the apartment next door. She and other black neighbors reported on this man repeatedly. Dahmer was so manipulative, cool, and calm that law enforcement believed him instead of his neighbors. He had the perfect cover for his crime and would stalk men that were mostly transient, gay, and non-white. He said that it was because they were the most attractive men in the gay clubs he frequented. But, do you really believe that? Well... I don't.

The series was great and these things actually happened. The actor resembles Jeffrey Dahmer and he had his mannerisms. When you really get down to it, criminals (serial killers) like Jeffrey Dahmer, want to be famous. They want to be noticed, to be known, to be talked about. They want to be a Serial Killer Legend. Dahmer really enjoyed all of this and when it was over and he was in prison he could sit back and enjoy the adulation from his fans from all over the world.

I'm glad Dahmer met his fate.

See the Series.

I feel for the victims and their families."

2.0,30 September 2022,"My god this show is SLOW moving. Seriously, I kept on putting the show on pause because I will just lose interest in how slow and boring it is. I feel like the hype of the show is base on people being a fan of Peter Evans and not because of the show itself. Yes, perhaps Peter Evans did a good job in acting but I feel the rest of the screen play is just horrible. There is WAY TOO MUCH focus on Evan Peter as an actor than who ge us actually portraying in the show. Which is why I feel it's irrelevant if this show was meant to be about Jeffery Dahmer or something entirely different like Pokemon?! I just can't. I gave up after I finished the third episode. It's just...that bad. I also highly doubt that's how the real Jeffery Dahmer was like as well. This is such hollywoodfied throw up of a serial killer's biography."
4.0,25 September 2022,"Another brilliant performance from Evan Peters, as well as Richard Jenkins. The series had a good pace, kept our interest through our binge nights--usually 2-3 episodes a night. Peters captures the mannerisms of Dahmer very well, from his almost-distant gaze, to his way of speaking. Jenkins did a superb job as a distraught father torn to pieces at the idea he may have made his son into the man that fascinated the nation with his disturbing crimes. Definitely one of the better iterations I have seen on Dahmer--solely due to Evan Peters' portayal.

The only negatives I would mention that actually annoyed me while I was watching were the fact that it jumped around so much, with the flash-backs and flash-fowards, it just became too confusing at times, especially when they started repeating scenes that we had seen earlier, just not in their entirety. It just became too muddy sometimes. The other negative is that they concentrated too much on his neighbor. Given the fact he lived next door to her gave her character relevance to the story, but it didn't warrant the amount of story and dialogue we had to endure. I found myself asking the question, why is any of this important to the main story? And the answer was, and is, that it's not. The series, although very well done, and obviously we'll acted, could have been shortened by a full episode by eliminating the need to flesh out her story. It wasn't necessary. She wasn't a victim, she just lived next door. And the fact that she always brought Dahmer up to co-workers, when one of them mentions how Gacy was the worst-of-the-worst, and she says her neighbor was and asks her if she ever smelled a dead body. It was just stupid writing and didn't need to be in there, all it did was fill up time and take focus off of Dahmer and the families of the victims.

Overall, the main actors did a superb job and the series was very well made. I already knew the Dahmer story, as I do most of the other famous serial killers, but it was nice to see the minor details that aren't always made known in other sources, and this series did a good job fleshing those out. I wish we saw and heard a lot less of the neighbor, it was just unnecessary filler in an otherwise perfect series."
4.0,22 May 2024,This a story about serial killer. But it's not just a story. It's not even about murders. It's not a crime that's bother me. For the first time in my life I have a chance to meet and to listen and to know everyrhing that is connected to serial killer mind. And that's amazing in so many ways. You can see how one regular man function in every day life. How he struggles to stay normal. His frustration with fact that he can't express his sexual preference to his nearest family and the fact that they left him alone in his 17es it's same cruel as fact that he was sick. His parents destroyed him and they were the ones that should be prisoned for life. He just needed medical help for the rest of his life.
3.0,7 October 2022,"Evan PETERS carrying this show with all the actors with their amazing ACTING, bring us to the scenes like it's really happen Infront of our eyes ... So yeah, all this score 8 it's mostly for Evan peters acting and the way he carried the story, the story also sad, I would've give 10 if it's accurate but just learned that some of the scenes are inaccurate and create for drama purposes, which is sad, and that is kinda disrespectful for the victims tho.

So for a thriller with psychological horror, this is a good watch but for accuracy, I would watch the TAPE documentaries that coming soon instead

Anyway, about this movie,the HYPE is soo good but is so hard to watch! Despite of amazing acting of Evan Peter, this series is so disturbing and real. But it is HARD AND physiologically GROSS and SCARY.

You need a mental of steel if you easily anxious like me.

But after 4 episodes, they also going a little bit slow

Anyway about Evan Peters

I am so shock... i cant even see him in here, and even tho that is actually performance to praise as an actor going into deep to character and deliver the story perfectly, I FEEL SAD! I feel sad because i am FREAKING TERRIFIED OF EVAN PETERS, i mean, I pass Tate, i Pass all CULT, AHS hotel and season 10 vampire Evan Peters... but this one i just SIMPLY CANT, the acting so good its scares me! I honestly wanted to STOP WATCHING, but the story is so intrigue and well present is the only reason i am keep watching this. In my head, the actor is not Evan Peters. Idk. I'm scared!"

One of the best scary scenes when Dahmer went next door to try and intimidate his neighbor with a sandwich never happened as that woman was NOT his neighbor...Make sure ALL the cops are either incompetent, evil or both...Make another murderer (the black inmate that that kills Dahmer) into a tortured soul of righteousness and religiosity (and who, snarf...DID NOT KNOW who Jeffrey Dahmer was) instead of the insane killer he was and you get a sense of how this series plays out. Watch true crime docs on Dahmer if you want the truth.

The acting is good, Dahmer played like he appeared in newsreels as was his Dad."
1.0,28 September 2022,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm a massive true crime reader, but I was worried about this show because the last thing I ever want is to watch a show that glamorizes the inner workings of an inhuman monster, such as Dahmer.

That being said, this show did the opposite, in my opinion! It emphasized the humanity of the victims and anyone else whom this sorry cretin's actions directly affected - one of the most compelling being Nicey Nash's Glenda Cleveland.

I remember reading about this case and being struck by how much of a badass Cleveland was and Nash did not disappoint. Her performance immortalizes a woman whose strength never dwindled, not even in the face of pure evil."
1.0,28 September 2024,"I was a fan of season 1, I really enjoyed it.

But season 2 is the opposite. Boring and one of those shows you just want to jump to the last episode and get done with it. Nothing new come from the next episode, just more of the same boring stuff and no plot twist to keep you wanting to watch. It's a shame, and I really hope season 3, if there is one, to be better and the quality to be what we got from season 1.

There were so many ways they could have gone about it, or probably not, probably the story was as boring as season 2 shows us. I enjoy crime tv, but I feel this was just a waist of time. Don't recommend season 2 at all."
2.0,25 September 2022,"Good acting, but the snail's pace is unnecessary and inexcusable. I was bored stiff in the middle of the second episode. A non fiction movie/show/book should give you some informational takeaways but after an hour and a half I only learned that an opossum is the only marsupial in North America. I turned it off and decided to refresh my memory of the events with a quick read on Wikipedia and then I moved on to something more entertaining. BTW I thought the John Wayne Gacy mini series was great, and could have been a guide to make this more educational and interesting. Don't waste ten hours on this one."
5.0,11 November 2022,"I found this show incredibly compelling, but I wasn't a fan of the fact that multiple elements of racism and corrupt police officers were present in the show, despite being inaccurate from real life. It's clear that Netflix was trying to satisfy an agenda, and I didn't like that, but I will say that I enjoyed watching the show. It's just that all the parts I found to be the most frustrating in terms of the police's actions all never happened or were significantly embellished-which I was bothered to find out later but ultimately not surprised that Netflix would add in those things to make the story seem worse than it really was."
1.0,10 October 2022,"The first 7 or 8 episodes were great. They weee pretty accurate with reality and suspenseful. The last two - three episodes were not inline with reality. They were slow paced, portrayed added drama and did not reflect true events. The last episode in particular did not even portray Dahmer's death in the way that it happened. Where was the person who witnessed it and later drew the infamous drawing. Why did the death of Dahmer not match the drawing or countless other true documentaries made on the topic.

This should not be called a documenseries. This should just be called a drama based loosely on real events."
2.0,23 October 2022,
3.0,13 October 2022,"This is probably one of the most annoying/boring series I've watched in a long time.

The acting is at times fairly good but the story line jumping back and forth is infuriating, slow and doesn't even make sense.

To make it worse the facts are amazingly inaccurate and overdramatised.

Netflix at it again! Their obsession with the racism card is downright nauseating. It's getting boring now as is this series.

I couldn't even get through the whole show as it just got more and more annoying. Really do yourself a favour and give this show a miss. What were the writers thinking when they put this together?"
1.0,4 October 2022,"The Jeffery Dahmer story was a very disturbing story to hear as it happened and I was hesitant to watch this series because I was resistant to relive this reality. Unfortunately for the viewers, the writers decided that dragging the story out was better than giving a concise narrative of actual events.

From my recollection, every storyline was accurately told in this series. However, I my opinion, repeatedly telling the side of the victim and their families takes away from the fact that Jeffery Dahmer was a demonic person. The victim storyline, while extremely accurate, gave the writers to attempt to show Dahmer as a sympathetic individual...which he was not.

The writers/producers at Netflix need to realize that fewer episodes with a good story is better than extra episodes with a dragged out storyline. The Dahmer story could have been told in 4 well written episodes...with better reviews."
5.0,26 September 2022,"Thought it was going to be based on the facts but it wanders off all over the place. A hard slog through some pointless scenes. Political, social issues thrown in which turn it into something else. I'm not sure what it was meant to be. Waded through it as I'd started it but was a most unpleasant and boring in parts, story that has been better told. I also read that the relatives of the victims were very unhappy to have the series made. Some good acting that's about it. I really wouldn't bother - the last couple of episodes are all over the place and a total waste of 2 hours of your time.

Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. Even the title of the show is too long. How can they make ten one hour shows about this man? I read a biography of Dahmer several years ago and while the main points of this show are true, there's an awful lot of padding in there too. The show is slow, boring and lacks focus. It jumps around between time periods, one scene is Dahmer as a young boy, the next as a man, then back to being a young boy again. It's not good story telling. I only started watching after I saw the trailer with Richard Jenkins but after three episodes I don't think I'll stick with it."
2.0,25 September 2022,"If you're on the fence about watching this, just don't. Go for a walk, donate to charity, sing a song, ask someone out for a drink, but do yourself a favour & don't watch this misery fest. I realised I actually felt disgust watching this, but not in an entertaining way, it's just misery/ horror porn & that is a bad thing!

They also seem to be making it, right from the very first words, about racism, which is just laughable 2020 stuff, as if there isn't enough of that already, let's stoke up more trouble, the producers say to themselves, how helpful of them!!!

It's also boring & just left me feeling dirty, there is absolutely no point in polluting your brain with this grime. I think I might watch Mary Poppins instead."

The framing of who the real 'monsters' are is inconsistent to the point where I can't determine what Ryan Murphy wanted to accomplish with it. Did he want the viewers to side with the brothers or the parents? Did he want them to side with anyone?

In one episode Erik and Lyle are presented to be sympathetic to the viewer, like the scene with Lyle and Jose at the cemetery, with Jose shouting at Lyle for his suspension from Princeton, stating he is unworthy of being buried among other successful figures, and cruelly comparing his 'disobedience' to their dog. Yet in another episode we're shown Jose's perspective, in which Lyle's academic misconduct is what thwarted his latest attempt at 'mending' the family. As if that justifies his behaviour.

The last episode is the worst, however. The viewers are positioned to feel sad when Erik and Lyle receive their life sentences, get sent to separate prisons, and their vans part ways. But then there's a cut back to a conversation on the fishing trip, where they evilly conspire to murder their naive parents. I say naive because on the other side of the boat, Jose and Kitty are framed as totally normal, saying 'I love you' and discussing their future plans as a wholesome, happy couple."
5.0,22 October 2022,"Meets somebody,kills them then cuts them up while neighbours complain about the smell. This goes on for about 6 episodes. Once he get's caught it's all about the effect on the victims families. I had never heard of this guy but he is one of many serial killers currently being celebrated on Netflix . Stay awake at the back if you can. Fine performance by the guy who plays his father.

Could have been wrapped up inside 4hours. Definitely no Mindhunter. What happened to that excellent and involving series?

Lots of standard issue bleating about the racism and homophobia which seems to be rife in that country, but all in all fairly predictable stuff and very drawn out."
2.0,25 September 2022,"I love Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins, and most seasons of American Crime Story so I had such high hopes for this, but after 30 minutes of the first episode, I just had to throw in the towel and give up.

First- why change the pertinent facts of the story? There's plenty of detail and facts surrounding this entire case that are interesting and worthy of being portrayed, so I fail to see what exactly demanded such ridiculous story arcs that make no sense? This was incredibly loosely based on facts.

Second- what is it with the obsession with dark, grainy, shaky cameras? It's not artsy or edgy and makes nothing more interesting. If anything it gives the feeling of nausea. Stop it. It wasn't good when it was first demonstrated, and no matter how many people use it with their own interpretation, it doesn't get better.

Lastly, the victims are still victims. From all accounts, none ever egged him on, at least not in the manner in which the writers suggest- so much so that many victim's families are considering suits. I sincerely hope they're successful and Murphy can knock it off with his odd obsession with twists that make victims look stupid and like they're asking for it.

If anyone in Hollywood even still cares what the average audience cares, listen to us when we tell you we've had our complete fill of Ryan Murphy- stop giving him money for nonsense."
3.0,1 October 2022,"Yet another show glorifying Dahmer. Meanwhile, the victims' families have again stated in the news how traumatic this is for them, and that they feel like they can't escape the horrors of what their loved ones went through because of privileged white folks hell-bent on making shows/movies about serial killers.

An important point one of the victim's families made recently was that if the show (Netflix) actually cared about the victims (as they claimed to) then they would have consulted with the families first - they didn't consult with any of the victims' families. Additionally, Netflix could have donated a significant portion to relevant charities, but they didn't.

Teenage me would have found this interesting. However, adult me - who has witnessed dying and the aftermath of violent deaths - can only feel truly heartbroken for the victims' family members. How disgusting it is that we live in a culture that glorifies mentally ill individuals and disregards the suffering that the victims endured, and their families will remember forever."

5.0,3 October 2022,"One thing I'm not to fond of as you finish this series you really don't think of Jeff as a horrible individual. It's persuasive into making you think he's not such a bad guy that he just had a bad life and so on. It almost makes you feel sorry for the guy. But that's little to no excuse for doing all he did. It's a very interesting series don't get me wrong. But I feel like this was almost made to honor him.... Not make him look like the evil fool he actually is. Even though I enjoyed this series quite a bit, I'd probably prefer it wasn't made due to it giving him a positive-ish presentation. Works in a similar manner to those action movies that somehow get your routing for the bad guys."
4.0,25 September 2022,"I get that Netflix doesn't legally have to contact the victims families, but they should have. They're reliving this tragedy every single time something about Dahmer is created. Let them mourn in peace, stop being a part of their trauma just to put money in your pockets.

As for Evan Peters, I've always been a huge fan. I'm disappointed to know that you didn't reach out to any of the families before portraying this monster. I know he's not the first and unfortunately he won't be the last.

Moral of the story.. contact the families and receive their blessings before you give these monsters anymore attention.

To the victims and their families, I am truly sorry.

You deserve better. You deserve peace."
4.0,6 October 2024,"The actors were good, but I just don't understand why Ryan included so many lies in the story. He said it's based on a true story, so why not make it accurate? Erik and Lyle aren't the monsters he made them out to be. I watched the court proceedings, and there were so many people who supported them and explained their side. But in the series, Ryan only focused on the hate and made them look worse. It feels like he left out a lot of important details just to push a negative view. If the story is supposed to be based on real events, then it should show both sides, not just the bad stuff. It doesn't seem fair or honest to only tell part of the truth."
1.0,11 December 2022,"The acting and how he lures his victims is what's good.

Half of the runtime is filler material which is made up by the writers because the families of the victims didn't respond to the Ryan Murphy when he wanted more info. So he basically made money off the victims while not giving their families anything.

Then he has the audacity to blame racism, homophobia and white privilege for what happened throughout the second half of the series. It's disingenuous, immoral and criminal.

I don't have the character count to rip apart all the lies in the series but please look it up to see for urselves."
1.0,2 October 2022,"What a let down! Me & the wife tried watching this last night & somehow we made it to the end of episode 2 & that was us done! If you like people staring at the camera for an hour, walking down corridors in slow motion, useless brain-dead neighbours, useless brain-dead cops & useless brain-dead victims then you'll probably love it but it bored us to tears. All I wanted to do was get into our TV & put rockets up everyone's backsides & not in slow-mo !!

After 2 episodes my wife started watching something on her tablet so I took the dog for a walk in the dark hoping to bump into Jeffrey Dahmer so I could run rings around him. I only added the last bit because for some reason my review HAD to be 600; characters but I could have summed this up with 1 word - 'BORING'"
1.0,23 September 2022,"This show would be a lot better if it was maybe 5 episodes as opposed to 10. Even the series itself seems to be bored with itself by episode 6 or 7. Ultimately I regret starting the series but it had a lot of potential.

It's also one of those shows where's it's difficult to tell what's based on reality and what isn't. If you're making something for entertainment make it entertaining. If it's supposed to be a historical account a google search shouldn't reveal immediate fabrications to the story.

Great performance by the lead and dad role though. The dad especially does some really nuanced work that's worth seeing."
3.0,28 September 2022,"You don't have consent from the victims nor their families why would you make this, why would you show pictures? Just why? Not to mention you got some stuff wrong how are you going to tell some thing that really happened and get details wrong, again why would you make this?

Like think about how the families of the victims feel having to see every decade and you bad Netflix documentary made about how their family member was killed🙁

not to mention sick lowlifes on the Internet are using this as an opportunity to sympathize with Jeffrey Dahmer, I seen people say ""it was an accident"" how do you accidentally kill 17 people? Or other people being like ""he's a good guy"" be serious, be so serious

it makes me angry the fact that people are sympathizing with a serial killer and finding them attractive, it's just weird and it makes me so angry, how do you think the families feel having people call the person who murdered their child attractive?

But yeah seriously don't watch this, out of respect for the victims and The family members of the victims."
3.0,23 September 2024,"I always love to binge on Ryan Murphy's anthology series. I was looking so forward to seeing Nicholas Chavez, who is so wonderful on General Hospital and it's very missed. He is such a great actor, but the show was tedious at best while the actors all gave really good performances, especially the actress that played the brothers. Chloe Sevigny was completely wasted with her talents. She played such a despicable character and brought out absolutely no emotional feeling same with Bardem.

The actress that played the attorney was wonderful. There's no spoilers because we know how it all turns out but my opinion don't waste nine hours of your time watch the first episode the fifth episode and the last episode because every episode has flashbacks."
1.0,5 October 2022,"The story is interesting (of course, is the Jeffrey Dahmer story) but they made it extremely slow. There are parts that literally nothing happens for 10 minutes. Is such a rich, disturbing and full of details story and yet this is so boring. I found myself fast forwarding for most parts of the episodes hoping for an interesting scene. Dialogs are vague, monotone and boring. They don't go in depth about any part of his psyche (only 1 but not going to spoil it). I have seeing documentaries about Dahmer that the duration is 1 hour and have more details and information about him that this entire series.

Totally over rated."
4.0,29 September 2022,"The pacing is weird, the storytelling is not as witty as they think it is. They give us easy answers to something, that's not that easy to explain, but hey, the Zeitgeist has its narratives which need to be told so the woke & co. Can feel cool. And then they add some gruesome scenes, so the little girls with their blue-orange hair have something to watch through their fingers. That's the formula.

And how unbelievably cynical is episode 9 in regards to the victims families? Is this Netflix being selfcritical or just blatantly ignorant? Totally insane to me. I hope Jennifer Lynch (who I like) slipped that in to diss Netflix.

The series shows some scenes that give us leads to thr eventual making of more serial killer sequels (a series about Gein? Gacy? Please spare us). Where are the woke people now, complaining about injustice? Write some mails to Netflix how traumatizing the series is for all the victim's families."
5.0,22 September 2022,"Realizing this is called Jeffrey Dahmer: Monster, Evan Peters, who is producer Ryan Murphy's own personal go-to pawn, ala Malcolm McDowell from Clockwork Orange, seems to be literally playing a monster, and a brain-dead zombie at that...

To think all those gay men were picked up on, and allowed themselves to be taken to the apartment of, a guy who could hardly function, could hardly even walk down the street without seeming like he's about to burst... A guy so monotone, robotic and sleazy anyone with a brain would run the opposite direction...

That's how Peters decided to play an actual non-fiction person, who was, indeed, a human monster, but the monster comes from what he did when he got what he wanted and was able to DO what he wanted...

But the problem here is there's no character-arc for Dahmner... He starts out a droning freak and winds up the same way... As for his accent, it seems unnatural and put-on... performed...

Meanwhile the pace doesn't flow; it's a real slog to get through.... There are so many interesting aspects of Dahmer's life to be studied, to experience, and yet the entire thing feels like it's deliberately slow-motion-arthouse-weird for the sake of style instead of substance...

Through school, through the army, through gay bar hookups, through everything in Dahmer's entire life including interrogation, he's a one-dimensional cardboard-cutout of how a novice acting student would IMAGINE a crazy person to be...

And many good reviews are noting how off-putting and creepy this is, but... if everything's off-putting, what's there to compare it with? In fact, most of the other characters, from his victims to bosses to the police and especially Richard Jenkins as his dad, are equally as stone-faced and drowsy...

Overall, MONSTER is more like another chapter of American Horror Story instead of an actual serial killer biopic... and those can be amazing, but Ryan Murphy and his boy are too stuck in their usual pretentious rut to let an actual story (of an actual person) shine through."
5.0,13 November 2022,"The first 5 episodes are well-acted, interesting and engaging. Often difficult to watch, of course, due to the extreme sickness of the crimes, but still very well done.

Starting around episode 5 or 6, it completely turns into yet another woke-O-rama, The big difference between this and all the others with the same agenda is the ridiculous, over-the-top, almost cartoonish caricaturing of an entire race/culture. Every member of this particular race/culture (save for one priest) is depicted as horrible, evil, selfish, arrogant, racist, corrupt, and just plain bad (yes, ALL of them). EVERY member of all other races/cultures are depicted as decent, moral, ethical, kind, caring, sensible, and just plain good (yes, ALL of them). The ONLY exception in the entire series was a priest, and possibly Lionel Dahmer and Chief Arreola (although he was depicted doing the right thing ONLY because of public pressure). I have no problem with showing the truth, warts and all, as that is very necessary to tell the whole story. It's just that it turned into a clumsy, almost laughably obvious attempt at depicting ALL people of one race/culture as evil. Even all the minor characters from this particular race/culture are slimeballs - according to Netflix.

There's almost no other way to describe the last five or six episodes as anything other than racist propaganda."
3.0,29 September 2022,"It's the same Dahmer dreck you've seen 100 times before. You watch anything from Ryan Murphy? You watch the same Dahmer stuff over and over again? Then you know what you're getting into, except it's NINE HOURS long. Seeing these reviews that the ""cinematography is exquisite"" makes me laugh. These people wouldn't know good from bad CinEmAtOgRapHy if it knocked on their door. This country's fascination with these terrible people will never cease to amaze me. Why does this need to be told? AGAIN? Yeah, let's keep making these families relive the absolute terror they went through so Evan Peters can WiN aLl tHe AwRdS.

This show is gross. Period. Full stop.

This genre of exploitative fiction, passing for non fiction is disgusting, it should be criminal. To force victims to relive this is ridiculous, all to turn a buck. It's gross.... if you support it, you are to blame.

Stop watching this stuff, you want True Crime, watch that... to fictionalize it is disgusting, it's tabloid level garbage.

This whole thing is incessant, we are getting non stop shows that attempt to dramatize fiction with no care to the victims, or truth.

STOP WATCHING THIS DRIVEL."
1.0,25 September 2022,"Last night we decided to give the new Netflix series Dahmer a chance.

Rather reluctantly at first; the subject matter is not exactly ""nice"" viewing. If it were going to be a bloodbath, it would have been a no-go.

But it is instead a dark, brooding psychological study. Well scripted, directed, and acted; it is a superior crime drama, all told.

Evan Peters in the title role is crazy good. He completely captures the strangeness and unease of Dahmer.

However. Peters is not believable in looks as someone who had the power to lure men to his place. His face is hard and rather homely. You see in the early 80s mug shots the real Dahmer who had borderline blond porn-star looks, a kind of facial prettiness that could plausibly be a ""bait"" snare.

It is a crucial point - believability.

Still, the series is enormously compelling, and the back story really provides much."
3.0,27 September 2022,"If you already know the story and details about Jeff Dahmer this series might bore you. A few hour long youtube documentaries can pretty much cover everything. Their idea to bounce off different timelines from childhood, adulthood, victims etc and vice versa reminded me of Marvel's Eternals ... the trend of applying too many flashbacks and fast forwards is a terrible story telling method.

His childhood and family history is interesting though together with the rest of the grieving victims, should be good for about 5-6 episodes... the rest of the series are just unnecessary fluff ... they keep on going back to the victims and eyewitnesses even after we already established their part in the story. And by adding more stuff it feels kinda low-key glorifying the serial killer.

Not sure about the accuracy of this series, I'm sure the directors/writers applied many forms of artistic license to add more drama."
5.0,30 September 2024,"I could have titled this review Beating A Dead Horse. The first few episodes were very watchable, but by the 5th or so episode, we see and hear the same things over and over again in detail that makes you want to fast forward to get to the point of it. Maybe this is because this is a story that has already been well documented for the public, but to spend whole episodes on one thing is pushing the envelope of my attention span. Unless you are some kind of scholar wanting to write a dissertation where you want to know ever tiny bit of minutia, a large amount of it seems like filler to have extra episodes. The production quality was very good and the actors were watchable and did a good job. It just seemed like it could have been several episodes shorter."
1.0,21 September 2022,"Very slow series, Netflix should have just put the money into more seasons of Mindhunters. They had us on the very edge of our seats.

It only has stars for Peter Evans and the very brief scenes of Niecy Nash.

I also would appreciate it if someone could, for once, just make a film that is in order. Do we really have to start at the end and then jump around?

Apparently my review is too short so I'm just going to use the text suggestion is to be a good time to talk to you and your family and friends say that I have a great day and I will have to be a good time to talk to

Ok sorry for that. Enjoy."
1.0,29 October 2022,"There has to be something more usefull and meaningfull to spend money on making movies about, than making criminals and murderers into some kind of cinemagraphic heroes (or anti-heroes).

It's not good making movies about war's or other vile behaviors, but lately it has been somewhat of a trend in portraying criminals and murderers in particular.

Is it really the only way that an actor of today can do some method-acting, then I am feeling very sorry for the future of the whole industry.

This movie is not worth even giving a rating, but sadly 1 is the lowest that is available. I would hope we don't get to see this on the Oscars or I would say that the industry have sunken lower than even the real Titanic managed to do."
2.0,6 October 2024,"Watch anything about these boys and their story...but not this dramatized garbage. There is no substance to the show other than the maker of movies and American horror story episodes going on a series of completely fictional moments and scenes.

Literally the opening of the show is a conversation / interaction with the boys that no one could possibly know about. Their actions and dialogue is damning for them and there is zero credibility to the scene as there were no witnesses or recordings. The only possible reason is sensationalism and ratings.

This show does a disservice to the truth and should be ashamed."
5.0,15 December 2022,"One of the ugliest movie ever. Dumb story of a stupid and sick person. I would never thought that this story can be interesting to a such big amount of people. And don't even think to watch it with you girlfriend, I bet you won't have sex for days after such an ugly trash. I understand that it is based on a true story, but I can hardly believe to the events are shown. I didn't find anything new to know, and didn't get any satisfaction after watching it. For me it was just a waste of time. Do not recommend anyone to watch. Extremely overrated movie. I was shocked to see over 7 points on IMDB rating."
4.0,4 October 2024,"First season was exceptional. It was tense, well-written, well-casted. I gave it 9 stars and were recommending it to everyone.

I'm not going to complain about how inaccurate the second season is. This is not a documentary, this is storytelling and the cast was very promising. I've been watching Ryan Murphy's other projects and I am accustomed to his style. But this time the script is filled with unnecessarily long monologues that don't fit in any dramatic context. The editing does not make any sense. The actors are almost goofy in what was supposed to be very deep. It should have taken 4-5 episodes. Maybe then it would have made sense.

What is worse is that because of season 2, the rating for season 1 is getting affected. It is unfair. That's why I'm lowering it to only 3, whereas to 1."
4.0,12 October 2022,
1.0,21 September 2024,"The amount of shouting in the Menendez season is just ridiculous. Yelling does not make you a good actor. No one seems to understand what overacting is anymore. The guy playing Lyle feels like he's trying to channel Wahlberg's cocaine binge in Boogie Nights, except throughout the whole series.

And it's not only these actors, it's everyone in the series. Almost every scene starts out with a quiet conversation and progressivle goes to shouting like clockwork. Come on.

Such a waste of time. The first season about Dahmer was a million times better. No overacting nonsense.

Also what is the deal with series now having a different director for each episode? Ruins any style or vision that one director has, and feels all over the place."
1.0,2 October 2022,
5.0,16 October 2022,"This is not the sort of series I generally give a 5. Normally, this would be a 6 or a 7. The cinematography is competent, sometimes good. The production and art design is generally pretty good. The writing is more than adequate, it satisfies and more. The performances are probably the best part, they're actually very compelling; in fact, my curiosity tp see Evan Peters in this role is the only reason I gave Dahmer a shot. But, I digress: shows with above average quality normally get an above average rating from me, except in cases where the show had a damaging effect on the world (for example, the South Park episode that accidentally created gingerism), or which deal with sensitive subject matter insensitively and without a necessary level of tact.

Dahmer uses the story of Jeffrey Dahmer for a sensational story with a famous serial killer name brand for extra viewership, but the show never deals with or addresses the effects it might have on the living victims and family of the man himself. I didn't realize this when I started the show, and didn't think too research until halfway through, that Jeffrey Dahmer's parents may still be alive. His father is. I don't know about you, but having seen the series and it's portrayal of Lionel Dahmer, I don't like that one bit. The series never talked to the victims' relatives, either. That's my main issue, but it's a big one. I don't think that you could, in good conscience, make a biopic about a serial killer without talking to the people who live with that trauma every day. It's disrespectful.

As well, I think that the changes made to the true story were often morally questionable, such as the depiction of Steven Hicks' murder, which was made significantly less egregious and unjustifiable than the true story. It's not like they made it seem reasonable; but certainly less deranged and much more understandable given the context. I think that the gruesome and horrifying details this show occasionally decides to dance around would make an equally compelling story that the semi truth they choose to tell, and therefore I cannot see any good reason behind it. Even more egregious is the fictional depiction of Jeffrey Dahmer and Tony Hughes as having a reltionship, when in fact Tony was killed just like all the others: the night they met Jeffrey. I found this fabricated friendship between the two to be grossly inappropriate and wholly unnecessary. They could have invented a fake person, instead of distorting the image and life of a real human victim.

I have no doubt this story was made with the victims at it's heart, but many questionable choices were made that seem antithetical to that heart. As well, the show was kind of boring toward the end, so yeah. 5/10."
4.0,5 January 2023,
3.0,12 March 2023,"This show is riddled with embellishments, inaccuracies, and a blended main character (Glenda). This dramatization stokes an unwarranted racial fire. It is seemingly passed off as a documentary, and judging by numerous reviews, it does so quite successfully.

According to articles written after the release, the families of key victims were never consulted. While trying to fact check things such as the sandwich after eviction, Dahmer's father teaching him about roadkill, and several other head scratchers that I did not recall following the actual event and initial coverage, I was disappointed to find out these were fabricated or greatly exaggerated details.

But at least the dad from Step Brothers and Molly Ringwald were in it."

1.0,2 October 2022,"This is not a series about gruesome madness of Jeffrey Dahmer. Instead its about social injustice an inequality. Also the story is way more focused (probably about 80/20) on his sexual preferences rather than crimes.

In many episodes Dahmer is actually a supporting character and what you watch instead is his father or neighbor or somebody else. And often what they do adds nothing to the story but what those characters are used for is to show creators perspective on story/society/life.

As a movie it may be ok, but if you take story about an such unspeakable madness and terror I'm not sure you should water it down and try to make movie for everyone."
5.0,3 October 2022,"Every episode is like 1 hour, initially thought director want to build the character and want the viewers to understand those characters and personalities, but slow narration on every episode is making us not to watch the show anymore, may be 35-40mins max runtime per episode would make this show one of the best.

Positive: Story, casting, cinematography

Negative: screenplay, direction.

If netflix has an option to trim the episodes and re-release later then it would be wonderful. There is no point to view the series without suspense. Slow Screenplay on every scene on every episode is so boring."
3.0,23 September 2022,This show is absolutely disgusting it is only one of two movies in my entire life that have made me ill. I have a great stomach for dark and disturbing films but this is so graphic I almost wanted to vomit and the police are portrayed as a complete idiots who did not stop the situation when they could have under many circumstances. I don't think they should be allowed to air this show because it's not good for anybody and only ignites those that are inclined to enjoy it. I will say that the acting was good and Dahmer's growing up and past we're rough but we've all had rough upbringings and haven't turned out like that. I don't think they should validate his actions by a bad upbringing.
5.0,2 October 2022,"Just because Dahmer was gay does not mean that his story needed a major Ryan Murphy treatment. This retelling of the life of the infamous gay white serial killer through the white lens of Dahmer and Murphy was repugnant in its grotesque insensitivity to the victims of colour, their families, and the gay men of colour who to this day remain vulnerable members of the white-dominated gay community.

Casting Dahmer so centrally in this bloated 10-episode biopic is a reminder of how disposable and unimportant his mostly ethnic victims were. Why did he not target more gay white men? Ostensibly because they were not as marginalised as his non-white victims were. Gay people of colour remain cheap commodities for gay white men who could not hack it with their own kind. When gay white men like Murphy produce and endorse shows like these, they only increase the sexual dominance and capital of gay white men. Gay men of colour become vulnerable to opportunists like Dahmer precisely because most gay white men are still not progressive enough to date outside their own race."
3.0,2 November 2022,"Never heard of the actual true case and seriously I wish I just saw one of those shows. Here are my reasons SO SLOW.. painful to watch sooooooooo bad editing and script. But I guess 10 episodes are more money than 6.

Nothing new in terms of directing/music/colour/acting (yes, acting too. The characters are not so deep and difficult, especially for professional actors) The cinematography is boring. Just because its 80's doesn't mean it has to be yhe same pale/warm glowing dirty colours. Next time use your creativity people.

I hope one day Netflix realises that quality is more important than money.

P.s. Stope the woke propaganda."
1.0,19 September 2024,"In Murphy fashion, he definitely takes obscure actors and gives them the opportunity to show their greatness. Excellent acting by the two leads but the material is boring and drawn out. Season 2 seems more like it's being used as a case for a lesser sentence of manslaughter rather than murder. I dare say a cry to get the Menendez out of jail. I have no doubt these guys had a very difficult upbringing, but unfortunately, it's nothing that many other children before and after them have experienced. How many of those children killed their parents with 16 shots from shotguns?

There are some interesting side stories but not enough to keep me from fast forwarding many scenes. So, for me, this season is just ok. But in Murphy's defense, this season should not be compared to season one. The Menendez brothers are sociopaths who decided they wanted freedom from their parents and live the high life with their money. Dahmer is a whole other level of evil, and Evan Peters is ridiculously talented."
5.0,21 September 2022,"Ryan Murphy is a prolific writer and maker of TV/Film. The problem is, there is no quality control. Just look at American Horror Story, some amazing starts to seasons and then it just coasts for 8 episodes until a finale. I would like Ryan to learn that less is more, maybe have a 3 one hour mini-season with a lot more quality rather than the bloated 10 episodes with not a lot going on.

Dahmer is coasting during the first episode, a lot of fat could have been cut from this entire season. Some of the real events seem to have been merged into others and the emphasis on the kitsch nature of the fashion is front and centre.

As usual, Style over Substance."

5.0,28 September 2022,"Somehow, I got through all ten episodes of this. Maybe because once I got through half of it, I was hoping to see justice served to the victims by the end. From the beginning of Dahmer's life, the dysfunctional family structure made its mark. From one episode to the next, we're left with the curiosity of how someone becomes this way, with each passing step of his life. We know the story but want to know the details that led to the final days of Dahmer's life. We get drawn into the emotion the families go through. However, in the end, what was I left with? I was left with a series that was heartbreaking, deplorable, sick, twisted, evil, deplorable, grotesque, and beyond human comprehension."
1.0,26 September 2022,"Just. Wow. I'm still shook. It took several days to watch this. If you can't/don't ""disconnect"" from the internet fir the roughly 10 hours this spans, then just watch Jeremy Renner or My Friend Dahmer & you'll get that part of the story. Taken in as a full 10 hours this became, for me, less than just about Jeffrey & more of an epic composition of stories of different people all of whom became caught up in the ensuing cat-5 this story would become. It becomes a commentary of humans & humanity. Of guilt vs shame vs apathy vs blame. Of religion and how humans view religion, regardless of affiliation, and use it in their own individual way to gain their perspective of their own world...of which, like it or mot, we are all a part of. My grand takeaway from this was rather...restrained? Dim? Hopeful? That time only ever moves forward as it creates and then erases mountains and that we are really just ""dust in the wind"" as time moves on & that good & well-intentioned people get tossed by the wayside in humanity's ever survival-of-the-fittest. I'm going to go hug my dog and cat now after a long, hot shower. If this doesn't sweep every major award category come award season, and not just for Peters (I cannot fathom how one falls into such a role so completely without carrying some if that funk with you for life) but the also the brilliant Niecy Nash then there truly is no redemption for us."
3.0,29 September 2022,"There are several cinematic/tv accounts of Dahmer's life and all are dogged by the 'director down the rabbit hole' syndrome this story seems to bring.

Though they have moments of clarity generally they then plod mechanically through the telling of a now well known story lacking fresh insight or perspective and already subject to wide exposure via documentary, books and news accounts.

There is this repeat failure to get inside the head of Dahmer. Confrontation with such a formidable obsticle causes alot of narrative shuffling and substituting which in the end fails the work as a whole with defeat often acknowldged via a cap donning to a percieved exceptionalism directors in the end attribute to Dahmer himself.

Dahmer Monster - initially tries to avoid this scenario but almost immediatly shows the tell tale signs of having completely failed in much the same way as previous works have.

The compulsion to tell Dahmer's story still exists because his story has still not been fully understood nor fully layed bare. It's this inticement which will ensure he remains subject matter for future story telling.

So how should a director tackle what still needs to be told in this story ? There are a couple of key methodologies required.

First, do not make up parts of the story which simply did not happen. Dahmer Monster does this endlessely and it's the reason the director/s have blocked their own way into Dahmer's mind creating for the most part a voyeuristic meditiation on the impenitrable. The Dahmer story is like theatrcial classics in this respect. When doing plays like Shakespeare or any number of operas you never cut or alter the story. You bring to the story new information and resonance and you find ways to weave it in so as to amplify what is already there. Dahmer Monster strays so far from this rule it's no wonder it's being percieved as exploitative.

Dahmer's story has many key sensationalist, indeed infamous moments which successive directors are both initially drawn to and then repelled by as increasingly entangled in this dychotomy, they end up creating pieces which are more about the neccessity of a visual moral ettiquette rather than Dahmer the subject. This is again detectable in Dahmer Monster.

It needs to be noted that Dahmer himself invented and directed his own narrative and emphasis of detail when he fully confessed his crimes. Dahmer's control of his exceptionalism as sensational curio remains dominant in tellings of his story to date. The benefit of the doubt remains entirely in tact. The surviving police, detectives, journalists and authors are relient on the same because their reputations and life's work is invested so absolutly in it.

But look more closely at the repeat absences, gaps, jumps, and skips which occur in the repeat telling of Dahmer's story and you begin to see what Dahmer chose not to promote in his own myth making.

There lies a chain of unexamined key events and it is these which will finally enable entry into Dahmer's mind. Listed below are some of those details which if re-arranged so as to consitute the main part of his early story at least, tell a different story, of slow, natural, agonising, morose, mundane, ugly , calculating corruption and failure which speaks far less of exceptionalism and more of similarity to others like him.

1. An established acute alcoholism, dependant on spirits like vodka by the age of 14 maintained by chronic bouts drinking secretly both in and out of school remains highly anomalous and entirely unexplored as the sensational visual drama it actually is.

2. The comorbidity of deviant masturbation coupled with an increasingly evident indication of being highly skilled in the killing of animals where both are associated with his hyper private world of animal disection. The latter is a classic symptom of pre homicidality and links hime to the assured confidence by which he assumes the postition of assailant to a local jogger. All together these suggest the ferment of a homicidal, necrophile mindset fulled by alcohol misuse and even intoxification by chemicals used to preserve animal parts to the extent that murder and disection were very much part of the sexually contempleative minde set at the point of his first murder. I.e. Dahmer didn't stumble a nieve innocent into murder, he slowely developed and nurtured a precocious necrophile intent from his early teens and therefore cunning and calculation formed much of his creating situations in which harm or murder might occur. This is really important to establish because it alters his own versions of future murders to come all of which he sees himself simply as a passive anassuming protagonist subject to impulses he remains unaware of.

3. There are repeats of gaps Dahmer himself set in his own story. The gaps of no mention of his relationship to sexual exhibitionism / flashing, a chronic activity for which he was prosecuted once but which he engaged with on numerous occassions, particually when stationed in the army in Germany. Dahmer Monster clumbsily attempts to 'interpret' this as a recall of his first victim Wicks. But actually it's much more likley that Dahmer's exhibitionism is constituted of a kind of display of exceptionalism and sense of being other worldly and able to access rules outside the norm. In short he's sticking 2 fingers at the world whilst at the same time presenting himself as a product of their society. There's alot to be teased out here and it's telling Dahmer makes no mention of it as part of his conffession.

4. New information arrives all the time as time passes. Today we know he sexually raped and abused his room mates in Germany over a period of time whilst consuming huge quantities of alcohol and engaging in sexual exhibitionism in the local town, partoicually towards mothers and children. We know one night he inexplicably returned to a party with blood spots after storming off in a rage. We also know that his discharge was in many respects a cover up. All of this is repeatedly absent from Dahmers myth. Why ? Because it again presents Dahmer as a methodical abuser, seeking pleasure in any kind of subversive abuse he was able to access.

5. We also now know after the shame of being discharged from the army he delayed return home to his father and Wick's body, by spending time in Miami living with an english girl he led into a discussion about marrying. She was to join him once he returned home. But he omits any detail about Miami what so ever. So there's alot to consider about what he's really up to and going through while he's in some sense hiding in the light of this woman's innocents of his true nature.

6. Crucially a key symbols is repeatedly misunderstood. The existance of Wick's stashed whole skeletal remains at his father's home during the entire time in the army and Miami. Wick's body was decapitated as part of an essentially immeidiate and precoious need to deviginise his necrophile sensabilites. After his near capture, the body has to have been presereved for a deeper reason. It's preservation has to have acted as both a deterrant and mutually a draw. The body drew him back because it punctuates the narrative of homicidal Dahmer. It haunts his time in the army and Miami. It dominates his persona when he returns home to his father, completely incapable of making personal choices to an exagerated degree. The final destrcution of Wick's bones is an important moment because it simultaneously marks a desire to erase his deeds whilst also expressing yet more of the creative potential for absolute power inherent in the experience of necrophillia.

What we have here are neccessary re-examinations of parts already presented. Sadly Dahmer: Monster fails to bring the focus and integrity required to animate these calcualtingly ommited parts. It's noted that all this has occured by the time Dahmer is only 21 years old. He hasn't even began his killing career.

When it comes to his preented 2nd killing, in Dahmer's version the precise moment his serial killing career begins, at the Ambassador hotel the excepted narrative has to change. Dahmer presents as a highly proficient serial drug rapist who without knowing it 'accidentally' beat Tuomi to death. However if you alter the historical narrative by filling in gaps, Dahmer is transformed into a repeat perfecting and rehursing homicidal necrophile who has to some degree planned for the moment of murder. From that point on Dahmer's precocious proffessionalism is maintained as a central aspect of his decent into lustful oblivion. But the mess of rising frenzy isn't reflective of that fallacy. The penultimate frenzy arisies from the conflict which arises in the face of an absolute degree of satation of desire not in a dissacoated amateur and unaware mindset.

It's this absolute control of the accepted narrative Dahmer still has over the way he is presented as a protagonist in his own story which needs to be challenged and which remains frustratingly intact given the arrival of Dahmer Monster. Somebody must bring him down. The exceptionalism here lies not in Dahmer but in Society's capacity to examine an emerging, common understanding of taboo desires as they exist across those who have them."
5.0,25 November 2022,"The highlight of the series is Richard Jenkins, playing the conflicted father who can't help loving his son no matter what dark deeds he has done. Other than that, things started off fine but slowly went downhill with more and more of the usual propaganda we get nowadays. What I found particularly irritating is a majority of the final few episodes features more and more of the supposed woman neighbour of Dahmer going through a lot of emotional ""pain"" and trauma, but she wasn't even a victim nor had any of her family or friends killed by Dahmer. What is this.. some kind of vicarious victimhood? Why spend so much time on her rather than on the actual victims' families who suffered real loss? I think this is very disrespectful and deserves to be roundly criticised."
1.0,20 September 2024,"Overly drawn out cringe drama. The actors are bad in my opinion. The music is awful throughout. If that's true that they were that obsessed with Milli Vanilli, who didn't even sing their own songs, no wonder the brothers ended up where they were haha. Save yourself the bother of watching and watch the many high quality documentaries and interviews on YouTube. I can't believe Netflix made that many episodes on this! 9 episodes that are an hour long at least! It would've been better to make it into an hour and a half movie. I didn't like it from the first episode and am just about going to give up watching it at the end of episode 2 😂 To me this is one of the most disappointing (overly) dramatised productions Netflix has ever and over done."

I honest to God do not care if Jeffrey had a bad childhood he's a serial killer, there are people out there who had worst childhood and aren't serial killers, people are using this as an opportunity to feel empathy for him and to find him attractive he sexually assaulted then murdered two minors, i've seen people say ""it was an accident"" you don't kill 17 people on accident. Not to mention the families of the victims were very uncomfortable by this. Do not watch this, i'm waiting for the day we stop using a serial killers childhood as a way to excuse what they did.

3.0,10 January 2023,"First and foremost .. peters is great but there is something missing in his performance or to be more exact he wasn't given much to go with probably because the script kinda seems weak most of the time..

they stretched it over 10 episodes which are way too many.. this is a problem with most tv shows nowadays.

Trying to squeeze what is essentially a movie plot into 6 to 10 episodes which sometimes just kills what would have been some otherwise more entertaining content.

For the most part the series is well made. Some stuff is accurate. Most isn't. I read that the real JD was a different kind of character from people who watched some interviews from way back when, but who knows what he was really like..

BTW this is nowhere near the quality of Mindhunter as some here are suggesting .. it's rather mediocre due to the already mentioned flaws. All in all somewhat entertaining but mostly average 5.0/10."
3.0,27 September 2022,"Directing ,styling cinematography all on point ,but we're not gonna sit here and act like telling this story (the way Netflix ended up with anyways) was anywhere near ethical nor right ..this was disrespectful ,to the victims ,families ,and dare I say ,to the audience as well.

Netflix wanted to make a show to get us to try and understand why he was the way he was ,but in the same breath wanted us to sympathize with him ,F Netflix, and everyone involved in this.

All that being said ,6 ep wrecked my heart ,his victim in this one was handicapped, he didn't deserve this ,I hope his soul is resting well!"
1.0,6 December 2022,Evan Peters' performance is outstanding. His versatility as an actor is on full display. There are some scenes that are difficult to watch because they are so disturbing. I was glued to this series the first few episodes but the tone and pace changes about halfway through and my interest level dropped. The jumping from scene to scene started making it hard to keep my attention. What really made me lose interest is when it the story line went woke. It was just an unnecessary element to the story as well as inaccurate. The last few episodes are complete duds as well. The documentary on Netflix is much better in my opinion.

4.0,25 September 2022,"It is traumatizing enough reading about what Jefferey Dahmer did, why do we need a series on it? I don't understand the purpose of this at all. I don't think something this disturbing and disgusting should be made into a series no matter how good the filming or acting is. There is no happy ending to this, so many people suffered and lost their lives horrifically. And to act out what had happened to real victims feels like they are taking things way too far - this is not exactly a documentary. This is some form of sick 'entertainment'. It feels insensitive and unnecessary and I just feel shocked, angry and frustrated that this has been created."
1.0,26 September 2022,"This show was way too drawn out. Did we really need 10 almost 1 hour long episodes? This series should have been trimmed to a maximum of six episodes. I am noticing this trend with these true-life crime dramas to extended them well beyond what the story structure can support (Under the Banner of Heaven, The Staircase to name some recent few) which results in the series plodding along with a lot of dead time instead of being a tight, brisk and thrilling watch.

While I enjoyed it, I thought Evan Peters performance of Dahmer was very one note and a bit of a disappointment to be honest. For me Richard Jenkins as Lionel Dahmer quietly steals the show. Niecy Nash also gives an honest and enjoyable performance as Glenda Cleaveland, Dahmer's next door neighbor who had to put up with all the smells and noises coming from his apartment and who on many an occasion called the police because of the terrifying sounds she heard coming out of the grating that connected her apartment and his, but was simply ignored by the local police.

I will say Episode 6 was a punch to the gut though as they focus on one one of his victims, Tony Hughs, which was just heart-rending to watch. I found myself wanting to shout out at the screen to warn poor Tony once his path crossed with Dahmer's and so desperately wished for him to be one of those victims that managed to escape with their lives intact, but this was not to be the case.

One of the biggest sins this show commits (and one I am sure could have been alleviated with less episodes) is that it's boring and I am a true-life crime enthusiast. When you have your viewers falling asleep throughout the show (and during the day too since it was a daytime watch) about one of the most notorious and gruesome serial killers to have ever existed, then that tells you something is definitely wrong with the pacing of your show, as is evident here.

On a side bar note : - Why these people even went into a house/flat that smelled of rotting flesh is beyond me. Our bodies are hard-wired to be repulsed by that smell. Even if the bloke wasn't a serial killer, my hygiene buttons would have been pushed to their limits. There is no ways I would have stayed."
5.0,24 September 2022,"So far I've seen four episodes, overall I think it's too slow. There's already been so many works done on the Dahmer story. Capping this at four one-hour long episodes could have been accomplished.

The series is full of peaks and valleys, mostly the latter. I can't say it's a binge worthy series- usually I'm not eager to flip to the next episode right away (like I was with Netflix's ""You"" or Apple TV's ""Severance""). I think the camera work is astonishing and Evan Peters and Richard Jenkins do a good portrayal of Jeff and Lionel Dahmer respectively. It's definitely a grotesque and unpleasant series to watch, but it's tolerable in terms of Netflix content. I particularly like the scenes of Jeff speaking with the cops (while Jeff is pulled over and when they visit his apartment) and psychologist. This all helps us enter the deranged character's psyche.

The fervent interest in Dahmer's mental state, fetishes, and killings makes sense, but the creators are putting in too many extraneous details. We don't really need to see the Dahmer's before Jeff was born, Joyce Dahmer's work life or addiction, or Jeff's extended interactions with a mannequin or his erotic magazines. Those are just a few examples, but the constant oscillation of the time period can also get confusing. This simply wasn't streamlined and it's hard to tell what the focus is.

So I can recommend giving it a chance just for the shock factor. While it's not consistent in terms of excitement, there's some brilliant acting and dialogue."
2.0,23 September 2022,"I really wanted to 'enjoy' this, I've watched several documentaries about Dahmer so a series that focused on the victims was absolutely interesting to me as they are so often forgotten and I hoped this show would address WHY he was able to get away with it for so long but despite some excellent acting, beautiful cinematography and well handeled details of the murders - not overtly gruesome or gratuitous - the whole thing was like wading through treacle.

I will admit I threw in the towel halfway through the 4th episode.

The storyline was shot out of order for no particular reason I could decern which lead me wondering 'which victim is this'?, So much detail was poured in to his relationship with his parents or lack thereof, seriously the 'blame the parents' thing again? Were we meant to feel sorry for him?

Disappointing."
4.0,22 September 2022,"Sorry everyone, I can see this will be an unpopular opinion but I felt this series was incredibly slow paced.

I had to skip through so many slow, overly dragged out scenes. Example, Dahmer would meet someone new, and it would take a good 10-15 minutes to establish the purpose of where the encounter was heading.

Bearing in mind, he had many encounters and many victims to get through!

Maybe I was hoping for more focus to be on post-arrest. I would've like to see more interrogation.

Hearing his reasoning to the cops. But instead the majority was focused more on past events.

After all, this is a drama and not a true crime docuseries. So perhaps if you have a similar taste to me, this will feel slow to you too."
1.0,9 October 2022,"This type of series gives very disturbing ideas to mentally weak people, and then we are very surprised when it happens next to our door. We already live in a dangerous world, no need to film this kind of garbage or spend time , money to relate the life of a mentally sick man. What's the aim? The studios believe that the more it's disgusting, the more they're going to have audience. I'm sorry but they're wrong. And then you have Hollywood blaming Will Smith for what we did, but this was just a caress compared to that. Enough is enough. We have to spread peace & love. Have a great and happy day."
3.0,24 September 2022,"Acting great, screenplay horrible, direction unimaginative and boring. With everything that happened can't understand how they made this so dull. Was excited to see Evan Peters in another Ryan Murphy production, but this pandered to a simple audience. If you care about the victims, victims' families or their POV at all then do we REALLY have to see/be force-fed Dahmer's backstory? This could have been half the episodes because there's so much filler and even entire duplicate scenes in non-linear timelines. There are more clever cinematic ways for an audience to side with or 'get' a villain and attempting compassion for him ain't it. Don't bother!"

I'm heavily into true crime. I work in finance and I'm listening to podcasts all day to drown out all the background noise. So in saying all that, I'm admitting, this rating is SUBJECTIVE. This POS did not deserve this depiction. While I understand the deeper intentions and storytelling, I just can't get down with it. I applaud Evan's capability to dive so deeply into the character, I also sympathize with, what I can only imagine doing so, did to him on a human level... I just couldn't get through this or support it. These animals of our history do not deserve their legacy we allow them. Oxo."

2.0,15 October 2022,"I heard a lot about this show from people at work. They were all saying things like ""I had to turn it off or I wouldn't have slept that night"". So, when it got to the weekend, I sat down with my fiance, and we watched some of it... And it was boring.

Sure, it was well acted and they set it well in that time period, but... No.

The time jump all over the place just irritated me. I never like when shows do that. It makes it difficult to keep track of where you're supposed to be.

And probably the thing that took me out of it the most, was the families and the neighbours. This just highlighted it was a TV show and not a documentary. When they do a bit of a story showing a victim with the family, they always have the family SUPER nice and supportive of them. Not one of them ever had bad last words to their son/brother. Hardly realistic. Families argue all the time. It happens. Usually doesn't mean anything. But it would have been much more believable if the last words one of the siblings said was ""Remember you owe me $20!"" or ""Don't worry! I'll wash your dinner plates for you, shall I? Lazy!"" I know why they did it. It's to show how much they loved them, etc. But it means things have been changed. And now we can't accept anything as true. What else was changed?

I dunno. I'm not trying to sound unsympathetic... i just didn't get the hype for this show."
5.0,17 October 2022,"I saw 2 episodes and found that it was quite violent. Yes the engagement level is there but what about the disturbing visuals and story? This is not at all good for society I'm sorry to say. By showcasing such events unfolding, we are allowing others to see what can happen and what can be considered as somehow acceptable behaviour. Also if you're thinking, I'm being a SJW, let me just say even from a selfish point of view, I feel I don't want to let such disturbing visuals and narrative enter my mindset frame. Please be a little selfish of what you allow into your life, into your mind, into your bedroom. Life will give you a lot of good then."
5.0,21 September 2022,"The story is far too slow, not enough darkness and too many irrelevant stuffing scenes, i watched the whole thing and scrolled my phone for two whole episodes and missed NOTHING ...given that it is a short series they should have repackaged the story in a different eventful way where you get hooked not wanting to miss a single scene, the victims of Dhamer were too many and could have been utilized far too better than how they were for the story

Further, the music choices were not on par for the mood requirement of such series

All in all, so much thought and money was put up for this show and it is very clear. However, poorly put together and I wouldn't recommend it at all."
1.0,26 September 2024,"As a fan of true crime dramas, I was excited to see Ryan Murphy's take on the Menendez Brothers. However, I was left feeling frustrated and disappointed. Murphy's writing comes across as insensitive and overly sensationalized, relying on tired clichés that diminish the real complexity of the case. The portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters feels particularly one-dimensional, lacking the depth and nuance that they deserve. Instead of exploring the trauma and intricacies of the brothers' lives, the series seems more interested in shock value, leaving me feeling like I was watching a hollow spectacle rather than a thoughtful narrative. Overall, it's a missed opportunity that ultimately fails to engage meaningfully with its subjects."
1.0,21 September 2024,
2.0,11 October 2022,"The main problem with this series is that it stretches some very thin material to an almost unbearably slow run time. As so often with TV series, it's 90% filler, and the narrative thrust gets lost.

This would have worked much better as a movie.

Much of the scenes are unnecessary or drawn out in a way that could be shortened otherwise.

Sounds of Dahmer doing his horror stuff run over a black screen at one point. This could have been more efficiently handled by doing an L cut and having them run over scenes of seeming normality. Or scenes of his neighbor. There's a story to tell here about police incompetence and Dahmer using his homosexuality as a shield to prevent people from snooping around, or reinforce their stereotype of gay people being weird enough to not investigate the smell and disappearing people. The entire case is a textbook example of police incompetence.

The narrative structure is further damaged by the time jumps, which are completely unnecessary in a documentary style series. Tarantino can get away with nonlinear story telling. This material here cannot.

Aside from the runtime and narrative focus, the series' biggest detriment is its raison d'etre. Why was this made? Did we really need another series after several movies and series that exploits this tragedy for cheap thrills? Worst of all is the pretense of trying to ""give a face to the victims."" Yeah right. That's why the series is titled ""Dahmer"". It's exploitation of a tragedy, pure and simple.

Now granted, this can still be entertaining or interesting if done right. And a lot of it is interesting. Aside from the curious aspects of the actual case, the acting here is brilliant by everyone involved, especially the lead. He absolutely nails his portrayal of Dahmer with all the small vulnerabilities and the cunning and depravity.

If you have nothing better to do and are interested in the case, it's certainly worth watching for the acting alone.

If you're looking for horror thrills, you'll be disappointed, since most of the violence isn't shown.

If you enjoy faster paced storytelling or expect new information, you will be sorely disappointed. Maybe as with many series there will be a 2 hour fanedit version eventually that can fix the pacing issues. But even so.. you're not missing out on anything of substance by skipping this. It's a big investment of time into watching something that you'll forget about the very next day."
1.0,24 September 2022,After watching one and a half episodes even with fast forwarding parts. I failed to see why this show was ever even produced. His sociopathic had no bounds there was no specific method to his madness his spectrum of sociopathic-Ness was broad. Only he could ever explain why he did what he did. And even that wouldn't make sense to anyone. I felt that it was pointless to try to understand him even in this show! The only thing I got was power and everyone around him was a specimen. It was sick deranged demented and a unfounded subject to show the world. I feel films like this cause more damage. He gives people with similar thoughts and tendencies to think of him as a kinder spirit when they have none they are robotic and Deranged and sick. I almost threw up five times I see no point in the show. Other than trying to understand somebody that wasn't even humane and projecting this garbage into this world! Which helps no one.

I adore Evan Peters, I didn't in this. This was boring & extremely slow, no suspense, not much violence, so far ( I'm on episode 5) & that's surprising, it's not scary or eerie, I'm just pissed & done with it. It's like noone knows how to write decent shows anymore at all. You honestly could jump from episode 1 to 4 and not miss a thing! I'm pissed that I spent money and ordered Netflix to see this, ridiculous. I want my money back. I'm done with tv. Read a book. Get out of house.

The details are too much to handle. Then they try to focus more on the race factor even though the victims were not just black. The woke agenda has been forced into the story line which I think was unnecessary as people do read through the lines.

The story should have focused on one character. However, they try to tell many stories which makes this show all over the place. Very slow churn.

These two bros murdered their parents in cold blood. Planned, and executed, and confessed.

I would like to see this much concern over abuse to WOMEN!!!

Far too many that say: ""I don't believe her."" when clearly there's been abuse and rape and beatings. And, then blame the woman.

In series, he is shown as a creep. I mean, it takes just few minutes of first interview one can find on Google to see how to take that role. It seems like our main actor can only ""act"" one role forever. It spoiled the show completely for me.

My condolences to the victims and their families, I hope they found their peace. It's hard enough to be involved in tragedy of murder, but probably thousand times worse in such high profile cases that keep digging into the wounds forever.

Only show on Netflix that captures the essence of psychopathic serial killer is The Serpent."
1.0,24 September 2022,"Another 'true crime' that, rather than being centred around the bravery of the victims, has the sole agenda of showing these sicko losers, the Dahmer family, as 'anti heros'

If we suspend our disbelief to the level of this being just fiction, it's 'watchable', but the undercurrent of 'painting' the father as the 'good all round American dad' was far from subtle;

It is as if the father had to 'sign off' those Jeffrey & Dad scenes Glossy scenes, bad acting. Sorry we are not that stupid.

Dahmer, to turn into what he was, was clearly the victim of some SERIOUS abuse at home growing up.

This series stinks of 'film makers got rights from the Dahmer' family'.

There is ZERO character development about any of the victims ... think about that ...

The relentless need for the father to show the world he is 'a good guy' would make a more interesting film than this."

3.0,13 October 2024,"Ryan Murphy has been profiting off of real murder stories and twisting them around to sexualize/exaggerate the killers and romanticize the murders.

He never stays true to the real stories but likes to sprinkle bits of facts and fiction together. These were real people this happen to. Imagine having someone you know murdered and then the criminals and murders are glorified on TV. I have now seen two shows where the murder scene is shown over and over again to explain to the viewer the ""different possibilities"". You are murdering these people over and over for entertainment and money.

How have we allowed this to happen? Real life is not there for your entertainment so you can twist it into a new story which completely dismisses and dilutes the real issues.

If I had known beforehand that this was a Ryan Murphy series, I would have never watched it. I felt upset watching it because I know the real stories and he just tainted it. So anyone who watches this first without knowing/wanting to know the real story obviously has no sympathy for those who were in a tragic situation.

Please stop promoting this man. Go watch a documentary instead cause they actually gather more facts and show the evidence of court cases."
3.0,23 October 2022,"Not sure why it's getting high reviews.

The script is very simply about the main character, but the length is unnecessarily long. Lots of repetitive scenes, covers lots of trivial but doesn't help building the main character at all, which only makes the story messy and unfocused. E.g. They spend half of the episode on a victim's background / life, perhaps wanting the audience to feel empathy for him, but it's pointless for the story. (cutting out those parts doesn't make any difference, it's not like how the victim is / their life is, makes a difference in why or how Jeffery's decision to take their life. It becomes incredibly boring at some point.

The actor is the reason for the stars."
5.0,14 October 2022,"Flawless performances but very slow.

Whilst it's true that every single one of the performances are perfect and on point, and Even Peters again shows us what an excellent actor he is, I have to say that I found this difficult to watch.

Dahmer's victims don't seem to me to be portrayed in an exploitative manner, but I can't relate to the feelings of the families of Dahmer's victims. It must be extremely difficult for them to realise that the serial killer is remembered (and often inappropriately revered), when the victims are relegated to a backstory. Unfortunately this seems to have been the norm since the term ""serial killer"" was first coined. When will this change? Who can say?

I do think that his victims were portrayed in a very sympathetic way in this series and I really felt for them, especially knowing what their fate was, but I also feel that this production attempts to humanise the monster that Jeffrey Dahmer was and I find that very very hard to stomach."
3.0,28 September 2024,"I don't know how far I got into the series and the only part I watched was the Menendez brothers' story. I found that there was a lot of unnecessary nudity and sexual scenes that really didn't add anything to the program. If anything, it made me question whether I cared enough to see the show to the end. The murder scene was extremely violent, and again, who was indulging some twisted fantasy by showing the parents getting body parts blown off?

I heard that the real Erik Menendez issued a statement regarding the show. He and his brother are not happy with how they were portrayed. To me, there was a large emphasis placed on their sexuality and their orientation. Although their story is one of alleged sexual abuse, buy their own father, it didn't have to be filmed like a blue movie.

I don't recommend."
5.0,10 October 2022,
5.0,21 April 2023,"So Netflix went ahead and made a show about one of the most disgusting human beings who has ever lived, a serial killer that caused suffering to so many different human beings, they did not get the victim's family members consent to make the show, profited off of it, took it upon themselves to blatantly change true facts about the story, all just to make white people and black people hate each other??? It's the most insulting piece of cinema in the History of cinema, if you can even call it that. I cancelled my Netflix account about 4 episodes in directly because of this POS show, will never give them another dime. I advise anyone with a soul to do the same."
4.0,27 September 2022,"I apologize in advance to anyone that truly loved this series. I just could not, COULD NOT, get into it! I was already bored in episode one, and I kept going hoping maybe... just maybe it'd pick up. I've watched the entire show now and it never picked up. The acting is spot on! The actors and actresses here are definitely not to blame for this show being boring to me. It's just, a lot of scenes (heck, episodes for that matter) could've been cut down, or left out altogether. The entire show, in my opinion, could've been made into a two maybe three-hour special and it still would've gotten the message across about Dahmer."
3.0,21 September 2022,"It's not worth your time.

There are other films much better done, find the list on wiki.

Everyone knows the horrifying story so I won't go into that.

But this movie is just so horribly made. Shakycam makes a full on appearance.

The co stars and the starring actor can't act at all, period. For some reason the directors thought having the actors gaze off into the distance carries more weight - it doesn't. The story moves slower than molasses in winter, and just degrades the victims rather than telling the story of what went on.

Just go watch one of the older films that does a much better job from all angles."
4.0,2 October 2022,"In view that the word 'Monster' is part of the series's title, we know that Jeffrey Dahmer was one. But it was monstrous to subject viewers to dragging out the horror of the opening sequence that led to Dahmer's arrest. Details on the encounter could have, should have been brought out later and during brief flashbacks while Tracy Edwards was giving his statement to the detectives. The way that the first episode was filmed not only traumatizes the audience but re-victimizes Mr. Edwards and everyone who lost a loved to that monster. Including that poor tenant who called the cops repeatedly about the smell emitting from Dahmer's apartment but was ignored."
1.0,19 October 2022,
2.0,21 September 2022,"This is an excellently acted series, with a reliable script. However, the choice of the creators Ian Brennan/Ryan Murphy to bathe the entire series in a dark yellow palette is questionable. Even looking at the stills on IMDB, you get the picture of how dark and difficult to see this show is. I realize that the subject matter is dark and menacing but saturating the whole thing in urine-colored hues detracts from the formidable talents of the actors and crew.

Evan Peters is fine as Dahmer but the ever reliable Richard Jenkins really makes this series work. Recommended but only if you adjust the hues and brightness of your television."
5.0,30 September 2022,"I would say this is Murphy's attempt to be more like Mindhunter (desperate for some Fincher clout). However the lead actor just comes across as a boring incel and not at all creepy or frightening at all. I just wanted those scenes to be over through shear boredom. I was looking forward to this, but was more disappointed with each new episode. It really drags along and could have been told as a movie of about 1.5 hrs. All the flashback's kept taking me out of the movie, I know that is Murphy's style but it didn't work with this one. Murphy should stick to schlock horror like Ratched which was much more entertaining and more in line with his style."
4.0,27 September 2022,"I like the genre. I watch series of this type. So i was really looking forward to this one bcs it got generally great reviews. Already after first part i could not believe it has so high ratings. Actor is good - of course. But it is so extremely slow-paced and one part is in fact not showing a lot. The point of series could be good - to show people how the police behaved, or what was his parents like, or the perspective of victims etc... but this was so boring! It seems it took me ages to finish this series. In fact it was one week. Real disappointment for me. I recommend to read more details on internet for those who are interested in Dahmers life. Much better with more information."
5.0,20 September 2024,This is one of worst TV shows I have ever seen. The series went on to long. After Episode 1 it just gets Boring. They could have done this show in 3 Episode. What they did in 9. The reason for this bad review is that I thought the show went over the same thing ever episode and told the story very badly. The acting was not very good. The show was slow. Some episode were on 30 minutes long then the next was over an hour so to me they were trying to fill episode for the sack of making this series longer then it should have been. This review is a personal view. Please do not let this stop you from watching this show.
1.0,26 September 2024,"Netflix should be disgusted to have this on their streaming service. Lyle and Erick Menendez story portraits a relationship between them being so wrong and disgusting. Netflix always wants LGBTQ in every damn show and this one is not the one they should have added that to. Couldn't watch it after episode 2. Wrong on every level, not a real story. Writer only cared to add drama to it and make it unrealistic. The actors indeed did an amazing job i feel bad for them that they had to act out lies. If anyone actually followed the documentaries they know this is not written right. It's like the writer wanted to make fun of the abuse and rape and portray them as they enjoyed the abuse."
1.0,14 October 2022,"Given the subject matter, I have no idea how Netflix managed to make sure a boring TV show. Every episode drags and drags, with next to no story progression. Honestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews and outrage about this series. It was painful to watch, and not because it was shocking, or scandalous, or tried to make Dahmer a sympathetic character, but because it's simply bad.

I was hoping for a mixture of Dexter crossed with Mind Hunter and a little Silence of the Lambs, but for me this show is a huge DUD.

That's a shame considering what a monster Jeffrey Dahmer was. This show did little to expose his real story."
4.0,8 May 2024,"Egregiously boring with terrible information design. Why the heck this is 10 episodes I'll never know, especially when information is redundantly expressed so many times over.

While it is pertinent that he preyed upon the marginalized and the system in its efforts to aid the privileged continuously failed both him and the victims, it is also sandwiched into boring content. Not even the production seems interested in keeping viewer attention. It is so dull. Perhaps to match how otherwise boring the killer is. How anyone made it through ten episodes is beyond me. I made it about halfway. Bored to tears watching a show about a serial killer. Incredible."
4.0,7 October 2022,"This is the true story based show thats again lets me know again how evil crazy useless messed up creatures male beings are. Jeff's dad is a totally abusive cheating douchebag but it's very common as male beings. The cops who didn't listen to and looked down to the woman from the apartment and was totally useless but it's also common as male beings. Lastly Jeff, it's sold fact there're more girls and women who get traumatized and abused but those that turn psycho and serial killers are always males. People really should do research about them because there's definitely something wrong with the creatures. Plus people claim ''black lives matter'' and just focus on the victims but the truth is i've never seen a non black women attack black people it's always male beings too."
5.0,30 September 2022,"This is nothing more than gloating voyeurism. You learn very little about Dahmer's victims or even him. It feels like Murphy has written a 10 hour long episode of American horror story.

Nothing is nuanced. It boarders on the cruel. I felt grubby and nothing but distain for the creators. They've seemed to have forgotten or don't care that there are friends and family still alive of the victims . I hope beyond hope they never watch this ghoulish piece of trash.

I'm aware true crime documentaries and dramas are popular but Dahmer comes across as a one dimensional character from a badly made horror film!

The cast is great,would I recommend it? NO!"
3.0,28 September 2022,"While this mini-series is well produced and directed it doesn't quite hit the mark. A big part of it is Evan Peters portrayal. I really like him as a actor but he has too much humanity to play this role. The real Jeffrey Dahmer is vacant and robotic. He has no humanity, at all.

Richard Jenkins does his usual great job as a father who tries to reach and save his son. He is a semi-tragic character as he makes wrong decisions time after time in his efforts. It forces you to think any effort to reach Dahmer was probably doomed from the start.

There's no procedural drama here but the series makes it clear why that is. Many times Dahmer should've been caught but the police views on gays and minorities meant the cases weren't taken seriously.

The sixth episode is the hardest to watch but it also is the one that most clearly shows the impact of Dahmer's horrible crimes on the families. It also drives home that these people weren't just 'victims'. They were real human beings with hopes and dreams.

A series on Dahmer was always bound to have problems, so, for the most part this production is pretty strong. It's not an easy watch but is probably a must for true crime fans. The series does show clearly that Dahmer's actions were the worst imaginable manifestation of 'abandonment syndrome'. I would say it was above average but not great and maybe that's all a story about Jeffrey Dahmer should be."
3.0,16 May 2023,"I'm glad they at least attempted not to glorify the violence or create sympathy for Dahmer, but I don't feel this is a series we actually needed. Even though there wasn't graphic details, just saying what happened was unpleasant.

All the cast played their parts really well, even if some sections were overly dramatised or historically inaccurate.

The series also talks about people exploiting the families whilst doing just that themselves! I hate how, when you read up on stuff like this, they say things like ""we tried to contact people"" but they seem to take no response as approval to continue.

Subject aside, the first half was pretty strong but the second half felt lost."
4.0,6 November 2022,"Something happened along the way in this mimi series that saw it turn from facinating and inciteful to down right boring.

It all hapened in the later episodes when the sign language guy enters. That eipisode was the turning point for me. That episode was poory contructed adn the series never recovered after it.

The early episodes are really good. The unfoldingvof this mad mand is fascinating to watch.vvBut then Mr. Sin Language shows up and you want to go to sleep.

It's not the acting or the characters fault. It's the writing and directing -- especially the directing which takes a turn to the slow.

Disappointing."
2.0,5 October 2022,
5.0,22 September 2024,"When the 2nd season of Monster came out I got my bowl of popcorn and settled in for, what I thought was going to be, a series as riveting and compelling as the Dahmer story. The first 2 episodes lived up to what I was expecting, but sadly from there the series becomes boring and oh so repetitive. The recounting of how the boys were molested by their father is endless, with one episode focused solely on that. That episode I ended up skipping- it comprised of one over the shoulder shot focusing on Erik who was once again telling how his father molested him. That's it. The experimental film making was not effective. Just get on with the story. I was not impressed with season 2."
4.0,25 September 2022,"First, the acting, direction and script seemed sound. The problem is, Dahmer is pathetic in a way that makes for a boring story. I am a sucker for downer movies, and this is not out of revulsion for Dahmer, but this was a waste of time and resources. I don't think it's possible to make a good story about him unless you completely fictionalized his life story. One redeeming lesson: don't encourage your kids to play with road kill.

All in all, it would be a good thing if there were no longer a demand for serial killer miniseries, particularly where the effort is to try to stay close to real life events. By comparison, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer was a good movie because it took a pretty bleak storyline from a true story and worked with a serious, thoughtful script. If you simply tried to recreate what the real life character had done, it would be worthless."
5.0,3 October 2022,"Why are we glorifying a serial killer? Only in America so many people want to see killers and how they went about their ways, played out on screen. From the little that I did watched, due to Evan Peters, it was very boring and lackluster of a tv show. Ryan Murphy does have a lot of his tv shows with slow moving parts but this was just painful. Evan Peters tried to make Dahmer out to be some drunk, drugged up, lonely person, when in fact he was not like he portrayed him. I think Ryan Murphy made a show based on the fact that most of America loves serial killers and he knows their fascination, he ran with this one. Not many real facts from history, just his made up, twisted version to keep people watching. I'm disappointed! Slow and boring to boot! Glad I didn't watch and feed into the American glorification of serial killers."
2.0,2 February 2023,"It's such a shame that this series ends up glorifying a killer like Dahmer and shows the victims families as being unreasonable. I did not know of such a character before seeing this series, but the more I learn of him the more I feel that his end was justified. He deserved what he got.

As for the series, it did not do justice to the actual emotions that went with such a horrible crime spree. At the end it tried to glorify Dahmer as a changed man just because he accepted religion. His doing that was a way to escape from his prison life. He was only looking out for himself and never once felt sorry for what he did. Can't blame him cos he was an animal. But the series is also guilty of trying clean up his image. If you ask me, I think his dad was equally responsible for his sons actions and should also have been punished."
7.22,3 October 2022,
7.22,9 October 2022,"This is not a thriller series but more like a documentary drama. The attempt of presenting this disturbing story is such lame, almost comedy oriented way is very disappointing to watch. The unsuitable dramatization, luck of thrill and bad acting from boring Evan Peters all over the episodes make it unpleasant.

The story loses it's severity with the unnecessary gay explicit content, thanks to the writers's fantasies, has the Ryan Murphy stamp. Glenda Cleveland's story is explained way too much. Best acting comes unexpected from Richard Jenkins and Rodney Burford.

Overall it's not what the real fans of ID or Crime Investigation would like to watch but its more for the netflix public viewers."
7.22,21 September 2024,Really inappropriate to make it almost a satire with a humourous subplot. What is missing here is remembering two humans died - killed in the worst way be their offspring. These VICTIMS are entirely missing as people whose deaths we shouldn't tolerate. Instead we have a movie that will encourage others to reach for infant in this way. It is poorly rendered psychologically being little more than a late night movie. Ir is very badly acted. I am shocked it got past Netflix's ethics. There are some brilliant movies about serial killers - both in terms of being a good watch and for psychological realism. This is not one of them.
7.22,26 September 2022,"Watching it is an ok binge, I got to the end of ep.2 just there and I might not watch the rest of the series. I felt a bit disgusted at how realistic the reenactment is, like the level of detail freaks me out. If it wasn't actually based a true story, I think I could hack watching the whole thing.

PR on this series is a bit iffy too. Not sure if I can look at the main actor playing Dahmer the same again. Maybe he could be a good Joker one day. Anyways, I'm terrified for life now. I might have the balls to finish watching it in a week or two or maybe over Halloween.

Overall it's alright, bit graphic, story line will shock you, creative directing will probably shock you too, as they barely held back."
7.22,19 November 2022,
7.22,20 January 2023,"This is basically a big cash grab freak show with the real events either drastically tainted and twisted, or not on screen at all.

The most egregious of these falsehoods is Niecy Nash playing Glenda Cleveland (now deceased over a decade) standing in for Pamela Bass, Dahmer's real next-door neighbor, who actually got along *well* with Dahmer. Cleveland did try to save a real victim of Dahmer's but in reality, occupied less than a footnote in the true story. This is all very well-known and has been elucidated in at least 4 other movies, almost all of which are better than this crappy Ryan Murphy dupli-series.

Not all of it is abysmal. Richard Jenkins has Lionel Dahmer down to his facial tics and speech rhythms, and the other bigger name actors provide similarly strong support.

But how could any of them --- especially Niecy Nash! --- go along with this rancid fictionalization? There are a few odd events that make it in here due to the long long running time but very few are completely accurate.

Without more than a shred of truth, this becomes just a long morose Lifetime trash fire.

If you're really interested in the horror show of Dahmer, watch ""The Jeffrey Dahmer Files"" --- an experimental documentary with the REAL neighbor, Pamela Bass. Or Jeremy Renner's early portrayal in the indie movie Dahmer (before he became famous). Both knock the crap out of this pablum.

And Evan Peters really just sleepwalks through the title role here, providing no real insights. I think Netflix was terrified to portray Dahmer as anything but one-dimensional, so here we get Peters doing Martin Starr's Bill Haverchuck from Freaks and Geeks for ten episodes straight. No offense to the great Martin Starr of course.

Pass."
7.22,2 October 2022,"The first episode is entertaining and it is a good choice to start with the end of the story.

Then the nightmare begins, with a very slow storytelling, full of innecesary details, and almost justifying the conduct of the killer, without pointing in the victims that appear all along the story as second characters.

Some of the scenes are absurdly fantastic and unbelievable to the spectator like all the scenes of transition to a main scene from a repetitive scene where the killers buy alcohol over and over, drives his car over and over...

Advise: see the first episode and then watch another thing."
7.22,2 October 2022,"I've seen several movies/documentaries about Dahmer. This offered no new info, no new insight, no new POV. I had high hopes because Evan Peters! Nicey Nash! But this was uneven, and it assumes you already know all about Dahmer. What about the millennials who have no clue? I'm very disappointed that this basically was boring, apparently tried to muster sympathy for the criminal, glossed over his cannibalism and gave no explanation for it, still didn't answer how he was supporting himself alone in the house while in high school, and just wasn't entertaining or informative. How is my review too short?"
7.22,15 November 2022,"This would have been fine as a single episode. The very first episode could have been a neat little stand alone short film, but this is Netflix after all...

We go from ""Jeff's"" (very rarely Jeffrey, we're not so formal with our new pal Jeff) arrest, to Jeff's past, where guess what? He was picked on and excluded, felt uncomfortable about his desires (because of his dad of course). Man I really feel bad for poor Jeff. Just look how he cries after killing that 18 year old boy, poor poor Jeff.

That's the overwhelming theme of the series. It could be called Lionel Dahmer holds himself responsible for everything that Jeffrey Dahmer did, and we tend to agree.

That's the main point. Jeff was a victim of his parents and society at large. The people he murdered were victims of the police. Great work Netflix."
7.22,5 October 2022,
7.22,7 October 2022,"Disturbing and unwatchable. Makes Silence of the Lambs look like a stroll through Disneyland. It would have made a fascinating movie if it kept to the facts and didn't do deep dives into the mind of Dahmer for hours on end. I might have been able to get through it, but really it dragged. We know Dahmer was a monster. We know that he committed depraved and outright evil acts. Seeing it live on the screen doesn't make for entertainment. Heres my biggest rub about this series. It excuses his evil. It brings up details, moments and people in his life that appear to have led him through this path in life. Life is about the choices you make. Dahmer made bad choices at every step of the way. Sad to see.... No just horrible."

7.22,3 October 2022,"So the plot being ending first and then jumping all around in the middle makes it keep you on the edge of your seat but also confuse the crap out of you. That's my first problem with it. Second problem is I feel like the gayness is played up to an extreme in this movie. The parts where he tries to be intimate are just so foul and overzealous with homosexuality that they could have done without, or toned it down a bit. Also historically speaking, people weren't that gay back then, or at least acted less flamboyant. With all that aside, it's very interesting series that has more of a movie feel, which I really like about it, that keeps you entertained. No parts what so ever are drug out, action is spaced so perfectly your attention is always kept and not overwhelmed or lost."
7.22,5 November 2023,"This is at least a few levels below of everything... Rarely I cannot finish a movie/tv show but this was just a waste of time... I had to quite somewhere in a middle of the 3rd episode...

I though that would be a nice thing to watch right after Mindhunter to see the ""other perspective"" but it is dull...

If you like horrors and enjoy watching some random killer's homo sex fantasies and how he devolves/evolves you may like it... For me it was just a waste of time. Sure creepy, scary etc. But this will just leave a bad taste in your mouth and nothing much else to be honest. I wanted to watch his next kill, what it will be, his development but he was just an alcoholic homo mess that was doing weird stuff... Waste of time unless you enjoy studying such crap.

There are much better things to watch like real interviews with serial killers (Kuklinski) where you can see them and their real-life reactions or the lack of them/etc. This... just a cheap show that thrives on creepy stuff/kills and nothing else really...

If you expect quality and complexity of Mindhunter/True Detective this is not it... Feels like a cheap slasher/creepy horror with dull story telling/ Or maybe the story telling is decent but his life was just booze and stalking/inviting his victims to have sex fantasies and to kill them. Totally disappointing/

I am not giivng any rating because I haven't seen it all but two and a half episodes were enough to see it a waste of time/

7.22,6 March 2024,"This is overall a decent show. The best thing about it is without a doubt the acting. There's a stellar lineup of great actors in this and all of them deliver, including the lead but also the main supporting cast of characters. I'm pretty confident to say that this is probably the best thing Molly Ringwald has done in years.

The writing is decent, and the directing, but the tone feels a little odd to me. It's never funny but sometimes feels like it maybe is supposed to be. It's just so dark and sad and difficult to watch because of the subject matter, which they really do lean into here.

I know it's based on real and well known news events but I don't want to spoil anything about the story. It's a difficult watch and not a fantastic show, but decent. The acting is great and the show is worth watching for that alone, if you can stomach the gory premise."
7.22,16 October 2022,"Wow, this series is amazing. I don't think it's romanticized at all. It is a real nightmare. The actors are all veeeery good, and one of the most outstanding in my opinion, not counting the main actor of course, is his father.!

His role in the movie is very interesting.

I love the neighbour, my favorite!! What a woman! It's all just police negligence, no doubt. What are they good for if they don't listen to the alarm signals of the citizens?

The only criticism is the slowness that there is in many moments, although it also contributes to increasing the tension!! Pufffff

Don't watch the series if you don't like stories of psychopaths, and this one is very strong. Don't say we haven't warned you."
7.22,13 October 2024,"The Menendez Brothers is probably the worst series I've ever seen. An insult to the medium of ""television"" shows. At least the Dahmer series was somewhat interesting in its horrificness (if that's a word), and explored something of the human condition.

This series was boring, uninspired and could have been dealt with in two 45 minute episodes.

Like the Dahmer series, I would ask, who the heck was this even made for? Its a sad state of affairs that Netflix thinks this is good content. They think they can string together a couple of good scenes and somehow use child abuse to humanise cold blooded murderers. Minus 10 out of ten stars.

It was uninspired money grabbing trash. If you haven't seen it, don't waste your time.

I would rather watch an actual murder than watch that series again.

And the actors go on tour after the series talking about how the murderers are such good people and try so hard in prison and do such good things, after shooting their mum and dad many times with shotguns in the face and body and mutilating them. Oh, but they read poetry in prison and are completing university degrees. Such good upstanding young men.

They are just dumb, run-of-the-mill psychopaths who got caught. There is no redeeming quality in either of these men, and the fact that they still try to claim innocense is testament to that. At least Dahmer fessed up to it all. These men are scum and should rot in hell.

I'm all for rehabilitation, but at least the series got one thing right... The title, ""Monsters"".

If you haven't you actually should watch it. Its such a ridiculous way of exploring the whole bloody thing. I actually understand what the director was trying to do in a way, but it just falls flat... with me at least. Make up your own mind. B."

This show made me feel very disturbed and scared some how but it still amazed me of how good it was.

The acting was fenomenal by Evan Peters and deservse and award 100%. In my opinion this is not a 10 bc the story is very messed up. That they made an entire series of a pedofile, canabal and killer. All round it was an amazing experience to watch it but the story was insane. The scenery was amazing they made his apartment look suuuper alike to the real thing and Evan Peters as well did an amazing job of getting into the mind of jeffrey dahmer.

But, I'm totally disappointed that so many elements in this show has been twisted from the actual truth since I've read Robert Rand's book, the journalist who has covered this story from day one. Especially the characters of Lyle portrayed in this series is far from character and personality of the real person, in my opinion that's an offence and a defamation.

This is not based on the actual incident, lots of the elements are loosely based on facts, This is a scripted fictionalised dramatisation of the case. WATCH LAW AND ORDER TRUE CRIME TV SERIES, It's more accurate than this series."
