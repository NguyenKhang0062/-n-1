0,0,9.0,3 December 2022,"I have loved Tulsa King so far. I actually love everything Taylor Sheridan does so I knew this would be no different. This is fun crime show that knows exactly what it wants to be and you can tell the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a blast making this. It's about a New York mafia boss named Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi (Stallone) who is released from prison after 25 years. He thinks he coming out to a hero's welcome but gets sent to Tulsa to run things instead. After not feeling the love from his gang like he feels he should he starts to build his own in Tulsa. Some of it may come off as a little silly but overall it's a really good show that's definitely worth watching. It's obviously doing well because it's already been renewed for a second season which is great news!","November 13, 2022 (United States)",i have loved tulsa king so far i actually love everything taylor sheridan does so i knew this would be no different this is fun crime show that knows exactly what it wants to be and you can tell the cast led by sylvester stallone are all having a blast making this its about a new york mafia boss named dwight the general manfredi stallone who is released from prison after years he thinks he coming out to a heros welcome but gets sent to tulsa to run things instead after not feeling the love from his gang like he feels he should he starts to build his own in tulsa some of it may come off as a little silly but overall its a really good show thats definitely worth watching its obviously doing well because its already been renewed for a second season which is great news,POSITIVE
1,1,9.0,28 November 2022,"I figured this would be an entertaining show. We've grown accustomed to think that anything with Stallone in it nowadays would be a comedy, and Tulsa King does feature good amount of humor. But Taylor Sheridan isn't going to create a simple parody of a mob story and using Stallone as a joke and punchline.

The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big shot mobster forced to make a new start in a new city after a long prison sentence. Some comedy ensues as a New York mobster finds his way around Tulsa to establish his turf using his ""old world"" ways.

Characters are genuinely likable across the board. While it's not unusual to root for a ""bad"" guy as the protagonist, his directness and old world commonsense values appeal to those of us looking for something refreshing amidst today's social nonsense. Irony in the message is that it takes a thug who bows down to no one to smash through and expose the shallow social hypocrisy. This is the same formula that made Yellowstone such a success, and Sheridan knows this is what so many of us want.

Stallone gives an excellent performance. Before he became a caricature from his later roles that drove Rocky and Rambo franchises into the ground, his acting and screen presence created those iconic roles. It's good to see him back on screen in a role that seems perfect for him, and leverage some of that cheeky persona to add depth to his character and the show, rather than undermine it.

Overall, highly entertaining show that I look forward to, and an excellent addition to Paramount+ portfolio.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",i figured this would be an entertaining show weve grown accustomed to think that anything with stallone in it nowadays would be a comedy and tulsa king does feature good amount of humor but taylor sheridan isnt going to create a simple parody of a mob story and using stallone as a joke and punchline the show has promising depth despite the lighthearted premise of a former big shot mobster forced to make a new start in a new city after a long prison sentence some comedy ensues as a new york mobster finds his way around tulsa to establish his turf using his old world ways characters are genuinely likable across the board while its not unusual to root for a bad guy as the protagonist his directness and old world commonsense values appeal to those of us looking for something refreshing amidst todays social nonsense irony in the message is that it takes a thug who bows down to no one to smash through and expose the shallow social hypocrisy this is the same formula that made yellowstone such a success and sheridan knows this is what so many of us want stallone gives an excellent performance before he became a caricature from his later roles that drove rocky and rambo franchises into the ground his acting and screen presence created those iconic roles its good to see him back on screen in a role that seems perfect for him and leverage some of that cheeky persona to add depth to his character and the show rather than undermine it overall highly entertaining show that i look forward to and an excellent addition to paramount portfolio,POSITIVE
2,2,9.0,21 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone absolutely kills it in Tulsa King! For Stallone to do a tv show you knew it had to be a good script and of course it would be with Taylor Sheridan as the created. Sheridan continues to hit home run after home run. He is the best thing going on tv right now with incredible shows like Yellowstone, 1883, Mayor of Kingstown, etc. And movies like Sicario, Hell or High Water and Wind River. Everything he touches turns to gold. Also, one of the other writers is Terence Winter who wrote shows like The Sopranos & Boardwalk Empire. I mean come on? There was no way this show was going to be bad with those two at the helm. It has everything you want in a good show...drama, violence, comedy, etc. Stallone plays a very likable tough guy to perfection.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",sylvester stallone absolutely kills it in tulsa king for stallone to do a tv show you knew it had to be a good script and of course it would be with taylor sheridan as the created sheridan continues to hit home run after home run he is the best thing going on tv right now with incredible shows like yellowstone mayor of kingstown etc and movies like sicario hell or high water and wind river everything he touches turns to gold also one of the other writers is terence winter who wrote shows like the sopranos boardwalk empire i mean come on there was no way this show was going to be bad with those two at the helm it has everything you want in a good showdrama violence comedy etc stallone plays a very likable tough guy to perfection,POSITIVE
3,3,9.0,14 November 2022,"I watched this out of curiosity, no high expectations, I was just surprised to see Stallone in a tv series. You feel the tension in the scenes, it also feels fairly realistic as far as the plot would demand it. Wouldn't say it's humorous but a couple funny scenes as a result of Dwight (Stallone) coming out of 25yr prison sentence and not fully integrated into the way the world works now; so I'm assuming the abrupt transition will offer some interesting hiccups for him down the line for us. I'm glad someone told him how to use an Uber, it was funny while it lasted.

It's a pretty smart script but not in a forcefully witty way which bodes well. Of course Stallone is a huge presence but the rest of the cast seem pretty good.

The show literally feels like you took gangsters written for a movie from the early 90's and just threw them into 2022, makes for a good blend of humor and violence.

I thought it was just going to be a throwaway show as some of stallion's recent movies are; mostly just leaning on his name and performances but Taylor Sheridan does a good job here with writing worthy of Stallone's performances. I think it's gonna be fun to watch macho Stallone building a criminal empire from scratch, middle of nowhere Tulsa. I love how it has this western oater feel to it at times while still being mafia. I think the show could end up going under the radar, then get buzz later on with people asking how they never caught on to it earlier, because I haven't seen that much advertisement from Paramount.

I went in with no high expectations, but if the premier episode is anything to go by this could be a really fun watch. If it keeps on like this, great, if it gets better that'll be fantastic. I'll add a rating after more episodes release and update if anything changes drastically about the show.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",i watched this out of curiosity no high expectations i was just surprised to see stallone in a tv series you feel the tension in the scenes it also feels fairly realistic as far as the plot would demand it wouldnt say its humorous but a couple funny scenes as a result of dwight stallone coming out of yr prison sentence and not fully integrated into the way the world works now so im assuming the abrupt transition will offer some interesting hiccups for him down the line for us im glad someone told him how to use an uber it was funny while it lasted its a pretty smart script but not in a forcefully witty way which bodes well of course stallone is a huge presence but the rest of the cast seem pretty good the show literally feels like you took gangsters written for a movie from the early s and just threw them into makes for a good blend of humor and violence i thought it was just going to be a throwaway show as some of stallions recent movies are mostly just leaning on his name and performances but taylor sheridan does a good job here with writing worthy of stallones performances i think its gonna be fun to watch macho stallone building a criminal empire from scratch middle of nowhere tulsa i love how it has this western oater feel to it at times while still being mafia i think the show could end up going under the radar then get buzz later on with people asking how they never caught on to it earlier because i havent seen that much advertisement from paramount i went in with no high expectations but if the premier episode is anything to go by this could be a really fun watch if it keeps on like this great if it gets better thatll be fantastic ill add a rating after more episodes release and update if anything changes drastically about the show,POSITIVE
4,4,8.0,28 December 2022,"I've always liked Stallone, over the years, yes he's sequel addicted but has made some really enjoyable films scattering a few classics along the way. In Tulsa King could very well be his best work just from a acting perspective, he's just stone cold nailing the role of a mafia capo. The series itself has a interesting story, it's well written taking full advantage of the humor of a New York mobster in Tulsa Oklahoma without becoming silly at all, throw in a healthy dose of violence, good writing and dialogue, and a great cast of supporting actors and characters and they have a winner.

5,5,9.0,20 November 2022,"Sylvester Stallone 's Rocky, old school, hard a$$ acting style fits this show perfectly. From narrating to cruising through Tulsa it just shows that this role is perfect for him. Also acting as a guy his age and style definitely helps to blend in perfectly. As for the show, the buil up in first two episode was great and moving pretty quickly. It will be interesting with coming towards the end of the season how good and how big twist they have prepared.

6,6,9.0,26 November 2022,"I don't think any other actor could have played this role. Sly is bigger than the small screen and he's given the best lines in this show. I only saw the 1st ep on YT, I don't have Paramount, but if there's more being released on YT I would definitely see it.

His supporting cast is no-name, I didn't recognize any other actors. And filming in Tulsa gives the show ""flavor"" vs filming on a backlot in Hollywood. I think Stallone has reached his peak with the Creed movies and this TV show. Age does him well. Glad he's away from those action movies, which I think he outgrew.

7,7,6.0,13 November 2022,"Exactly what you're looking. Tulsa King delivers. Stallone hits the mark with a brooding no nonsense performance that blends humor and violence to near perfection.

The classic fish out of water scenario is well played. And the first episode does a great job at setting up what looks like a stellar cast. Right from the start the plot begins to weave together. Frankly I was pleasantly surprised.

We'll see how the season unfolds but so far it's a great change of pace from some other series debuts lately. There's no cgi to be sure.

8,8,8.0,23 November 2022,"The writing is good - Stallone's narration is well written. He's also good in this role. The show moves along and is entertaining. Problem is you have to believe that in today's world, someone would just show up to a town like Tulsa, start knocking people around and making demands and people would just fall in line and not call the police.

In reality, every incident in this show where he knocks someone around and gets what he wants wouldn't happen. Ever. The person would simply call the police, they'd come, see that he did in fact commit an assault, that's he's an ex con recently released from prison and he'd be in jail waiting a new trial.

But in this fantasy world from 1960 (that takes place today) he just makes demands and people does what he wants.

9,9,6.0,4 December 2022,"Likeable and relatively deep characters, plausible plot, tolerable pacing are the driving forces behind this show. Stallone is good being the main protagonist, but I like Andrea Savage and her character a lot, very nice performance. I respected a lot that Stallone is not trying to look younger when his character Dwight honestly mentions his age and how it could affect his relationships with younger woman.

Cinematography and music are nothing to write home about, both are good enough to help keep the show entertaining, but not really adding value and not standing out. My review make the show look pretty average, yet I'm rating it at 8/10 because it is a solid entertainer, not a TV/ Cinema masterpiece or tour de force.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",likeable and relatively deep characters plausible plot tolerable pacing are the driving forces behind this show stallone is good being the main protagonist but i like andrea savage and her character a lot very nice performance i respected a lot that stallone is not trying to look younger when his character dwight honestly mentions his age and how it could affect his relationships with younger woman cinematography and music are nothing to write home about both are good enough to help keep the show entertaining but not really adding value and not standing out my review make the show look pretty average yet im rating it at because it is a solid entertainer not a tv cinema masterpiece or tour de force,POSITIVE

The second season is hard to believe (even more so), full of family/girlfriend drama, and I just cannot help it bt laugh at their supposed toughness. I guess Sheridan was busy with other projects, lol.

Also, what is wrong with the wardrobe? They wear ridiculously silly suits and yet carry themselves like kings. Please, someone from Tulsa tell me this isn't how you dress over there:)

11,11,7.0,14 November 2022,"I really like this show . It's a bit unbelievable but mostly entertaining . The humour Stallone brings to the character ( of the writers ) evens out the bits that are absurd.

He makes the best of a situation he rather not be in .

12,12,1.0,23 May 2023,"The series is off to a great start! At least I had to grin a lot during the first episode, because I found the realization good. Sylvester Stallone as Kapo is excellent, the role fits him perfectly. You can say that the series is not the reinvention of the wheel, but you have from episode to episode desire to look further. Not many series manage to do that in this day and age. Apart from Stallone, the other actors are also well cast. The acting level varies a lot, but that's not too bad. It is not a documentary 😉. Only the end of the season was a bit disappointing for me, I expected a bigger bang. Nevertheless, I look forward to the future seasons 🤗. I can recommend the series with a clear conscience, even if it gets ""only"" 7/10⭐ from me.

13,13,9.0,4 May 2024,"I'm a big fan of mafia shows/movies and after watching Sopranos for the third or fourth time, I looked for something somewhat similar and was suggested Tulsa King by Google and many positive reviews.

Stallone is not believable as a mob boss and the general vibe of the show feels cheesy. The first episode also makes it clear that being ""inclusive"" was one of their main concerns when making the show, rather than being realistic. I found this to be a huge turn-off and after things got even more unrealistic in the second episode, I turned it off.

10 episodes where a mafia capo is exiled from his family after 25 years in prison and you will empathize every minute of it.

I liked the show, but maybe it's because I'm a big fan of Sly. It is possible to come across cliches from time to time, as if the story was formed when many movies and TV series came together.

However, it easily adapts the audience to the story with its fast pace, simple script and pretty good acting. While watching you will not see any nonsense that you would think ""what is this?""

16,16,9.0,26 November 2022,"So I have always been a fan of Sylvester. Yes, he has gotten older (as we all do) but we MUST stop comparing his Rocky and Rambo movies to his latest works. I will admit, I was guilty of this and as a result, I ended up thinking that his latest movie (the Samaritan) was not up to snuff and truly, the movie was probably a B at best. I am not sure that was entirely because of Stallone though. In any case, THIS new series (Tulsa King) is ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, worth the subscription price you may or may not have to pay. The part of Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi was 100% made for nobody but Stallone. He plays the part so smoothly and you actually believe that he really is part of the mafia....and with such humor that I find myself laughing many times throughout each episode. I actually have an alarm set on my phone to remind me that a new episode is about to drop (on Sundays) and I get excited (as I do with Yellowstone). I truly hope people will give this a chance and let this series be the series that Stallone can come back with and allow him to ride off into the sunset (hopefully years from now :) :)

But I've been pleasantly surprised here. I've watched the first two episodes now and they're well thought out and well carried out.

I like the modern angles that they've thrown in, like the weed farm. And I also like that they didn't make Stallone's character woke which seems to be the trend in television these days.

I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing how the season plays out!

The series, which is its main very good plus, is light. Though it has some good action going on in places, it is easy to watch. The main characters are well delineated and visually memorable (but not the names). A topical and modern comedy that can't be called very funny, but makes you chuckle.

At times there is strange acting and incomprehensible character motivation, especially one of the characters. The plot is uncomplicated and quite ordinary with its variations, which does not make it stand out among other similar shows besides Stallone.

Although the series on season 1 and has no particular flaws, but I personally have a feeling that the series will roll because of the lack of ideas and poor further implementation, but I hope I'll be wrong.

This is another installment from Taylor Sheridan showcasing rural America and sweeping horse ranches.

Although the large cast of characters is mostly likable, it is Stallone's ""it factor"" that evidently carries the show. Without him, this would just be comprised of a string of unfunny skits.

I don't care.

Fact is, from what I've watched so far, I'm entertained. I can find the meaning of life from sources other than Hollywood, though I take an occasional lesson from one show or movie. Those of us that work day-to-day experience enough of what matters to know what matters. It doesn't take some heavy opus to show me the way.

At least they made Stallone what he is--70 something as opposed to 40 something, and he's acting in his zone--not overly deep.

Many of the scenes are very hard to believe, but if you just go with it, Stallone is very entertaining. Yes, he is older now but still looks tough, and he's the type of bad guy you cheer for.

The few bad things that he does initially, he ends up taking care of them later. It's like they become his family, and he does whatever it takes to look after them.

He does end up causing trouble for his friends, but that's because he ends up bumping heads with other criminals.

48,48,10.0,23 September 2024,"I was an IMDB user before FB even existed / and I have never ever in my life left a review, but the Italian Stallion deserves one. This show is a mix of Ray Donovan - with a pinch of Breaking Bad, and a sniff of the sopranos. Stallone is in the fall of his career, but his acting is his prime. The cast is so well done, the majority start as chickens - but they slowly turn into eagles when they realise the opportunity given by them in their somewhat mediocre life in Tulsa. The cast is so strong, especially all new characters joining along the season. So many character actors (for those of you that don't know - the types of characters whose name you don't know but you know their face) - Domenick Lombardozzi (ray Donovan series) - Ritchie Coster - Neal McDonough (suits and ray donovan) - Frank Grillo (always underrated imho) - Barry Corbin - Alan Peterson - Max Casella - and many more. Season 1 was kinda 'get into it' - season 2 started so strong - love it, and Stallone is really a gem of an actor in the autumn/winter of his career.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",i was an imdb user before fb even existed and i have never ever in my life left a review but the italian stallion deserves one this show is a mix of ray donovan with a pinch of breaking bad and a sniff of the sopranos stallone is in the fall of his career but his acting is his prime the cast is so well done the majority start as chickens but they slowly turn into eagles when they realise the opportunity given by them in their somewhat mediocre life in tulsa the cast is so strong especially all new characters joining along the season so many character actors for those of you that dont know the types of characters whose name you dont know but you know their face domenick lombardozzi ray donovan series ritchie coster neal mcdonough suits and ray donovan frank grillo always underrated imho barry corbin alan peterson max casella and many more season was kinda get into it season started so strong love it and stallone is really a gem of an actor in the autumnwinter of his career,POSITIVE
49,49,7.0,15 November 2022,"This reviewer is indeed a Stallone fan, in spite of the fact that not one of his films made my IMDb list of the best films of all time (more below). Possibly that is because, with Sly, you do not expect perfection, merely a good time. With this ""vanity"" series, a good time can indeed be had, but not everyone is going to be pleased. On paper the Stallone/Sheridan combo is the odds-on favorite for an early knockout. In reality however the false bravado of the writing strikes a off note, as this oddball character lacks the sincerity of the Rocky/Creed films, and even lacks the chewy moral center of his most recent hit, Samaritan. (An under-rated film, BTW). So, bottom line, not for everyone. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

52,52,5.0,12 December 2022,"The show is just getting heated up by the fifth episode and shows a great deal of potential for becoming an even better production as the cast further grows into their roles. The role fits Stallone like a glove. Stallone's character at this point in the season has formidable enemies. Elements in his Mafia family have sought to undermine and destroy him since he has been in prison. A vicious biker gang opposes his activities. And the local Sheriff's Department is on the payroll of the outlaw MC. It will be interesting to see how Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi deals with the odds being stacked against him as he forms a crew and rakes in the cash. The show so far is well-written and well-acted. Let's hope they stay on course and don't run off the rails with unrealistic story lines.

It is generally a good show and for me personally what made me give this a 7 was mostly the writing and the finally was a bit of a let down. No real surprises and I think 9 episodes wasn't enough so it just seemed like they tried to cram too much into the last episode of the season.

The season has quick emotional swings in a number of Dwight's relationships that were all predictable and often rushed. The emotional development on a number of characters was too quick and dramatic as well. This goes both ways in either their loss of inner strength or going from someone that will faint from a sneeze to a stone cold killer. The changes are almost instant and would have been better if it was done over time versus rushed.

Stallone's acting is wooden and he maintains the same expression through every scene, though that could be he literally can't move his face at this point. He also delivers his lines almost mumbling. It seems a very strange choice of lead to cast for this.

As for all the early 10 star reviews...I'm going to guess that's industry intervention or there were a lot of people high on meth while watching it.

The supporting cast are engaging and well developed. The relationships between them and with Stallone's character give the show an overall feel that is reminiscent of SoA or the Sopranos. You find yourself rooting for him and his crew, even though they aren't good guys.

It was about time he stopped making action movies and did some great drama. Tulsa King has a perfect blend of comedy and drama to keep the viewer attentive.

Except for Stallone, there are not many actors with huge names which is nice. And choosing to shoot the show in Tulsa was a great choice. It makes the show more genuine and unique compared to other shows shot in the backyard of Hollywood.

It was really well written how a person being 25 years in prison would see the world when he comes out suddenly. The world has changed a lot in this last 25 years in terms of technological advancement and Mr Manfredi (Stallone)'s expression towards those changes were so real. Besides, this series will be considered as one of a kind with great dialouges. Seemed like the series and Stallone was made for each other.

63,63,10.0,9 December 2022,"This show is quite entertaining but it's definitely not because of any sort of realistic portrayal of mobster life. Everything is simplified and plays out according to stereotypes. The setting with Stallone being in the mafia plays to just about every stereotype of how the mafia gets portrayed in popular culture. The mafia stuff is a little bit like how it's shown in The Sopranos but it's even more reduced to basic stereotypes. And this show is all about glorification of violence. In real life, the behavior and way Stallone conducts himself would quickly lead to his arrest on a multitude of assault charges. But in this show, he's able to simply get through life and find success by throwing a few punches and enacting violence on those who oppose him. So if you view the show like a sort of comic book/superhero affair and put aside any expectations of reality, it can be quite entertaining. I would also say that although Stallone tries to weave in other philosophies such as 'The Art of War', he's basically just going to clobber his way through everything like the Incredible Hulk.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",this show is quite entertaining but its definitely not because of any sort of realistic portrayal of mobster life everything is simplified and plays out according to stereotypes the setting with stallone being in the mafia plays to just about every stereotype of how the mafia gets portrayed in popular culture the mafia stuff is a little bit like how its shown in the sopranos but its even more reduced to basic stereotypes and this show is all about glorification of violence in real life the behavior and way stallone conducts himself would quickly lead to his arrest on a multitude of assault charges but in this show hes able to simply get through life and find success by throwing a few punches and enacting violence on those who oppose him so if you view the show like a sort of comic booksuperhero affair and put aside any expectations of reality it can be quite entertaining i would also say that although stallone tries to weave in other philosophies such as the art of war hes basically just going to clobber his way through everything like the incredible hulk,POSITIVE

69,69,10.0,21 February 2023,"Tulsa King, the 2022 crime drama, is a decent show that entertains viewers with its well-executed crime drama elements. However, while it delivers a solid entertainment experience, it falls short of delivering anything particularly interesting or groundbreaking.

One of the show's strengths lies in its ability to weave an intricate and compelling storyline, keeping the viewers engaged throughout. The cast is also strong, with each actor bringing their A-game and adding depth to their respective characters.

However, the show suffers from a lack of direction in some of its scenes, which can feel unnecessarily prolonged and often pointless. This results in some episodes feeling like filler content, adding little to the overarching plot.

The show's best episode, ""Token Joe,"" is only an alright 8/10, highlighting the lack of extreme highs throughout the season. While the episode is entertaining, it fails to stand out from the rest of the season, which is a shame.

Overall, Tulsa King is a decent crime drama that provides an entertaining watch.

Now after his release a new start and a new life guess what in all places Tulsa, Oklahoma. This series is typical mob dialogue with profane talk and threats, all while the key character Dwight is trying to find himself and be a liked guy, it's like he's such a loveable anti- hero. Flashbacks and memories from ""The Big Apple"" haunt Dwight like his strained relationship with his grown daughter, still building a new empire and new extended family await in the Sooner state. The series is back and fourth with connections, with themes that involve trust, loyalty, and honesty.

No."" Thinking that maybe in that tough exterior there was a gentle soul coming out of prison to make wrongs righted, and after seeing 1 1/2 episodes, is it worth wasting 10 episodes watching this show? No.

Yet another show written by Taylor Sheridan for man-babies who need a power complex. Except he tries his hand at comedy, and it's almost as bad as Domenick Lombardozzi's wig. A man almost 80 sleeping with a woman half his age, pushing people around, punching people, getting everything he wants immediately after leaving prison. I.e. Boring. I can't complain about Rey from Star Wars knowing everything and doing everything perfectly and not do the same for this. He also gets a plucky black sidekick which made me wonder if Sheridan had ever met one before and a very bored looking Martin Starr is in it too. Wow, wacky weed humor, wake me up when Sheridan realizes what decade he's in.

82,82,9.0,13 November 2022,"I feel like the pilot episode is hitting all the right beats you would expect from Taylor Sheridan. There's the ol' timer, recognizable face, stoic most times, charismatic when needed. They establish the premise of the show from the get go, even starting with some obvious tension. And then, thrust the audience straight into Tulsa, just like Dwight (Stallone). He definitely hits the ground running. He starts recruiting his band of quirky misfits and sets agency in the new environment. And the episode ends with an interesting twist to the call to adventure. *chef's kiss*

Not all of it is positive feedback. I understand we're establishing a fish-out-of-water ex-convict trope, but it's a weird disconnect from time for our anti-hero--like it mentally froze for him. From the way he's being portrayed, I would imagine, he was in the hole for all 25 years. Not knowing anything like Google, iPhone or Uber apps, is very unusual for a society with so much information access.

No knowledge of the current criminal climate coming out of prison is also pretty hard to swallow. New inmates rotate in and out and they have all the time in the world to discuss criminality. That's why they refer to the whole judicial system as the University for Hard Knocks. Not to mention, I have friends in High Level Max's that have Instagram and Facebook accounts, with profile photos from their cell (both meanings).

The series does have its moments and some of the humor does land. But how people react to Dwight's anachronisms feels like sad pandering to folks who wish the good ol days hadn't evolved.

A well-done show with genuine heart and humor is rare, but to see it in a crime show? This show pulls it off exceptionally well. A crime show with heart and humor...what's not to love?

IMO this is Stallone's best acting since Rocky. He completely possesses his character and completely fills the screen. He's riveting; I can't keep my eyes off him. He plays sweet, he plays kind, he plays generous. And he also plays tough and cold and ruthless. But I had no problem reconciling these contradictions because his character is so well-developed and believable. I had no idea Sly had this kind of acting range. Emmy-worthy, for sure.

Obviously one can't compare it to his great iconic movies, but it's a better than average series, and Taylor Sheridan knows how to write for tv, whether you're a fan of Yellowstone or no, and I'm not really a big fan of it.

This series about Dwight, a guy who served many years in prison, took the fall for others so to speak, because he didn't want to 'rat' on the others in the gang/ mafioso.

He comes out of jail, and after meeting up with those from the said mafia, he is set up in Tulsa, and sets up his new empire, and knocks heads with the other criminal element, so to speak.

93,93,9.0,22 February 2023,"Packed to the gills with every kind of cliche you can think of and a few more more besides, Stallone's 'Tulsa King' is a nonsensical but likeable mess from start to finish.

Martin Starr as Bodhi is the standout performer, milking his Silicon Valley Gilfoyle character and transposing him to Oklahoman weed store owner. But Jay Will's cliche lathered performance as Taxi driver, Tyson also deserves a mention, as it rises well above the haphazard writing and often bizarre story arcs.

Some of the comedic moments raise a chuckle and the snappiness of the supporting cast and the sheer 'who cares if it makes sense' attitude of the writers almost works as a parody of late 80's action films and 'straight to DVD' Mafia b-movies. But I'm not sure that's really it's aim (or maybe it is).

Stallone is pretty wooden most of the time, but the old twinkle in his eye comes out every now and again. And Ritchie Coster hams it up admirably as the mad Irish biker gang leader, Caolan Waltrip.

The characters are not believable and the story simply does not captivate at all. And of course he has a young and good looking cop lady who falls for him. Nah, I don't think so.

The whole thing feels like they're trying too hard to make it seem like it is something it actually isn't.

97,97,9.0,21 October 2023,"Stallone's performance in this TV series is nothing short of unbelievable. His acting prowess shines through, and the supporting cast stands as a strong pillar, delivering their roles with finesse. The chemistry among the actors elevates the viewing experience.

Certain scenes in the series have a remarkable ability to tug at your heartstrings, especially for those who are fathers themselves. It's in these moments that Stallone's character reveals his vulnerabilities, and it resonates deeply.

While the action sequences may not reach the heights of big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, they still manage to entertain. The camera angles and fighting choreography might seem somewhat amateur, but it didn't bother me much, given the compelling storytelling and character development.

One character that particularly stood out to me was Mitch, the bartender. There was something about him that I found inexplicably endearing. Perhaps it's his laid-back yet quietly charismatic demeanor, or maybe it's the familiarity he exudes, reminding me of a friend. But the real surprise was discovering that he's played by Garret Hedlund, known for his role in 'Tron: Legacy' as Sam Flynn. This added a layer of connection and intrigue to his character.

If you're in search of a well-rounded series with a great ensemble cast that truly delivers on their roles, I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a watch. As I write this review, I can't help but anticipate season 2 with excitement, especially after learning that Sylvester Stallone has agreed to return to the series, which is fantastic news for fans like me.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",stallones performance in this tv series is nothing short of unbelievable his acting prowess shines through and the supporting cast stands as a strong pillar delivering their roles with finesse the chemistry among the actors elevates the viewing experience certain scenes in the series have a remarkable ability to tug at your heartstrings especially for those who are fathers themselves its in these moments that stallones character reveals his vulnerabilities and it resonates deeply while the action sequences may not reach the heights of bigbudget hollywood blockbusters they still manage to entertain the camera angles and fighting choreography might seem somewhat amateur but it didnt bother me much given the compelling storytelling and character development one character that particularly stood out to me was mitch the bartender there was something about him that i found inexplicably endearing perhaps its his laidback yet quietly charismatic demeanor or maybe its the familiarity he exudes reminding me of a friend but the real surprise was discovering that hes played by garret hedlund known for his role in tron legacy as sam flynn this added a layer of connection and intrigue to his character if youre in search of a wellrounded series with a great ensemble cast that truly delivers on their roles i wholeheartedly recommend giving it a watch as i write this review i cant help but anticipate season with excitement especially after learning that sylvester stallone has agreed to return to the series which is fantastic news for fans like me,POSITIVE
99,99,10.0,11 January 2023,"To start with the best, Stallone is absolutely amazing in this role - a mountain of a man who feels his age but is still worth ten others. Very dignified yet ironic and playful. He's almost the one single thing that makes these series worth watching.

Almost, but not quite - because his henchmen are also a vivid bunch - all of them are well played and everyone is peculiar and unique. Some have larger backstory, some almost none, but it feels like we get it where it's needed. And their interactions with Dwight are also well written and played - so at least some parts of the watching experience are delightful.

Some, but by far not all. Most annoying thing were villains - if New York mobsters were at least a little frightening in their quiet cruelness, the local motorcycle gang is a farce in everything: from the massively overplayed leader who looks and acts like a caricature with a violent tantrums the level of a spoiled child, to the rest of them performing at the level of wooden dolls.

Most, but not the only one - the plot itself - it starts OK but then just gets cornier and cornier, with ""family"" being an answer to all problems and healer to all wounds, and the variety of protagonist problems boiled down to ""feds, motorcycle gang, past crimes and angry daughter"" is, well, not original.

Stallone still saves it all though, so I'm planning watch season 2 when it arrives, no matter the plot.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",to start with the best stallone is absolutely amazing in this role a mountain of a man who feels his age but is still worth ten others very dignified yet ironic and playful hes almost the one single thing that makes these series worth watching almost but not quite because his henchmen are also a vivid bunch all of them are well played and everyone is peculiar and unique some have larger backstory some almost none but it feels like we get it where its needed and their interactions with dwight are also well written and played so at least some parts of the watching experience are delightful some but by far not all most annoying thing were villains if new york mobsters were at least a little frightening in their quiet cruelness the local motorcycle gang is a farce in everything from the massively overplayed leader who looks and acts like a caricature with a violent tantrums the level of a spoiled child to the rest of them performing at the level of wooden dolls most but not the only one the plot itself it starts ok but then just gets cornier and cornier with family being an answer to all problems and healer to all wounds and the variety of protagonist problems boiled down to feds motorcycle gang past crimes and angry daughter is well not original stallone still saves it all though so im planning watch season when it arrives no matter the plot,POSITIVE

103,103,9.0,22 May 2024,"After 25 years in prison, New York Mafia capo Dwight Manfredi has been released. He is expecting a reward from his bosses for not rolling over on them but instead finds that time didn't stand still while he was inside. His boss and friend, the man who he can rely on to look after him, is now only nominally in power. His son makes all the decisions and doesn't view Dwight as favourably as his father. He sends Dwight to Tulsa, Oklahoma, as he views it as an untapped market. Dwight has nothing: he is going to have to build a crew and the Mafia's presence in Tulsa from the ground up.

I initially wasn't interested in this series but once I noticed the writers behind it, many of whom were involved with The Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire, I gave it a go. Turns out it's not bad though is a bit disappointing in some respects considering the writers involved.

It started intriguingly enough. Dwight's backstory was engaging and the whole fish-out-of-water building-an-enterprise-from-scratch scenario was interesting. His initial steps into setting up a Tulsa operation are quite entertaining (though not entirely plausible).

Here lay the first problem: the plot is a bit thin, covered up with large degrees of style and swagger. This turns out to be a weakness throughout the series.

Allied to this style-over-substance method, we have Sylvester Stallone as Dwight. I was sceptical about his casting from the start: I know he's there for his star status but I kept thinking he's way too old for this. Turns out that's the look the producers are going for: he's literally playing his age! More tellingly, he seems like a cartoon gangster, far more flashy than credible.

This all said, it is reasonably entertaining. There's some good action scenes and the series moves along at a decent pace. Not a must-watch but not a waste of time either.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",after years in prison new york mafia capo dwight manfredi has been released he is expecting a reward from his bosses for not rolling over on them but instead finds that time didnt stand still while he was inside his boss and friend the man who he can rely on to look after him is now only nominally in power his son makes all the decisions and doesnt view dwight as favourably as his father he sends dwight to tulsa oklahoma as he views it as an untapped market dwight has nothing he is going to have to build a crew and the mafias presence in tulsa from the ground up i initially wasnt interested in this series but once i noticed the writers behind it many of whom were involved with the sopranos and boardwalk empire i gave it a go turns out its not bad though is a bit disappointing in some respects considering the writers involved it started intriguingly enough dwights backstory was engaging and the whole fishoutofwater buildinganenterprisefromscratch scenario was interesting his initial steps into setting up a tulsa operation are quite entertaining though not entirely plausible here lay the first problem the plot is a bit thin covered up with large degrees of style and swagger this turns out to be a weakness throughout the series allied to this styleoversubstance method we have sylvester stallone as dwight i was sceptical about his casting from the start i know hes there for his star status but i kept thinking hes way too old for this turns out thats the look the producers are going for hes literally playing his age more tellingly he seems like a cartoon gangster far more flashy than credible this all said it is reasonably entertaining theres some good action scenes and the series moves along at a decent pace not a mustwatch but not a waste of time either,NEGATIVE

113,113,8.0,4 December 2022,"I'll admit, when I first heard about the Tulsa King my immediate thought was that it would be a weak cousin of the Sopranos, or some woke take on the world of the mafia.

But was I wrong. This show slowly but gradually grows on you right from the first episode, and as it continues it only gets better.

This role fits Sylvester Stallone like a glove, and Sly is really showing that he should've been doing TV series earlier in his career, because he for sure is carrying this show all by himself. There are other characters for sure that also interesting, but none carries himself like Stallone does. And Stallone is bringing his A+ game on every episode, even going to the point of proving he can be very emotional and believable while doing it.

The shows knows when to be serious, funny, dark, and hopeful. Even when Sly addresses the current problem of wokeness, he does so logically explaining exactly how the current Gen Z has no idea what the previous generations had to go through. His character doesn't insult in any way those that are woke, he just asks the very reasonable question of when will enough be enough.

117,117,10.0,26 January 2023,"Absolutely wonderful series. It makes you pity the fact Stallone hasn't made more of these type of series - or maffia films, for that matter.

The storyline is great, the supporting cast is fantastic -Domenick Lombardozzi (!) and it seems to me that season one is just an appetizer for a even better season to come. The cliff hanger in de last episode definitely makes you want for more.

One point of criticism could be the age gap between Stallone and his romantic counterpart (Andrea Savage). In real life she's 49 yo and Stallone is 76 yo. But hey, she quite a sight for sore eyes, so I am not complaining.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",absolutely wonderful series it makes you pity the fact stallone hasnt made more of these type of series or maffia films for that matter the storyline is great the supporting cast is fantastic domenick lombardozzi and it seems to me that season one is just an appetizer for a even better season to come the cliff hanger in de last episode definitely makes you want for more one point of criticism could be the age gap between stallone and his romantic counterpart andrea savage in real life shes yo and stallone is yo but hey she quite a sight for sore eyes so i am not complaining,POSITIVE
119,119,10.0,24 February 2024,"It's a great pleasure to watch the ""Tulsa King"" take advantage of every opportunity to build and expand business opportunities with a twinkle in his eye and a macho grandeur, recruiting a bunch of quirky birds without getting flustered. Even if the story isn't the greatest reinvention, it is told with so much subtle humor, sensitivity, great acting and excellent dialogue.

Stallone hits the mark with a brooding, straightforward performance that combines humor and violence almost perfectly.

All the actors do a very good job, with Domenick Lombardozzi, who is also good for surprises, deserving special mention. But Dwight's new companions also know how to inspire. To list them all would go beyond the scope of this film, because they are all excellent in their roles, each in their own way. Even the smallest supporting roles are perfectly chosen.

The characters continue to develop over the course of the episodes. It's a joy to watch them.

The great actors, including their always to the point dialogues, as well as the humor that always makes you laugh or smile in so many situations, make the time fly by. You are carried along on a cloud that provides excellent entertainment. The emotional moments are not neglected. A father who doesn't agree with his son's choice, a father who would love to turn back time to spend it with his daughter, or the softer side behind a hard core. There are so many moments where the vulnerable side is also shown. This mixture is spiced up with a touch of tough macho gangster style and makes for excellent entertainment. The whole thing is then complemented by appropriate camera work and great sound.

The show has promising depth, despite the light-hearted premise of a former big-time gangster who is forced to make a fresh start in a new city after serving a long prison sentence. He has class and style, and nothing is allowed to get in his way.

------------- Conclusion:

Excellent - This is a very entertaining series that knows exactly what it wants to be, and you can tell that the cast, led by Sylvester Stallone, are all having a lot of fun doing it. All in all, I can recommend the Tulsa King to anyone looking for a great night out.

However, as he reverts to type and his gangster side starts coming to the fore I started to find him less likable even though you still root for him.

I can't put my finger on it but there's something off about his eyes. Is he wearing contacts? At times they were just downright creepy. Perhaps it's just me.

123,123,10.0,16 October 2024,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first season of Tulsa King. Sylvester Stallone finds the perfect balance of charm and brute force as a Mafia ex-con exiled from New York to Oklahoma. To his own surprise, he embraces the change of scenery and slowly builds his own ""family."" He also romances two women, forges a relationship with his estranged daughter, makes some shrewd investments, and fights a motorcycle gang leader. Season 2, however, falls flat from the first episode and hasn't recovered yet (I'm halfway through it). There are too many ""cute"" scenes, such as Sly's tough guy clashing with the head of a homeowners association or visiting a politically-correct private school with his grandkids. These scenes just feel like filler material. I also miss one of my favorite characters from the first season (who may have been written out of the series...hope I'm wrong). Finally, Dana Delaney and Neal McDonough are wasted in underwritten roles. She is too good an actress just to stand there and smile, basking in the charm of Sly's gangster.

Suspend you disbelief because the silliness is dialed to eleven pretty quickly and this gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your taste).

The show doesn't seem to take itself too serious however, so paired with the rather short runtime of each episode, it's pretty easy to stomach and get entertained if you accept everything for what it is.

126,126,6.0,13 April 2023,"I can't say that I recommend this show, at all. Taylor Sheridan the creator is--in case you haven't already noticed--a plagiarist. Sheridan's 1883 is a pathetic ripoff of ""Lonesome Dove."" And with Tulsa King, Sheridan plagiarized crime author Jack Bristow's ""Hard Time"" novel. The similarities between Bristows' novel and Tulsa King are striking.

""Tulsa King"" is the product of a writer who has never once had an original thought. I like Stallone, but in this show, the character Stallone plays isn't even remotely likeable. Additionally, this show borrows a bit from Steven Van Zandt's ""Lilyhammer."" But Sherdian doesn't understand what Bristow and Van Zandt and the writers of ""Lilyhammer"" understood: Make your character likeable. Van Zandt's Frankie the Fixer in Lilyhammer only bullied the bullies. Ditto Bristow's Tommy Roma in Lilyhammer.

In ""Tulsa King"" Stallone plays a thug we want to see arrested again, who bullies and extorts owners of a legal marijuana dispensary just because Sheridan wants to show what a bada*ss Stallone's character is.

Such juvenile storytelling doesn't belong on television.

It's a show that's unpretentious. It knows its role, sometimes it tries too hard (cheesy Stallone speeches), but then it comes back.

It's worth watching. The dynamic between Stallone and his new crew is amazing. It's something of a mafia/drama/comedy.

The location is interesting as Tulsa is about as far from New York City culturally as one can get. The humor is implicit similar to That in Young Sheldon, based on truths. A man who has been removed from society for 25 years comes to grips with modern society. Very much like Green Acres and the Beverly Hillbillies with a malevolent yet humorous twist.

It is an over the top comedy with Stallone playing the lovable tough guy, much like Rocky. As many have mentioned, it is unrealistic as Stallone would have been arrested about 12 times on his first day in town. Other things are implausible. For example, what nice hotel would rent to an out of towner with no ID and paying with a wad of cash?

It gets 8/10 because some of the NY scenes give the impression that justifies some of the reviewers' beliefs that it is a serious drama.

138,138,7.0,28 September 2024,"""Tulsa King"" is an outstanding series that highlights Sylvester Stallone in a role that feels like a perfect fit for him. The show follows Dwight ""The General"" Manfredi, a New York mobster who, after getting out of prison, tries to establish himself in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The mix of drama and humor keeps things engaging, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking.

More entertaining than I thought it was going to be and left me saddened when it was over after binge watching it.

I thought they cast the characters very well and seemed to work well together. Definitely made me like and dislike some characters as the show progressed at a very reasonable pace.

The show is a mixed bag of mafia scuffles, family drama, capitalizing on the local 420 market while rumbling with the SOA wannabees. The fish-out-of-water (25 years in the can) adds a humor element which helps remind to not take it seriously. Despite the writing power of the creators, this is not a high caliber series {like SOA, B-Empire, Sopranos}. The conflicts resolve withing a few episodes and so far there doesn't seem to be any long term story arcs besides the attention of the Feds.

You just sort of follow Dwight around as he does regular, mundane things and slowly get to know him and his team. There are very little mafia-ing going on.

150,150,7.0,20 May 2023,"Sylvester Stallone's career has always relied on his instinct for great scripts. That hasn't changed.

This series follows an aged New York mobster, recently released from prison, who discovers that the world has moved on and both his biological and criminal families have abandoned him. He is sent to Tulsa with the guise of establishing a new syndicate, but in reality, it's a place of exile where he is expected to quietly meet his end.

However, the old man refuses to let life slip away, finding ways to apply his criminal skills in a new city and era.

The script aims to capture the essence of Elmore Leonard's style, but falls short in some respects. It forges its own path, offering comedic relief that doesn't quite match Leonard's average humor. Nevertheless, this script invests more in its characters than Leonard typically does. The backdrop is well-crafted, and the major players are sufficiently developed to spark interest in their future journeys. Stallone's performance is exceptional, a blend of John Rambo and Vito Corleone, and the supporting cast is equally impressive.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",sylvester stallones career has always relied on his instinct for great scripts that hasnt changed this series follows an aged new york mobster recently released from prison who discovers that the world has moved on and both his biological and criminal families have abandoned him he is sent to tulsa with the guise of establishing a new syndicate but in reality its a place of exile where he is expected to quietly meet his end however the old man refuses to let life slip away finding ways to apply his criminal skills in a new city and era the script aims to capture the essence of elmore leonards style but falls short in some respects it forges its own path offering comedic relief that doesnt quite match leonards average humor nevertheless this script invests more in its characters than leonard typically does the backdrop is wellcrafted and the major players are sufficiently developed to spark interest in their future journeys stallones performance is exceptional a blend of john rambo and vito corleone and the supporting cast is equally impressive,POSITIVE

161,161,8.0,27 March 2023,"Stallone makes his debut on television with this off-beat series about a mobster realizing his mortality. The first 5 episodes are fantastic as it builds the world around Stallone's character, but the last 4 episodes start to peter out into just typical gunfights and fistfights.

Stallone plays Dwight Manfredi, a mobster who did 25 years for murder. Once he is released, his former mob family wants nothing to do with him, so the new boss, Chickie (Domenick Lombardozzi) banishes him to Tulsa where no mob family has a controlling interest. Once there, Dwight meets Tyson (Jay Will), an Uber driver who he hires to be his personal driver. He then muscles in on a medical marijuana dispensary run by Bodhi (Martin Starr) and forces him to take him on as a partner to launder money. Dwight also runs into a former mob informant, Armand (Max Casella) who thinks Dwight is there to kill him. Adding to his new ""family"", he befriends local bar owner Mitch (Garrett Hedlund), also an ex-con. Stallone's own daughter, Scarlett, appears as a barista and later horse trainer named Spencer.

The first 5 episodes are superb. We learn a lot about Dwight's past: his wife divorced him while he was in prison and he has not spoken to his daughter, Tina (Tatiana Zappardino) since going to prison. He gets romantically involved with Stacy (Andrea Savage) an ATF agent and Margaret (Dana Delaney) who owns a local horse farm. He also locks horns with a local bike gang led by Waltrip (a menacing Ritchie Coster), whose turf Dwight has invaded. There is also a local Native reservation on which Mitch's bar resides and whose inhabitant, Jimmy (Glen Gould) provides Bodhi's product. Jimmy has a sidekick named Bad Face (Jonathan Joss) who is a towering, scary Native. He doesn't speak much but is an impressive screen presence and actually has a cool sense of humor. He is used very little and disappears after like episode 6. That was a very curious decision by the creators.

The beauty of the first five episodes is how Dwight adjusts to not only freedom, but Tulsa. There are jokes about his age (Stallone is 75!!), his lack of awareness of new technology (he doesn't know what Uber or phone apps are) and his learning about life in the Southwest (a strange white horse trots around downtown and no one seems to mind). He's got tensions on all sides as his former mob family wants him disposed of (the older retired Don won't allow it), the bike gang wants him dead, and his daughter won't speak to him. Not to mention he is on the radar of the FBI and ATF.

All of this should have made for a modern day Sopranos. Instead, the last 4-5 episodes just become a series of fist fights and shootouts. The writing becomes weaker for the latter episode and the plot gets looser instead of tauter. While this is a fun, exciting series, I don't see it lasting very long because it doesn't appear to be interested in taking its time with the characters. For instance, his relationship with his daughter get resolved in like 2 episodes. They have not seen each other in 25 years, but it all gets glossed over. This should have been a 2-3 season arc for these two alone. There is not a lot of machinations or ""court intrigue"" for a movie with ""King"" in the title like in a classic Godfather or Sopranos world.

This show has much more in common with the Cinemax series, Banshee, than with the Sopranos. Every episode is a gun or fist fight and despite it supposedly being a small town, there is a lot of crime which no one seems to notice. While Banshee also included a ton of sex and nudity (Ivana Milicevic is a goddess), Tulsa King has a limited use of profanity for a show about mobsters and only one sex scene, with no nudity. Otherwise, they both start out really well creating the characters and then just have them either fighting or shooting each other. The final showdown is about as bland and unoriginal as you can get and has been done much better in just about every 90 minute movie on Netflix. I was really disappointed by the last two episodes.

The first 5 episodes deserve a 9 while the last 4 episodes are a 5. I gave this a 7 overall.

173,173,9.0,8 April 2023,"Enthralling TV series that explores the story of an ex-godfather's return to the underworld after his release from prison. The show's standout feature is undoubtedly the brilliant portrayal of the lead character by Sylvester Stallone, who gives a captivating and powerful performance. The character's transformation throughout the series is a testament to Stallone's skill as an actor, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is impeccable.

The series boasts an intriguing theme that keeps the viewers engaged throughout, and the musical score perfectly complements the scenes, adding to the overall ambiance. The series effectively portrays the underworld and the complex web of relationships that exist within it. It's a great showcase of the writer's talent for creating complex and engaging characters that keep the audience hooked.

While the series is a masterclass in storytelling, it does have one flaw that may leave some viewers disappointed: the ending. Without giving away any spoilers, the conclusion feels somewhat rushed and doesn't fully deliver on the promise of the earlier episodes.

Despite this, ""The Return of a King to the Underworld"" is still an outstanding series that will leave viewers wanting more. The performances, storyline, and direction are all superb, and it's definitely worth watching for anyone who loves a good crime drama. Overall, I would rate this series a 9 out of 10 for its excellent execution and entertainment value.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",enthralling tv series that explores the story of an exgodfathers return to the underworld after his release from prison the shows standout feature is undoubtedly the brilliant portrayal of the lead character by sylvester stallone who gives a captivating and powerful performance the characters transformation throughout the series is a testament to stallones skill as an actor and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is impeccable the series boasts an intriguing theme that keeps the viewers engaged throughout and the musical score perfectly complements the scenes adding to the overall ambiance the series effectively portrays the underworld and the complex web of relationships that exist within it its a great showcase of the writers talent for creating complex and engaging characters that keep the audience hooked while the series is a masterclass in storytelling it does have one flaw that may leave some viewers disappointed the ending without giving away any spoilers the conclusion feels somewhat rushed and doesnt fully deliver on the promise of the earlier episodes despite this the return of a king to the underworld is still an outstanding series that will leave viewers wanting more the performances storyline and direction are all superb and its definitely worth watching for anyone who loves a good crime drama overall i would rate this series a out of for its excellent execution and entertainment value,POSITIVE
174,174,5.0,14 January 2023,"What an ABSOLUTE amazing Series. Taylor Sheridan has hit another one out of the ballpark. With Yellowstone, 1883, 1923 and now TULSA KING, his writing has got us all hooked.

With having Sylvester Stallone as the STAR, We already wanted to watch it.

Sly plays Dwight Manfredi, a former FAMILY member in the Mob who was just released from prison after 25 years.

The ""Family"" wants him out of New York and sends him to TULSA of all places!

(A little reminiscent of the Series ""Lilyhammer"" Steven Van Zandt is a Mobster who needs to get out of NYC, ends up in Norway. )

Dwight finds his new ""crew"" after a couple of episodes trying to fit into Tulsa. A funny Culture Shock to be sure - adding in the 25 years in Prison he has missed a lot.

Each Episode is just as great as the previous one. Stallone has some great one liners that only he can do. He's got such personality in this series.

179,179,10.0,19 September 2024,"While I love the widescreen cinemascope ratio of this show and wish more shows would follow this format, the actual story is painfully lightweight.

It's another glossy crime boss story set in an alternate universe where unlikely events happen every day and cardboard cutout characters pop up around ever corner.

It's entertaining, deserving a 5 or 6. It's great seeing Stallone do a series. But why do they aim for the lowest common denominator of viewer intellect? Everything is predictable and formula-driven.

The playbook is easy. Maybe that's why they do it. A template-driven production guaranteed to ""meet expectations"".

Many shows have come before this in the same low-complexity, surface-deep rendering. ""Power"" comes to mind - six seasons of ""gangsta fantasy"", super-unrealistic cheese without grit.

Stallone is surrounded by cliche narrative on repeat. He's enjoying himself, and this series is one of the better cheesy series, but I expected something a bit more... demanding of more braincells.

His character, Dwight, is bright and has had nothing to do for 25 years except study. His quotes are reasonable.

I could write a long list pointing out holes in the plot, but the quality of this production is so bad it's not even worthy of nitpicking critiques. Everything that happens is so farfetched that it simply makes no sense. It's astonishing when you think about the fact that Stallone was originally a writer. The writing is bad. But what I noticed was that when it came to Stallone's lines the writing was noticeably worse, and not just a little, a LOT WORSE!! Which leads me to thinking this is a man who has completely lost touch with reality.

The concept is interesting and fun, of course there are some flaws and unnecessary things, but not much. The plot focuses on Dwight Manfredi, a mob capo who, after being released from prison, tries to start a ""business"" in Tulsa.

The characters are fun and the casting is good. There is a lot of fun in the show, mixed with drama and some dark events. Old feuds come to the surface as we follow Dwight as he uncovers some things from his past.

Sylvester Stallone does a great job in this role, especially when we follow the clash of generations where we see some things being hilarious.

After a few episodes it became clear that this series could be a great combination of drama, laughs and some disturbing stuff. The quality of this show is certainly in its characters, which are well written and layered.

What is important is that the writers try to entertain the viewer without burdening him too much with irrelevant things. Nothing is perfect, and neither is this series, but it's good enough.

197,197,8.0,13 January 2024,"SEASON ONE: 8.0 In my inaugural dive into the 2022 first season of Tulsa King, Taylor Sheridan once again demonstrates his mastery in delivering gripping narratives. Sheridan has carved a niche for himself in the film and TV realm, and he undeniably excels in it.

Sylvester Stallone, whose recent roles have often felt like echoes of his past characters, receives a refreshing change under Sheridan's direction. The seasoned actor steps into the shoes of Manfredi, a character that not only leverages Stallone's comedic abilities but also offers him his first meaty original role in years. Manfredi is a concoction of humour and badassery, making him a standout addition to Stallone's repertoire.

Sheridan's penchant for crafting morally ambiguous characters shines through once again, as Manfredi becomes a figure we can't help but root for despite his flaws. It's this nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the storyline and elevates the character dynamics.

Beyond Stallone, the rest of the cast contributes significantly to the show's appeal. Sheridan's storytelling prowess brings forth likeable characters, each adding their unique flavour to the narrative. Andrea Savage is a particular standout.

Tulsa King proves to be a highly entertaining show, seamlessly blending humour, action, and character complexity. As the season concludes, the anticipation for a second season is palpable. It will undoubtedly be intriguing to see where Sheridan takes us next in this engrossing world he has crafted. With Sheridan at the helm and Stallone in a standout role, Tulsa King establishes itself as a must-watch in the TV landscape.

It's a pleasure to watch TV that isn't preaching to the viewer or interjecting some living embodiment of hashtags to tick some award show diversity box.

Stallone never stuck me as the sort who could carry off a mobster role but he performs admirably. He absolutely dominates the screen, the other characters are satellites caught in his gravitational pull.

The ""boss"" biker baddie is the weak point of the story, he's just not Machiavellian or well written enough to convey the necessary menace. Other strong characters seem to pop up and then just disappear with no real follow through eg badface, the stable owners ex husband, the Brooklyn mob boss but this is perhaps set-up for season 2.

My mum has been singing it's praises for a while, and after watching both 'Arnold' and 'Sly' on Netflix the past weekend, I thought I'd finally give this show it's day in court.

I'm currently only two episodes in, but I must say, I'm already completely invested in this and really enjoying it. I find myself completely agreeing with the handful of other reviews I've read in here saying how perfect a role this is for Stallone. Thinking on it I'm actually quite taken aback that he's never played a Don or a Capo previously. Although I'd also say that is a blessing in disguise as 'elder statesman' Stallone is most definitely a better fit for this type of role than his younger self.

The cast and performances are great right across the board, although Dominik Lombardozi's wig is almost as distracting as Nic Cage's notoriously bad top-rug in Ghostrider.

There is, however, a disclaimer I'd like to add in regards to the amount of suspension of disbelief required here. I've never personally had an issue with this. I'm a fan of entertainment, and as long as a show hits that mark, then I can run with it. Whilst my all time favourite show is The Wire, I can also appreciate The Shield.

An old man assaulting multiple people would get reported to the cops with the result being a quick trip back to prison.

The dark comedy revolves around the strange situations that arise constantly.

You have to remember, Sly did some wonderful acting in the first version of Rambo and of Rocky. Each time, he went on to get worse and worse with each successive version, until he became a stereotype unto himself. So we know he has the ability, but where did it go?

Like all mobster movies we're supposed to care for the main gangster because he beats up bad guys as much as he picks on the little guy.

He was too righteous and preachy before, now with this, and his jail show mayor of whatever, is more cowboy, macho, idiocy. People portrayed in gangster movies should not be celebrated/glamorized.

The show is like a western-mob series - totally unique. And Stallone fits his role perfectly. Like he was made for this role.

I really loved the first episode (so much so I watched it twice). It started setting up the cast of characters quite nicely. The second episode continued the setup of further cast. I do like the actors they have selected as they seem to mesh well with Stallone himself.

227,227,10.0,2 January 2023,"In Tulsa King, Sylvester Stallone as Dwight Manfredi shows us how to win friends and influence people. Of course it's for the purpose of building up his own little criminal empire in Tulsa, OK, but still it's entertaining to watch as it unfolds. The creator and writer of this series Taylor Sheridan has an increasingly impressive list of credits to his name.

After doing 25 in prison, his organization exiles him from NYC to go take advantage of this opportunity that awaits him in unfamiliar territory. No one else is operating there (no one from NYC that is) so he has the whole place to himself. Or that is what we are led to believe initially. Of course there are others, such as the biker gang the Black Macadams, and he just has to find them and take over their business.

He has a knack for finding the right people to join him. And maybe a bit of luck. For example, in the first episode the cab driver who gives him a ride from the airport, becomes his driver. Pretty quickly he is going around and meeting people. Stallone plays Manfredi as such a gentleman, and has such a commanding presence, that even when he meets someone you might think would become an adversary, he ultimately convinces the guy to join up. This has happened several times in the first few episodes I've watched, and it really elevates the production.

Upon heading to Tulsa at his mob bosses behest after 25 years in jail, the laughable premise of Sly spontaneously walking into a local *legalised* and crime free weed store offering 'protection' for a cut of the vast profits makes zero sense. And so it begins, and so it goes... Further to the ridiculous screenplay the main problem here is the show doesn't know if it's a comedy, a serious gangster story or a redemption piece but hey ho - Stallone is in practically every scene, being Stallone, so who cares, right.

You can pretty much guess where this is all heading as Sly parodies himself and the mob in pursuit of building an Okie empire with the ATF hot on his tail and the cheesy one liners comin' at you like an angry Al Capone armed with a baseball bat.

A few plus points are some decent cinematography, editing and casting but the weak storyline, cartoonish characters and cringey script make this Stallone retirement vehicle all rather... expendable.

We just don't get as many shows like this and its a shame. The gang is a mix with each actor perfect in the parts they play, I look forward to season two already and the producers should be proud.

In this series, he surpasses himself and delivers an exciting and entertaining character. Coming out of nowhere, the series is a small masterpiece and entertaining from the start. I don't think any other actor could have played this role like that. The appearance of the now old Stallone alone is easy to convince. Sometimes there is not much more to it than a look or a smile from the old action hero. Just great and just the right mix of entertainment and emotional story.

Mild infractions soon become murderous revenge and empire building. Binge worthy TV with superb writing and a brilliant cast.

However, Stallone is delightful making scenes pop and supporting actors carry their water as well. Comedic one liners are well placed and dramatic, ironic moments do not feel out of place. It's reminiscent of old school content that has been modernized which reflects the gangster who has been imprisoned for 25 years being released into a changed society. We know we shouldn't root for a bad guy but he's so charming we can't help it.

270,270,10.0,27 December 2022,"After watching four episodes of ""Tulsa King,"" I can say it is thoroughly entertaining, mostly on the back of Stallone. To enjoy the show, however, one has to believe an aging mobster who was just released from prison can walk into Tulsa, OK and start taking the town over literally on day one. You have to buy the idea that a 75 year old, working basically alone, can terrorize people so much they start turning their money over to him. Oh, the same geriatric bad guy is also so good he's fully politically-correct (must have learned that in prison) and still manages to take the moral high ground at every turn. This man barely knows what a weed dispensary is one minute, then in no time he's telling the proprietors how to run the place and even using industry jargon like it's second-nature. And, we're to believe the fine people of Tulsa are so backwards it didn't occur to them to get a security camera or two for their business. They even have the stereotypical ""security guard"" buffoon literally eating from a bag of Cheetos while on duty. Stallone does a good job in a role that seems like it was written for him, and the overall production value of the show is good. But, if you are a thinking person in the least, you will have trouble with this one. It seems the only person in the cast with half a brain is the African-American driver Stallone hires to haul him around. That guy's family is so cool, his father, who is adamantly opposed to him getting involved in this organized crime world, goes out with Stallone's band of misfits one night to rough up some local opposing thugs.

288,288,8.0,8 July 2024,"I recently finished watching the series Tulsa King (2022) on Paramount+. The storyline follows Dwight, a man who went to prison for 25 years and is now out, looking forward to restarting his life. However, his ex-wife and children want nothing to do with him, and his old boss sends him to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to essentially stay out of his way. Once in Tulsa, Dwight links up with a ""legal"" weed shop and starts a new racket.

This series was created by Taylor Sheridan (Yellowstone) and stars Sylvester Stallone (Rocky), Andrea Savage (Step Brothers), Martin Starr (Knocked Up), Tatiana Zappardino (Superstition), and Jay Will (Rob Peace).

The show has a classic mob feel in terms of terminology, behavior, and mannerisms, which are then inserted into today's society. The premise works well as Stallone's portrayal of an aging New York mobster is spot-on. The dialogue is sharp, and the interactions and circumstances feel realistic. The attire, shootouts, and fights were a lot of fun. Anytime Stallone turned into a ""tough guy"" was entertaining, and his adjustments to modern society were also enjoyable to watch.

Sylvester Stallone is very good. I like his sense of humor in the show. Really enjoyed seeing him as an older actor. A lot different than the old Rocky movies. Dana Delaney was good too. The driver is good casting, plays well with Stallone.

293,293,5.0,21 January 2023,"The show was engaging from the start and I found myself binge-watching it, which is a rarity for me. The story was well-crafted with interesting conflict and exciting scenes featuring Stallone's character. It reminded me of the feeling I got while watching Breaking Bad, with each episode ending on a satisfying cliffhanger that left me wanting more without feeling overly dramatic.

The show had a few drawbacks, including an unnecessary and unskippable sex scene during a fight scene. The scene had no relevance to the story and the characters involved were not even established prior to the scene. The inclusion of this scene felt gratuitous and unnecessary. Another issue was the inclusion of current political themes, which felt out of place and added nothing to the story. While not as problematic as some other shows, it was still an annoyance.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",the show was engaging from the start and i found myself bingewatching it which is a rarity for me the story was wellcrafted with interesting conflict and exciting scenes featuring stallones character it reminded me of the feeling i got while watching breaking bad with each episode ending on a satisfying cliffhanger that left me wanting more without feeling overly dramatic the show had a few drawbacks including an unnecessary and unskippable sex scene during a fight scene the scene had no relevance to the story and the characters involved were not even established prior to the scene the inclusion of this scene felt gratuitous and unnecessary another issue was the inclusion of current political themes which felt out of place and added nothing to the story while not as problematic as some other shows it was still an annoyance,NEGATIVE

304,304,2.0,14 April 2023,"Simply put, I don't like Stallone as a gangster. Stallone is an okay actor, but he does not have the nuances of other actors who play Mafia guys like Pacino and Robert DeNiro. This Dwight Manfredi character is just a petty thug with no dimensions whatsoever. He gets old fast. I liked the character better when he was Tommy Roma from the book ""Hard Time,"" which this series rips off mightily heavily.

It also borrows liberally from ""Lilyhammer,"" but it takes from ""Hard Time"" the most.

Can hollywood come up with anything original these days?

There's not one vaguely redeeming thing about this show. The only interesting thing is the plot which has already been done before.

306,306,5.0,27 June 2024,"I was looking forward for the Stallone/Sheridan collaboration. But after three episodes it was clear that this is one of those series, which has an interesting premise but doesn't really know what to do with it. It is a mix of The Ozarks and Sopranos, leaning more towards the former with it's plot-driven approach. But could have been easily told with half the episodes. A lot of stuff feels meandering rather than engaging, precisely because nothing feels fresh here idea-wise. None of the mob guys are interesting. The police is mostly played off as clueless for plot convenience. A lot of characters are strangely gung-ho with entering or re-entering a world of crime. A world, that you can't get out of easily. Again, lots of it felt too convenient.

I finished the whole season, and a couple of sub-plots seem almost lifted from The Sopranos but without the subtlety. Which is a shame since Sheridan proved with Sicario, Hell or High Water and even Wind River that he's capable of creating nuanced characters. So this season was underwhelming, not bad, but not very interesting either.

The only reason it hasn't been is due to Stallones pulling power which people will see through after watching this.

316,316,1.0,25 May 2023,"""Tulsa"" was based off the Jack Bristow novel ""Hard Time,"" but the series does not do the novel justice.

Stallone's character in ""Tulsa"" is an unlikeable bully and brute. He's not even one of these anti-heroes that picks on the bullies. He's an equally opportunity scumbag not even worthy of a show. The character is petty and has zero depth whatsoever, unlike his progenitor Tommy Roma in the Bristow novel.

Tulsa King relies heavily on the fish out of water premise that was so prominent in ""Hard Time,"" but it does so ever so poorly and unconvincingly.

The boss in this series, Pete Ivernizzi, is a mixture Mr. Spirochete and the oxygen tank toting Salvatore DeLuna from Bristow's ""Hard Time.""

Hardly anything in this series is original. Again: It's a total theft of another author's work. I do like Stallone. However, Sheridan's propensity to steal other writers work--this isn't the first time he's done this--and his inability to write deep, engaging characters renders ""Tulsa King"" essentially unwatchable and unrecommendable.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",tulsa was based off the jack bristow novel hard time but the series does not do the novel justice stallones character in tulsa is an unlikeable bully and brute hes not even one of these antiheroes that picks on the bullies hes an equally opportunity scumbag not even worthy of a show the character is petty and has zero depth whatsoever unlike his progenitor tommy roma in the bristow novel tulsa king relies heavily on the fish out of water premise that was so prominent in hard time but it does so ever so poorly and unconvincingly the boss in this series pete ivernizzi is a mixture mr spirochete and the oxygen tank toting salvatore deluna from bristows hard time hardly anything in this series is original again its a total theft of another authors work i do like stallone however sheridans propensity to steal other writers workthis isnt the first time hes done thisand his inability to write deep engaging characters renders tulsa king essentially unwatchable and unrecommendable,NEGATIVE

Gangster comedies always suck, and this one is no exception. Stop or My Mom Will Shoot. Johnny Dangerously. Harlem Nights. All embarrassingly bad.

It's not remotely believable that Stallone could beat up men half his age two or three at a time. Tulsa has half a million people, some of them scary rednecks and bikers. Their grandparents burned down Black Wall Street.

333,333,4.0,4 September 2023,"Tulsa King is about 8% woke - enough to be periodically distracting and annoying, yet sufficiently low-key to allow the positive elements to shine through. Sylvester Stallone's performance generally rises above the caliber of the script, although he is limited by its lack of imagination and originality. The cast is self-consciously diverse, but many of the supporting actors give credible performances, including Jay Will, who brings some depth to a stereotypical role with the help of Michael Beach as his father, as well as Garret Hedlund, and Ritchie Coster.

The nine-part DTV series is a mishmash of familiar tropes, energized by Stallone's performance, but hampered by concessions to ""obligatory"" woke constraints. Dwight (Stallone) recruits a ragtag ensemble of diverse lowlifes who evoke memories of the Village People. The police are evil, corrupt, and incompetent. Dwight's love interests are frumpy, dumpy soccer moms. If even one young, attractive girl in a body-conscious outfit was onscreen for more than a single frame, she escaped notice.

Basically, it's a fish-out-of-water buddy film. The central characters who form Dwight's crew have good chemistry together and Stallone has tremendous presence. The various adversaries and villains are cardboard cut-outs with mannerisms in the place of characterization. The females are, almost without exception, horrendously miscast on an order of magnitude comparable to Sofia Coppola in The Godfather Part III. The script is serviceable, with enough positive elements to maintain interest, but also many elements that seem familiar and derivative. It's a bit like watching an updated version of a crowd favorite. There are no major surprises, but it is generally entertaining, although often disappointing due to plot holes and improbable devices.

342,342,5.0,5 February 2023,"And this is getting 8-10 ratings among a rash of praise ?

How much is hype and statistics manipulation and how much is genuine love for the series?

Is this really the fashion- Mumbley Mobsters ?

Well, there was Brando for that in the Godfather; 'Mind the Oranges Marlon!'

To these old eyes Tusla King (2022-) is typical adolescent junk, done with a bit of style, decent direction and with some decent-ish actors- many familiar HBO stablemates doing what they do with a rather mediocre story, and increasingly cliched scripts.

The series starts with Stallone in prison, where hes been educating himself reading notable writers. He rarely resorts to any of these during the 9 part first season though, probably because the writers of the meagre scripts have never read any of them ?

The writing is poor. Its ok for these types of light-hearted action dramas, but over time has become a stale cliche, the only thing surprising is the utter STUPIDITY of the events and decisions occurring on screen.

Everything about this 'violent attempt at comedy' is devoid of any REALITY. Gangs, gangsters,Don's Capos etc do not EVER act like these twerps on screen- its pure LA LA LAND HOLLYWIERD INVENTION for children...well, probsbly teenagers .

Which is in some way surprising because Hollywood has a lot of 'gangster/mob' connections & shared history.... maybe that's why they feel the need to fictionalise it to such a silly extreme?

Anyways , Stallone's character is in no way a hero, although that is how he is intended to be seen.

He's a smarmy bully and intimidates people under his influence.

He will resort to violence without though of consequence, while antagonising and escalating easily managed situations.

To any Christian-minded folk he would obviously be seen as a devil, corruptor and bringer of misfortune. The later two designations are impossible to deny.

For me , the most entertaining thing about this series was the utter chaos and destruction Stallone's bull-headed behaviour results in. All the while he's claiming to be helping and protecting those around him .He's a violent parasite in human form.

The misery and misfortune he brings upon almost everyone he knows during the 9 part first season is quite staggering... yet at the end of it they are all grateful !

This is similar to the mediocre PLANE (2013) film where everyone undergoes extreme trauma, and is thankful, as if they've just passed some sado-masochist initiation ritual.

This is even worse. Peaceful folk are induced by Stallone's actions and encouragement to beat people up with baseball bats, shoot a rival gang,, killing them, and selling Nitrous Oxide in Balloons at the local fair. The later isn't such a bad thing - yet their charge of $10 a hit is an utter rip-off....ahem.

Like most of these types of un-realist drama, no one in this has any friends. Its a hermetic bubble of narcissism and stupid brutality. This basic failing means that no realistic portrayal of 'gangs /gangsters' could EVER be realised in this series.

Without a NETWORK you cant work a net, or weave a web.

Did the writers/producers decide to make it more violent and stupid than originally intended ? There are many moments when it seems Stallone has an actual plan using stealth, and a lifetimes worth of tactile decision making,... then he just starts a club-bash or guns blazing battle.

Everything about the story is stupidly childish or so cliched it will induce instant Deja-vu.

Anyone with even the slightest knowledge of the 'mob', gangs, gangsters' and their ilk, knows about 'soldiers' etc etc... yet Terrence Winter is such a poor writer here that its all ignored for plot convolutions and dramatic turns instead. He did a better job with season 1 of Boardwalk Empire.

This series doesn't really warrant a proper critique. Its problems are endless. Yet, it is technically so well made that its easy to watch 30 minutes of this rubbish and just accept it for what it is- an excuse to keep decent actors & technicians employed, while allowing a showcase for an amiably psychopathic, mutilated, sadistic Stallone to have some fun, smirk , pout and puff his chest out....

343,343,5.0,24 November 2022,"The first two episodes are an advertisement for marijuana, showing that there is no problem for those who use it. It's a real disappointment that Stallone is in a show like this. Stallone's performance is a disappointment, the script is at least naive and the cast is one of the worst in this kind of series. Generally a bad show with the sole purpose of showing that if you pass drugs you're not going to get hurt, while statistically 75% of those who pass marijuana end up on hard drugs. I wouldn't recommend it to any stallone fan or anyone expecting to see a good cop show.

344,344,3.0,14 February 2023,"This is a straight-to-video VHS movie from the 80s repackaged as a new TV series.

I'm fine with nostalgia, and it was nice to see Dana Delaney, Anabella Sciorra and other familiar faces, even if those faces are now immobilized by botox and filler. It's really the shallowness of the script and the plot that make this show so bad. Lone wolf facing off against evil biker gang. Villains are stupid and easy to kill; our hero and his sidekicks shrug off flesh wounds. There is little wit and even fewer surprises. Try to picture how a caveman would handle a challenge and you can predict the next scene. More could have been done with the dilemma of an old time gangster, getting out of prison after 25 years and facing a new reality. Instead, everyone around him accepts his dated sensibilities and instantly joins his entourage, willingly allowing him to extort them and horn in on their businesses.

Also, the depiction of the black cab driver-turned chauffeur seemed quite racist and tone-deaf. When the driver subserviently calls Stallone, ""My gangsta,"" and does his bidding, he might as well be Steppenfetchit. I feel sorry for the actor who had to play the part.

Finally, when Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" started playing in an important scene, I really felt I was watching a rerun of a Miami Vice episode, though at least that show seemed cutting edge at the time.

345,345,5.0,23 January 2023,"Excellent premise, decent acting, but the writing is a dumpster-fire from another era. Stallone plays a 75 year old old-timer, and it seems the show was written by one, too.

You can count on one hand the number of scenes where a woman is talking about anything other than her insatiable need for d**k or booze. The lead female character is an alcoholic ATF agent who loses all professionalism at the prospect of jumping Stallone's 75-year old bones. Other female ATF agents are portrayed as having nothing better to do than scroll Tender at their desk. A rape is revealed in the most comically insensitive manner I have ever seen broadcast. It's like this show was written in the coarse of one afternoon by a bunch of highschool boys huffing Axe body spray in the locker room. After looking at the directors/writers credits, I can't imagine I'm too far off.

The show has one thing going for it though, and the reason I gave it two stars: the sheer effort required for Stallone to say intelligible words is both highly apparent and absolutely hilarious. If viewed as a comedy about a man with a speech impediment living in Harvey Weinstein's imagination, this show is just barely tolerable.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",excellent premise decent acting but the writing is a dumpsterfire from another era stallone plays a year old oldtimer and it seems the show was written by one too you can count on one hand the number of scenes where a woman is talking about anything other than her insatiable need for dk or booze the lead female character is an alcoholic atf agent who loses all professionalism at the prospect of jumping stallones year old bones other female atf agents are portrayed as having nothing better to do than scroll tender at their desk a rape is revealed in the most comically insensitive manner i have ever seen broadcast its like this show was written in the coarse of one afternoon by a bunch of highschool boys huffing axe body spray in the locker room after looking at the directorswriters credits i cant imagine im too far off the show has one thing going for it though and the reason i gave it two stars the sheer effort required for stallone to say intelligible words is both highly apparent and absolutely hilarious if viewed as a comedy about a man with a speech impediment living in harvey weinsteins imagination this show is just barely tolerable,NEGATIVE

348,348,7.17,15 October 2024,"I like this show, I really do, I think it has great bones and good potential. The cast is amazing, the plot and the delivery is fantastic but there's something that's killing this show outright, Stallone.

Now I want to be clear, it's not because he's a bad actor, because he's not, he's pretty good actually. It's for a completely different reason. He's entirely unbelievable in this. The combination of being 78 years old, and jacked up on steroids like he's an olympic cheater is just horrible. Because the problem is his movements are entirely animatronic. So it makes him seem like he's in a costume where he has no range of motion but pretends he does. And for the sake of the show. They keep up this charade and it's just sad.

I know he made this show, and I know it was his idea, and it was a great one, but the further along this show goes the more obvious it becomes that he was just a mistake as a cast member, she should have just been an executive producer and left it at that.

5/10 Stallone will singlehandedly kill this show, the best thing that can happen to it, is if he gets wacked and someone in his crew replaces him.","November 13, 2022 (United States)",i like this show i really do i think it has great bones and good potential the cast is amazing the plot and the delivery is fantastic but theres something thats killing this show outright stallone now i want to be clear its not because hes a bad actor because hes not hes pretty good actually its for a completely different reason hes entirely unbelievable in this the combination of being years old and jacked up on steroids like hes an olympic cheater is just horrible because the problem is his movements are entirely animatronic so it makes him seem like hes in a costume where he has no range of motion but pretends he does and for the sake of the show they keep up this charade and its just sad i know he made this show and i know it was his idea and it was a great one but the further along this show goes the more obvious it becomes that he was just a mistake as a cast member she should have just been an executive producer and left it at that stallone will singlehandedly kill this show the best thing that can happen to it is if he gets wacked and someone in his crew replaces him,NEGATIVE
