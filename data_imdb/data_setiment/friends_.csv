But then one day I happen to look up and see something funny and I got hooked. Out of all the characters on this show the one I can relate to the most was Chandler.

I started watching all the reruns with my wife all the time on TBS. But after my wife passed away in September of last year I just can't bring myself to watch the show. All I have to say is the show is definitely worth watching and it was sad to see it go.

Thank you Matthew for making me and my wife laugh.

After hearing the devastating news this morning that Matthew Perry had passed away, I'm watching it with a new pair of slightly sadder eyes.

'Friends' got me through a sad and difficult childhood. Sitting down to watch the new episodes at 9pm every Friday on channel 4, was one of the only things I can remember my family did together with no arguments.

First watched as a 12 year old, not getting most of the jokes, but laughing (mostly at Chandler!) all the way through each episode ....and now watching as a 40 year old, understanding far too well all the troubles of love and work, and life and friendship.

What a brilliant show.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i mustve have rewatched these series dozens of times since it first aired after hearing the devastating news this morning that matthew perry had passed away im watching it with a new pair of slightly sadder eyes friends got me through a sad and difficult childhood sitting down to watch the new episodes at pm every friday on channel was one of the only things i can remember my family did together with no arguments first watched as a year old not getting most of the jokes but laughing mostly at chandler all the way through each episode and now watching as a year old understanding far too well all the troubles of love and work and life and friendship what a brilliant show,POSITIVE

6,6,10.0,26 July 2005,"'Friends' is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today. It is truly a television masterpiece.

There are, however, many people who scoff at the mentioning of 'Friends'. My guess is they've never seen or paid attention to the show. It's easy to discard something because ""everyone likes it"" and be ""unique"", when in reality the uniqueness is actually bias. Just watch a few episodes with before making any judgements - chances are you'll fall in love with it too.

12,12,10.0,10 May 2006,"It is quite simple. Friends is a comedy of very basic humour aimed at teenagers and young adults, with unsophisticated sense of humour.

It is also painfully obvious that towards the end, they were desperately trying to make it last 10 seasons, most likely so they could say they beat Seinfeld's 9 season run. The trouble with this is, Seinfeld had 9 amazing seasons with great writing, Friends had (and I'm being very generous here) at most 5 or 6 OK seasons and then 4 abysmal seasons.

It became a soap opera with recycled humour and recycled character traits that weren't that good so start with, then got worse at the 100th time you saw them. I find it so hard to understand why people rate this so highly.

13,13,10.0,20 February 2005,"Everyone says that Seinfield is the greatest show ever. I love Seinfield but it doesn't come close to Friends. Every episode of Friends will make you laugh non-stop. We have grown to love the characters and what happens to them. The fitting personalities of these characters are absolute genius. Rachel the spoiled yet sweet girl, Monica the mother figure, Phoebe the hippy chick, Joey the dopey yet cool Italian, Chandler the sarcastic loser and Ross the neurotic victim stay together to help each other with their problems in the big city. I've got every season on DVD. This sitcom, in my opinion, is the greatest sitcom of all time and it changed the TV world forever. It's a great show.

22,22,10.0,7 May 2010,"To this day, the worldwide success of Friends is still a bit of a mystery to me.

Sure, the show has its moments, but nothing that groundbreaking or laughing-out-loud funny that would have justified all the accolades.

Friends was a very ambivalent show: it had the pretense of being believable, while still relying, and heavily so, on the same old Sticom 101 material.

The characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new, but in the end they all fell into a stereotype, as the show was devolving into a comedy-soap. Whatever development the characters had, it was either short-lived, flimsy or a ""Flanderization"" (ie. comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasn't so dominant earlier on).

The core of the show, the infamous Ross+Rachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous ""we were on a break!"" debacle. Both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat, which seriously harmed the empathy. Long, drawn-out relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down. Both Ross and Rachel instead acted like 8th graders all along, being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason.

It almost felt like them getting back together was the writers' Haily Mary pass... ""We're out of ideas... Let's get Ross and Rachel share a kiss, or have a baby!""

The ""happy ending"" feels more like a token send-off to tie some loose ends, but it's really just another knee-jerk reaction of two adults who clearly can't put their act together.

The same lack of development hits Joey as well. Despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot, if you're willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating, he goes from being a suave ladies' man to a childlike moron who's more or less his married friends baby. His aborted love story with Rachel could have been a much better finale, given he was indeed showing a softer side. But, alas, it had to be Ross+Rachel.

Monica and Chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred, so them finding each other made sense and, with all the exaggerated personality quirks (Monica is a control freak, Chandler is socially inept) they're the most believable characters in the end.

Phoebe can be fun on small doses, but she's clearly having mental issues, so shoehorning her into married life, albeit while still retaining her out-there personality, felt forced.

That's the most annoying side of the show: for all the hype and all the great reviews, Friends was just another sit-com, with plenty of forced drama. The innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature, but I maintain it wasn't that great.

Oh well, at least the show has aged horribly, so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller. Nostalgia will still keep it going strong, but to those who loved it so much back then I ask... watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",to this day the worldwide success of friends is still a bit of a mystery to me sure the show has its moments but nothing that groundbreaking or laughingoutloud funny that would have justified all the accolades friends was a very ambivalent show it had the pretense of being believable while still relying and heavily so on the same old sticom material the characters were supposed to be oh so modern and new but in the end they all fell into a stereotype as the show was devolving into a comedysoap whatever development the characters had it was either shortlived flimsy or a flanderization ie comical and unrealistic exaggeration of a specific trait that wasnt so dominant earlier on the core of the show the infamous rossrachel love story stopped being interesting after the equally infamous we were on a break debacle both changed their mind and heart at the drop of a hat which seriously harmed the empathy long drawnout relationships work only if at least one half of the couple is genuinely suffering about the breakup or about being turned down both ross and rachel instead acted like th graders all along being over each other and not over each other with no rhyme or reason it almost felt like them getting back together was the writers haily mary pass were out of ideas lets get ross and rachel share a kiss or have a baby the happy ending feels more like a token sendoff to tie some loose ends but its really just another kneejerk reaction of two adults who clearly cant put their act together the same lack of development hits joey as well despite him being the least objectionable human being of the lot if youre willing to gloss over his tactless approach to dating he goes from being a suave ladies man to a childlike moron whos more or less his married friends baby his aborted love story with rachel could have been a much better finale given he was indeed showing a softer side but alas it had to be rossrachel monica and chandler shared a tragicomically traumatic childhood that left them scarred so them finding each other made sense and with all the exaggerated personality quirks monica is a control freak chandler is socially inept theyre the most believable characters in the end phoebe can be fun on small doses but shes clearly having mental issues so shoehorning her into married life albeit while still retaining her outthere personality felt forced thats the most annoying side of the show for all the hype and all the great reviews friends was just another sitcom with plenty of forced drama the innovative love story between a cute girl and a dork is still sold as a top feature but i maintain it wasnt that great oh well at least the show has aged horribly so the chances of it still being perceived as one of the best of all time are getting smaller nostalgia will still keep it going strong but to those who loved it so much back then i ask watch it again and see if it was worth all the praise,NEGATIVE

26,26,10.0,15 September 2020,"Binging it. Still not getting enough of this masterpiece of a show. Let me be clear, i do consider Seinfeld as the greatest sitcom spectacle ever made but FRIENDS is right there too. Among the Best if not the Best.

Matt LeBlanc is the reason why you have gotta watch this show. I've binged countless number of times, just assume it's more than 100 times. Only character I've found hard to hate is Joey. Chandler as well is i can't hate but Joey is flawless. Now i rank all my 6 favorite Friends in order & a bit of description:

Joey: The reason for me Binge watching it.

Chandler: He cracks me up effortlessly just like George Costanza does.

Ross: Subtle but he's surprisingly humorous.

Rachel: Babe of the show.

Monica: She's irritating at times, but finds a way to get by. Her chemistry with every other character saves her in the show.

Phoebe: Friends will still be a blockbuster if she wouldn't have been in it. Seriously!? The most unfunny & my least favorite character not only of this show but of all-time. Bossy, supercilious, tries to use sarcasm desperately yet flops miserably. She's blah. Her angle is so selfish as well. I just despise her. Really a buzz kill is what you'll say.

Beauty of me binging Friends is that I've cropped out Phoebe's parts specifically from all 235 episodes of 10 seasons. And it's so much better that way for me.

Joey & Chandler's aka J-Man and Channys bonding is the lifeblood and actually plot of the show. Really, they both are the reason why FRIENDS has become such a cult.

I really need makers/writers to find a way to bring all of them back on the screen sooner than later.

27,27,10.0,23 September 2015,"I am quoting some body but I totally agree with this - ""If I get a wish from a genie someday, I would ask him to erase my memory, so that I can watch Friends again afresh and relish those priceless moments....""

To say that F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a good situation comedy would be a gross understatement of monumental proportions. When you watch friends, you just don't watch it, you live it.

It is not about how perfect you have to make your life.. it is about how every moment , good or bad , together makes life perfect.

No matter what kind of person you are, you can always relate to its story line. Unlike most of the contemporary serials, this one does not have a narrow perspective. There are no fart jokes, no clichés, no stereotypical bullshit - just original day-to-day incidents and the fun and laughter and quarrels associated with it. There are no jokes for joking sake. And it would blow your mind to think how anyone can create six characters like Chandler Bing, Monica Geller, Joey Tribbiani, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green and Ross Geller.

I didn't discover Friends until a year or two ago (thanks to MY friends) but I ADORE the show in syndication and I hope to own the DVDs. Its damn funny and no one can deny it. Except for stiffs. And whats best about Friends is that its REAL.

Ross and Rachel getting old? How could it? Do relationships get old in real life? No, they're ongoing, sometimes stagnating, sometimes changing. Thats REAL.

This show is about 6 people who love each other like family...which I must say as an 18 year old... is very real. Once you hit your late teens - early twenties...things begin to change. You grow both closer to and further from your biological family, and as you reach more independence, you adopt another family of your own: YOUR FRIENDS.

Although the atmosphere of the series usually takes place between a cafe and an apartment, the series itself is so great that this point is not important at all.

Each part can be seen separately and all the parts can be linked together.

It is impossible to say which character was better because all six characters were complementary.

The comedy of the situation of the series and the laughs also helped to make the series funnier.

Unpleasant events, discomforts, and problems were also seen in the series, and sometimes there was a balance between laughter and crying, and it was very touching.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",in my view two reasons were effective in making this series popular and loved firstly the script and dialogues which were written with great detail and secondly the unique acting of the six main characters who played very well although the atmosphere of the series usually takes place between a cafe and an apartment the series itself is so great that this point is not important at all each part can be seen separately and all the parts can be linked together it is impossible to say which character was better because all six characters were complementary the comedy of the situation of the series and the laughs also helped to make the series funnier unpleasant events discomforts and problems were also seen in the series and sometimes there was a balance between laughter and crying and it was very touching,POSITIVE
52,52,10.0,24 May 2010,"I have nothing against sit-coms in general, as long as they are funny. In America, there is Frasier and Will & Grace, in Britain, there is Only Fools and Horses and Last of the Summer Wine, they are great sit-coms. There was a time when I didn't like Friends very much, then again it was also at a time when I wasn't into sit-coms. My brother and sister, who absolutely adore the show suggested I should try the show again, so I did. Well, my initial reaction of the show was wrong, this show is great, it is funny and smart with appealing characters. It is by far one of the better American sit-coms and I do think it is better than Everybody Loves Raymond.

First and foremost, I love the theme song. It may get on some people's nerves, but I find it irresistibly catchy, memorable and fun, with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant.

I also love how funny and smart Friends is. Some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever. That reminds me when I see and review When Harry Met Sally, maybe the title of the review should be ""The One With the Scene in the Diner"". Along with this the writing is consistently funny, with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy. I even like the plot lines, I don't find them boring, predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile.

The direction is also really solid, and the photography and scenery are striking.

I love the characters, they are unique and engaging, even with their flaws they manage to be likable. Rachel does have moments when she is spoilt, but she is also the epitome of sweetness. I know there are people who have problems with Jennifer Aniston, the thing is I don't and I find her at her prettiest and most appealing here. Monica is another strong character, not the funniest by all means, but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude. I loved how Courtney Cox portrayed her. Phoebe is my favourite female character, she is hilarious; I especially love her songs, they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great. Lisa Kudrow couldn't have been the more perfect choice for her, she pulls off Phoebe's personality to perfection.

Joey is stupid admittedly, but I love him anyway because he is also cool. I am not a huge fan of Matt LeBlanc, but he is really good as Joey. Matthew Perry is great as Chandler, who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character, who makes jokes that are almost as bad as Phoebe's songs, but he is still a likable character in his own right. Ross is deliciously neurotic, I constantly love his priceless facial expressions and David Schwimmer's delivery is absolutely perfect.

There have also been some wonderful guest stars, Elliot Gould as Jack Geller, Gary Oldman(who I really like in films like Dracula and Immortal Beloved) as Richard Crosby, Michael McKean and Danny DeVito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policeman's outfit, all but to name a few. Overall, I love this show, not only for the writing but for the characters. 10/10 Bethany Cox","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have nothing against sitcoms in general as long as they are funny in america there is frasier and will grace in britain there is only fools and horses and last of the summer wine they are great sitcoms there was a time when i didnt like friends very much then again it was also at a time when i wasnt into sitcoms my brother and sister who absolutely adore the show suggested i should try the show again so i did well my initial reaction of the show was wrong this show is great it is funny and smart with appealing characters it is by far one of the better american sitcoms and i do think it is better than everybody loves raymond first and foremost i love the theme song it may get on some peoples nerves but i find it irresistibly catchy memorable and fun with a simple melody and nice lyrics that are relevant i also love how funny and smart friends is some of the episode titles alone are hilarious and clever that reminds me when i see and review when harry met sally maybe the title of the review should be the one with the scene in the diner along with this the writing is consistently funny with some wit and intelligence and very rarely becomes clichéd and cringe worthy i even like the plot lines i dont find them boring predictable perhaps occasionally but the funny situations that the characters get into make them absorbing and worthwhile the direction is also really solid and the photography and scenery are striking i love the characters they are unique and engaging even with their flaws they manage to be likable rachel does have moments when she is spoilt but she is also the epitome of sweetness i know there are people who have problems with jennifer aniston the thing is i dont and i find her at her prettiest and most appealing here monica is another strong character not the funniest by all means but because she is almost like a maternal figure to the other characters with her caring and sympathetic attitude i loved how courtney cox portrayed her phoebe is my favourite female character she is hilarious i especially love her songs they are the sort of songs that are so bad they are great lisa kudrow couldnt have been the more perfect choice for her she pulls off phoebes personality to perfection joey is stupid admittedly but i love him anyway because he is also cool i am not a huge fan of matt leblanc but he is really good as joey matthew perry is great as chandler who is like a clownish and sarcastic sort of character who makes jokes that are almost as bad as phoebes songs but he is still a likable character in his own right ross is deliciously neurotic i constantly love his priceless facial expressions and david schwimmers delivery is absolutely perfect there have also been some wonderful guest stars elliot gould as jack geller gary oldmanwho i really like in films like dracula and immortal beloved as richard crosby michael mckean and danny devito as a stripper who arrives at a party in a policemans outfit all but to name a few overall i love this show not only for the writing but for the characters bethany cox,POSITIVE

I like Chandler very much,especially his ""hi5"".Joey's ""How u doing?"",Phoebe's ""Smelly Cat"".Monica's food,Ross's paleontology classes and Rachel.......I miss all of it and I miss this show a lot.And also the comedy in this goes great season to season.It'll be good if they make a film on it.And that's why its the greatest show ever!!!

Friends'is simply the best series ever aired. The acting is amazing; after watching a few episodes you stop referring to the actors by their real names altogether, even if they appear in another movie. The characters are addictive, none are completely positive or negative. It would be quite easy to get along with or to be very annoyed by any of them in real life. Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today.

56,56,10.0,1 December 2008,"To these days I can't figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people. The best conclusion I could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that American people where suffering in those days.

Perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as: divorce, infidelity, sexual inclinations, obsession etc, with a smile on their faces, real people in a way, could deal with that issues in that way. However, ""Friends"" was a fictional show, much of what it happened, albeit taken from reality, was dealt in a light-hearted way.

To sum up, although the premise was interesting (six friends living together in New York), the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",to these days i cant figure out what made this average sitcom to be so especial for people the best conclusion i could reach is that this show served for escapism to the real issues that american people where suffering in those days perhaps by seeing that those characters could overcome topics such as divorce infidelity sexual inclinations obsession etc with a smile on their faces real people in a way could deal with that issues in that way however friends was a fictional show much of what it happened albeit taken from reality was dealt in a lighthearted way to sum up although the premise was interesting six friends living together in new york the development of the plot and characters could have been a bit more realistic,POSITIVE

60,60,7.0,20 April 2020,"Which character do you like best in the six-person line? I remember arguing with a classmate before. Because the character I like, but she didn't like it, she attacked each other. Now, I think this question is inherently superfluous, and the argument is even more. Six people, just six characters with different personalities, different infectivity and characteristics, who you like, just like radish and cabbage, each has its own reason. In particular, after I revisited the six-person line for the second time, I found that my favorite character is no longer the same as it was over a year ago, and I felt that the debate was a bit redundant.

Many friends around have seen the six-person walk. In my sophomore 's dormitory, students who had just bought a computer were broadcasting six people in a row. At that time, I went out to work in the school newspaper every day. Every time I heard everyone laughed about a computer and got a stomachache. The voice of the laughter was just noisy, and I just glanced at it, and I saw that the characters inside were not too eye-catching pretty girls and handsome guys (I did n't think she was pretty when I stared at Jennifer Aniston 's posters), and thought the lines were a bit boring . During college, I never spent my time on TV series. This ""bad habit"" started after work. After work, I go home after work. I do n't like nightlife or socializing. After work, of course, I do n't want to work anymore, so I can watch some comedy and pass the time before I think of six people. I wanted to see what the laughter in the dormitory was for.

So I have always liked it and will still relive it.

When it initially aired I was a kid and when it ended I was around 18. Being an artist myself starting around that time I was just not too much into sitcoms. Kind of felt it's too dumb for me and silly. Which is naive.

Now I am in my later 30s and had some sort of creative career too and find myself struggling too. Alcohol and other substances have always be a part of my life ever since I was around 16. The show manages to make me feel good right now. Or at least better and gives me hope to get up the next day and start to go for some things I didn't take care of for over a year.

Matthew Perry wanted to be remembered for helping people and I think in a weird way he does help me right now. It is still sad to see him in these different stages throughout the show knowing what's going on. With all these guest stars that up to this day still look great and healthy it is really sad to see such a nice, talented, funny and special guy deteriorate as much as he did. If he would've had more control or help or whatever he could still be up there.

So as a young man I thought this show was too stupid for me. But this show is about people and everyday life problems, love, work, friendship, family and everything between. It is a milestone of a sitcom after all these ALF's, Cosby's and Bel Air's. Clearly influenced later shows such as HYMYM or the Big Bang Theory.

78,78,6.0,23 March 2004,"Easily in my top five category of funniest and best shows in prime time history.

Everyone on this show is so witty and delivers their lines superbly that it's hard not to like all of them equally. However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.

We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.

Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:

Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show. I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.

Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green:

Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7. Who is that, you ask? Well, obviously Ross Gellar. Her roommate Monica's brother. Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine. Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more. But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.

Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:

It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy. But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.

Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey:

Now, I love Lisa Kudrow. She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show. She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.

David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:

It's so funny to me that I like him so much. He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show. He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines. He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.

Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:

They should have a shrine dedicated to this man. He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on! He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented. I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance. If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.

So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10. It's one of the best shows to come out within the last ten years, and definitely on my top five best shows of all time list.

80,80,10.0,2 October 2010,"Suffice it to say that Friends is a classic comic treatment of what I have always called the ""post-college adolescent phase"" of life, which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life. It is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health, the most freedom, the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income, and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with. This phase ends when you ""settle down"" both career-wise and family-wise, and I always found Friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor.

It follows the life of six young people living in New York City from 1994 to 2004, so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale, but the relationship truths never will be. Ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking. Ross' sister Monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school. Rachel has been Monica's friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddy's credit card when the series begins, and is looking for a career in fashion. Chandler, Ross' friend since college, is successful in his budding career in business. Rounding out the group is Joey, not the brightest bulb in the room, who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a TV show. Finally there is Phoebe. Her history with the group doesn't go much past the beginning of the series as she's had a rather Bohemian upbringing that has led to a Bohemian adulthood. Complicating factor as the series begins - Ross' wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman, Ross now and always has had a crush on Rachel who doesn't know he's alive, and Ross' wife discovers she is pregnant by Ross shortly after the separation.

One of the best shows on TV with the most heart and the most laughs. Highly recommended.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",suffice it to say that friends is a classic comic treatment of what i have always called the postcollege adolescent phase of life which is roughly the ten years immediately following college graduation as you strike out on your own and try to find your place in life it is the time in life when you are likely to have the best health the most freedom the most disposable income if not necessarily the most total income and the most fun if you are fortunate enough to have people to share it all with this phase ends when you settle down both careerwise and familywise and i always found friends to track this time in life quite accurately and with both drama and great humor it follows the life of six young people living in new york city from to so even now a few of the cultural references will be stale but the relationship truths never will be ross is the nerdy guy who grew up to be a little uncomfortable in his skin but still very good looking ross sister monica is an aspiring chef who is now thin but was obese up until the middle of high school rachel has been monicas friend since high school and is adjusting to life without daddys credit card when the series begins and is looking for a career in fashion chandler ross friend since college is successful in his budding career in business rounding out the group is joey not the brightest bulb in the room who wants to be an actor and as a result works a series of odd jobs and stars in a series of odder commercials and the occasional appearance on a tv show finally there is phoebe her history with the group doesnt go much past the beginning of the series as shes had a rather bohemian upbringing that has led to a bohemian adulthood complicating factor as the series begins ross wife has just declared she is gay and left him for another woman ross now and always has had a crush on rachel who doesnt know hes alive and ross wife discovers she is pregnant by ross shortly after the separation one of the best shows on tv with the most heart and the most laughs highly recommended,POSITIVE

84,84,10.0,22 January 2021,"I strongly believe I am the biggest fan and viewer of friends. I even feel like one of them at times when I am watching. I know all the words, the facial expressions of an even tell what each actor was thinking at the time. We all feel apart of it for our own personal reasons. That's half the reason we watched it. But the worst feeling was when they stopped making them and all actors broke character in the last episode. A really sad moment? More like traumatic moment.

It's hard to pick a favourite as I could compare myself to any of them at times. You could say the show wouldn't be the same without Joey, he made things more fun yet some would say he's stupid. You could say Rachel was the best but she was easy, annoying, stuck up and spoilt. Honestly Jennifer is the sole reason friends actually stopped saying she didn't want to do it. Then Ross; with his geeky but mature and sophisticated dialogue. I don't think anyone can ever beat Matthew Perry though. I believe that his performance was the best on screen I've ever seen on a show. Truthful answer is all of them in their own way were the best. The chemistry, bond, fun, wit - well this won't ever be beaten. Big Bang theory, will and grace, the office, how inlet your mother must all of them awful shows have no baring on friends at all.

I've heard plenty of people say friends was another boring sit down comedy - I hate them people. Friends comforted people in their hours of need, on the death bed, break ups, hardship, all through life. It meant so much. Yes there were too many episodes fixated on dating, too many oh my gods, some of the jokes weren't funny or proportioned. So generally this could have been better. But still. It's friends. Unbeatable in every way. To this day it won't die this show came at a time before social media was taking off. This was so real people spoke to each other, girls were happy being flirted with in person not hiding behind snap chat filters for likes.

86,86,10.0,3 February 2021,"Unfortunately friends is not my favorite show anymore. I started watching it recently after years of not even seeing a single episode and I just didn't find it as funny from the beginning. My favorite shows of all time right now are Seinfeld, the office, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Barry, and curb your enthusiasm. These shoes have made me laugh so hard and the writing just seems incredible at times. But then I watched friends because I had an HBO max subscription recently and decided to watch one of my favorite seasons which is season five. I don't know how to explain it but it just didn't seem very comical. I still love the characters and I don't think any of them are a bad actors in anyway and I don't even think that the writing is bad...there was just something about the type of humor that I'm just not used to anymore. I try to think that back in the day when friends was on live television I definitely would have been a fan who waited for the next episode to air and got ready to watch it with excitement. And that's pretty much the only thing I can imagine to try and keep myself from disliking the show. For now I'm just going to say it's just not the best anymore. Sorry! I will still have this show up there in maybe the top 20 just because it really did have great entertainment for viewers at the time of watching it while airing.

This is one of the most contrived shows ever produced. I have to assume that the people who find this series so riveting only do so to live vicariously through the lives of the characters. Either that or they are immature yuppie wannabees whose sensibilities have been compromised by gamma rays. The effusiveness of most of the positive reviews made me want to throw up.

Friends"" reeks of nauseating sexual innuendos that are spat out like projectiles from a tennis ball machine.

When it comes to dealing with sex, ""Cheers"", Frasier"" and ""Seinfeld"" were far more clever, witty and intelligent. ""Seinfeld"" co-creator Larry David wanted his show's humor to be based largely on real experiences. The show broke one barrier after another and either originated or popularized numerous expressions. ""Seinfeld's"" sexual humor was clever and original; on ""Friends"" it was on the same level as smut.

On ""Cheers,"" Ted Danson as babe hound Sam Malone was far more endearing than any of the male characters on ""Friends."" The show never ran out of hilarious one-liners, which was quite a feat considering that the show didn't often venture outside the confines of a bar.

""Frasier"" was both cerebral and jocular (how many TV shows make references to the Algonquin Round Table?) Kelsey Grammar's Frasier Crane was sidesplitting as he pursued one failed relationship after another, but he never descended to the low-level sexual innuendos that were characteristic of ""Friends.""

103,103,10.0,8 September 2019,"The series ""Friends"" is, in my opinion, an amazing phenomenon of its time. And this phenomenon is alive after two decades. After all, a huge army of fans does not dry up, but only replenishes with each new viewer. What began as a Comedy has grown into a life, a drama with excellent acting, a great story, and, most importantly, with characters you know as yourself, love and consider them your friends.

Each character from six unique. It has a rich history that we learn from series to series. Each character has its pros and cons, recognizable phrases, phrases, behaviors. But still their every step is unpredictable, and the situation in which they find themselves, just gorgeous to colic with laughter.

Anyone can recognize them if you give them a name. Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe and Joey. Each love and each is somehow manages not to make. That's good. Means,

the characters are cleverly written. They make you laugh, empathize, sometimes really afraid for their future. And so a series of for a series of the viewer imbued with this energy, is beginning to use their phrase in his life, are discussing heroes and situation later even years. Is this not worldwide recognition?

This is an amazing journey, where the viewer seems to be not such, living together with the heroes of their joy and adversity. The series raises important questions, but it is done in such a way that you understand for yourself that there are no hopeless situations. Every problem is solved.

The acting is amazing. They are lively, dynamic, dramatic and of course funny. With them you wait for a meeting, they are ready to help in difficult moments when you revise series, you plunge into problems and really you begin to see the solution and the problems. ""Friends"" inspire.

However, if you're going to rest on your laurels, and bring nothing new to the table, you should at least do a damn good job of it.

117,117,10.0,22 August 2024,"Friends, which aired from 1994 to 2004, stands as one of the most enduring and influential sitcoms in television history. Centered around six close friends in New York City, this series has carved out a special place in viewers' hearts through its sweet humor, profound human connections, and exceptional character development.

One of the show's greatest strengths lies in its unparalleled character development. The characters-Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe-each possess unique traits that allow viewers to connect with them on a personal level. The human relationships depicted are so genuine and relatable that audiences quickly feel like they are part of this close-knit group of friends. These connections are portrayed with a beautiful complexity, making the audience deeply invested in the characters' lives.

The humor in Friends is another key factor that has cemented its place as a timeless series. The comedic situations are not only entertaining but often so hilarious that they induce genuine laughter. These comedic moments, especially when the characters are involved in everyday problems and unexpected events, are vividly portrayed and contribute greatly to the show's charm.

Music also plays a significant role in Friends. From the iconic theme song that instantly brings the series to mind to the various pieces played throughout the episodes, the music is perfectly aligned with the show's tone and atmosphere. These musical elements not only enhance the overall mood but also reinforce the emotional connections between the viewers and the characters.

However, perhaps the greatest reason for the success of Friends is the outstanding performances of its cast. The actors delivered their best work in this series, achieving a level of success they have not replicated in other projects. The exceptional chemistry and harmony among the cast members make every moment of the show engaging and memorable.

Friends is not just a successful comedy series; it has also connected with various generations of viewers by depicting everyday life and its challenges. The show has excelled in portraying friendships and romantic relationships, which is why it continues to captivate audiences even after many years.

135,135,10.0,3 November 2023,"'Friends' is an American TV sitcom, based on the lives of six best friends living in New York City. Throughout the course of 10 years and 10 seasons, these friends go through life lessons, family, love, drama, comedy, and most importantly friendship. Created by David Crane and Martha Kauffman.

'Friends' holds a very special and sentimental place in my heart. I was first introduced to the series a few years ago, after a close friend of mine had recommended the show to me.

There is something about this series that is so addictive and rewatchable. Every time I decide to watch it through, I almost have a new experience with it. Maybe that's because I can now relate to a scenario that I didn't before. Or a joke that I may have missed at first is now really funny. Regardless of it coming out so long ago. I believe this series still holds up really well.

I think there is something so special and unique about seeing newcomers discovering this series and becoming just as hooked as everybody else. Don't get me wrong, I was born after the show had wrapped and I love it. 'Friends' brings me so much comfort and is great for a 'bad day cure'.

Chandler is the guy whom i love the most in the show. He is simply outstanding in his one liners and the sarcasm..Joey just cracks me up. He's like the cool guy with whom everybody loves to hang out with. Even though you know that Rachel is supposed to be with Ross but when Joey falls in love with Rachel, you just cannot stop rooting for joey to be with her. That was really a heartbreaking episode.

The episode where chandler proposes, the one where Rachel and Ross get together for the first time, the one where U2 song was played, were all extremely special episodes. It just broke my heart when the show ended and i cant describe how much i wish that the show would start again.

149,149,2.0,6 October 2015,"Looking back on the run of the TV series ""Friends"", it is easy to see why it was so popular. The casting gave America six young adults who actually felt like they were our friends. On each episode, after its catchy theme song by The Rembrandts, we got to visit with a cast of such well developed characters who we liked:

Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) is the beautiful, yet accessible and funny, girl who became a style setter. The country followed her hairstyles and the drama of her ever-evolving relationship with Ross.

Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) is the nerdy PhD who struggled with the timing of his relationships, managing to marry and divorce before finally getting a shot at the love of his life, Rachel. In my opinion, Aniston and Swimmer were the talents that elevated this show beyond good to great. When you watch their performances, their comic timing is perfect and their characterizations feel true.

Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is Ross' sister and the neurotic neat freak who still bears scars from her younger fat days. Besides some very interesting relationships, she eventually marries another one of the friends. She is hyper-competitive, especially when it comes to games or sports.

Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is the class clown. Could anyone BE any funnier? His bromance with Joey is the center of his life until he falls for Monica.

Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is the clueless actor who knows how to score with women (""How YOU doin'?"") and shares his passions for games and ""Baywatch"" with Chandler.

Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) is the kooky folk singer with a penchant for writing odd songs, like ""Smelly Cat."" She has a twin sister who is also ""out there"", and an unusual past.

The writers for this show had some great talent to write for, but the writing itself always gave us funny premises, great ongoing gags, and the occasional touching moment.

157,157,10.0,13 October 2010,"Friends is one of my favourite TV shows. I have to admit that I hardly watched it at all when it first aired. That maybe because I was still going to elementary school and high school then. After that I began to watch the re-runs, and found it to be very appealing. I was looking for some comedy, and got plenty of it from Friends. I guess the big reason why I didn't want to watch the show at first was because it's so popular (the leads are famous too). The series was very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings.

The show's biggest appeal is the humor. You can always count that each episode will have at least a decent amount of humor. Most episodes are just hilarious! After I watched the entire first season I began to care about the characters. The series revolves around a group of friends in the area of Manhattan, New York City, who live together and share living expenses. I'm not going to go into which of the six leads I like the most because I like them all. They all get a chance to shine throughout the show. However, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer are definite standouts. They're good in their roles, and are often very funny. Friends also has a memorable cast of supporting characters. I especially liked Monica's and Ross's parents, Rachel's father, Richard, Janice, Rachel's sister Amy, Mike Hannigan, and Phoebe's boyfriend David.

The series starts off strong. In the first few seasons the main relationships form, and there's a good bit of drama too. The middle is probably my favourite part mostly because it's the funniest. And although the show does become a bit repetitive and goofy by the end, I still found it to be very entertaining. In all, there were 10 seasons with 236 episodes. The finale was watched by about 53 million American viewers, making it the fourth most watched series finale in TV history. Friends has made a large cultural impact, and the Central Perk coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue to air worldwide. Throughout its run, the series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards.

One of the most important things that makes any story great is the characters, and Friends has six good ones. By the end, I liked the show so much that I didn't want it to end. I now have the DVDs so I can watch it anytime, and often do. Rumours have surfaced of a film. Most of the lead actors expressed interest in starring in the film, but for now the film is just a rumour because nothing's final yet. If you haven't seen Friends yet then don't hesitate to do so.

158,158,6.0,24 July 2010,"Greatest sitcom and just TV series in the universe pure and simple Friends had the best cast, the best writers and the best fans.

Most of the time the comedy was smart and edgy, often crude and immature, everyone loved friends because there was something for everyone. Show about nothing, just six friends hanging around going through life together, slipping up, making mistakes and finding their purpose.

159,159,4.0,27 December 2005,"I'm not going to waste my time or yours writing a plot summary to open my review of this series because everyone knows how it began and the convoluted paths it has taken within the group of characters is too hard to capture in a few sentences. Friends made millionaires of the cast (each week), saved channel 4 from having to find something to fill about 50 hours of air time each week and will continue to be sold in slightly different DVD box sets for decades to come for reasons I don't totally understand (doesn't every fan have it now?). However I must admit that I don't like it and never really got what made it stand out from all the other undemanding American ""cute twentysomethings"" sitcoms that clutter the schedules.

The relationships are the key to holding the stories together and it bothered me that I was never really convinced by any of them. The various romances come and go with about as much comic confusion as a whale could barely stomach while everyone cracks jokes and one-liners all the time. Many of these are quite funny but only by sitcom standards  some television shows break moulds and explore new ground (successfully or not) whereas some shows are just very polished and professional genre machines. ""Friends"" is the latter and just because it does it well doesn't mean it is somehow a television event. The undemanding predictability of the whole thing is probably one reason it was successful; the way it gives people a warm sense of being part of a group of friends may have been another. But for me one of the biggest reasons it work was just how straight an arrow it fired  very safe, very white, very clean, very warm, very American.

The coffee shop is a fine example of what I mean. Despite living upstairs, the friends all like to get together in this comfy, well-lit place, drinking big cups of coffee and laughing together. Sometimes they have jobs, sometimes they don't but if money troubles are experienced then they are temporary and comical. The problems they experience in life are less about loss and pain brought about by their own character failings, and more about leaving their laundry somewhere amusing etc. Of course it is a sitcom and you want all this stuff so, like I said, it is very clean, very safe and so on. Personally I tend to prefer dramas when it comes to television, just because I enjoy depth, I enjoy complexity and I do not think for one minute that life is like ""Friends"" for anybody, although I can see why viewers clung to its ideal.

The cast are pretty and perform their undemanding stuff well enough to produce bland characters that hopefully all the viewers will like. None of them are actually that good but they are good enough for the genre and the product. Aniston inspired a haircut but not me; she is pretty if you are attracted to safe, bland women  which I suppose a lot of people are. I always found Cox prettier and more able to get a bit of personality into her role and she was better for it. Kudrow was just annoying and was normally on the edge of the group  time (and some well chosen projects) has shown her to actually move past Friends looking best. Schwimmer's neurotic Jew was never going to be original and it wasn't  he works it well but his rather wet, bland performance only works when Aniston matches it. Perry I liked but only because his humour is closer to mine than the others; of course his stuff does get annoying quickly and the fact that he seems unable to do anything else just adds to it. LeBlanc suits sitcom world and at least has had the sense to just stay there (although the idea that his dumb spin-off was ever going to be Frasier is a bit rich).

Don't get me wrong though; overall this is a fine bit of American sitcom. Why it has done so well I don't really know but if I did I'd be copying it and chasing every dollar I could get.

164,164,10.0,29 March 2008,"I have a severe problem with this show, several actually. A simple list will suffice for now, I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.

If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new, good shows (Arrested Development, Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV, ""Two And A Half Men"" and ""The King Of Queens"" as the television executives. Now then, on with the review.

These characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right, cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.

The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be ""comedy"" requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office, Arrested Development).

This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great, it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development.

I have watched very little of ""Friends"" in my life, but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have a severe problem with this show several actually a simple list will suffice for now ill go into more depth later on superficial characters a laughtrack and boring humour if you dont wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior as if you see anything in this show i didnt to a frequently irked teen from canada ill summarize friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new good shows arrested development dexter etc friends is as much to blame for reality tv two and a half men and the king of queens as the television executives now then on with the review these characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way outside of gender and hair colour they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it why isnt rachel storming out on monica after monica starts hanging out with rachels enemy why doesnt joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously oh right cause hes the dumb one and hes comfortable with that this is the curse of having perfect characters lasting conflict and god forbid personality becomes an impossibility the laughtrack is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny how can i make such a broad generalization when a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity see the office arrested development this leads to my next point the humour is boring there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous without a laughtrack apparently simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws so what if monica dated a year old she immediately recognizes that what she is doing isnt right and breaks up with him there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him that would be great it would be like a custody battle so now ive provided evidence for my position many of my friends love this show because they havent heard of curb your enthusiasm or arrested development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development i have watched very little of friends in my life but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable if youve read this far thank you and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned,NEGATIVE

175,175,10.0,25 June 2007,"I am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Haven't said that Friends was, at best an 'average' sitcom, and not as great as others have made out. Let's face it, if it wasn't for the casting of Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done. I very much doubt that. Although as the series progressed, Friends got more progressively predictable, lame and boring that I couldn't care less about the characters- of whom are the most overrated in TV history- or of their plight, nor of who was sleeping with whom. And it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny. And even when it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't bother to tune in. The writing in Friends became stale that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season onwards and as for the ending, well it was predictable to say the least.

What was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons, whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three, four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good. The show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger salaries. In truth, as much as the series waned, it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way round.

When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now, there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our TV screens very soon.

176,176,10.0,18 February 2019,"Should you even be looking up a review? :D This show is my absolute favourite one which I watch every day. A story of 6 friends who in their early 20s are trying to make it on the outskirts of New York City. All of these 6 friends have different personality traits and even so they are the thickest of friends. They have different family backgrounds and with their stash of insecurities they manage to live a life around it sometimes with the help of their friends. They can be vulnerable and open with each other which makes them family!! They grow over the years with experience and the show has moments where some characters think in retrospect feeling fulfilled but at the same time new challenges erupt and they draw hope from seeing how far they have come.

I have listened to some people claiming how friends is just a bunch of losers who sit over at the coffee shop and whine about life. But I disagree and say that it's much more than that. They do not always whine and complain. They support and cheer on each other. Help each other with their shortcoming and fears. They are genuinely happy when their friend is happy and sad when their friend is sad. One would be lucky to have one good friend in this age and time.

194,194,10.0,13 August 2002,"It's an abysmal show. I've never ever got the popularity of this, especially outside of America.

In each of the last 3 houses I've lived in over the last 10 years at least one person in each house has been an avid 'Friends' fan, so I am fully exposed to it, and have seen many episodes. It's also on tele every day.

Where do I start? The title is as good a place as any. I can imagine the producers discussing that: ""Right, we've got a comedy about a group of friends, we need a name? How about Friends"" If that's the imagination it doesn't leave much hope for the story lines.

I know it's a lighthearted sit com but come on? How old are they supposed to be? They were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series 1, here we are ten years later & nothings changed. They're all approaching the big 40! yet they're still living the lives of 18 year olds.

And how the hell do they afford those penthouses? They change their jobs like I change my underpants, Monica worked in a kitchen, Joey can't get any acting work. The rent would be thousands.

Friends is nothing more than the equally benal & tedious 'Saved by the Bell' but for grown-ups. It's the old flogged-to-death ""Three guys, three girls, all stunningly gorgeous, occasionally fancy or sleep with each other & with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group.""

The only thing funny about about Friends is unintentionally funny. Those parties they occasionally have in their flat (penthouse). The so called guests they invite, who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in & pass themselves off as close companions of the characters, when it's clear to the entire watching world that they've met for the first time at the start of the shot.

It's a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem. It's the most unrealistic portrayal of New York in history. No black people, Chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter, even with minor parts. It's New York! One of the most multi cultural cities on the planet.

Admittedly there is one funny aspect I have omitted. Chandler. The guy is enormously talented, makes the entire show, and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is.

Rachel & Monica are likable characters & not annoying, but nor are they funny. But the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man. Come on? Please. Don't treat the viewer as a two year old.

Joey is likable but is given no script to work with. Too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing. Wrong. Trigger is Only Fools & Horses was thick but funny with it, because of the timing. He's comments were made at exactly the right time. Joey's are not, & unfortunately for a good actor & potentially very good character, he comes over more as irritating than anything else.

But the real problem with Friends are in Ross & Phoebe. The only applicable description of Ross is that he needs a good kick up the back-side, to put some oomf (?) into the bloke. He's a drip. He just drones on & on in that slow dull manner, series after series. In any real life situation a Ross & a Rachel would just not be a couple. A Rachel & a Brad Pitt would be a couple, somewhat appropriately.

But even he can't beat Phoebe for irritation. It's not the actress at all that's the problem, it's 100% the character. I just don't get her. The Floor Manager must hold up the ""Laugh Now"" board for the audience after every line she says. For the life of me, I just don't know what she says that is funny.

And in the equally irritating coffee lounge. (Why are the sofas always empty? Never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move), those scenes where she plays her guitar. I've been to funerals funnier than them. All she does is sing in coherent songs that don't rhyme, or make any sense whatsoever. Anyone could write a sketch like that.

I also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door. No-one I know would put up with that, even from their Grandparents. Nor people who say ""Hey"" instead of Hello, but thats getting as tedious as the show now.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",its an abysmal show ive never ever got the popularity of this especially outside of america in each of the last houses ive lived in over the last years at least one person in each house has been an avid friends fan so i am fully exposed to it and have seen many episodes its also on tele every day where do i start the title is as good a place as any i can imagine the producers discussing that right weve got a comedy about a group of friends we need a name how about friends if thats the imagination it doesnt leave much hope for the story lines i know its a lighthearted sit com but come on how old are they supposed to be they were too old for that sort of lifestyle in series here we are ten years later nothings changed theyre all approaching the big yet theyre still living the lives of year olds and how the hell do they afford those penthouses they change their jobs like i change my underpants monica worked in a kitchen joey cant get any acting work the rent would be thousands friends is nothing more than the equally benal tedious saved by the bell but for grownups its the old floggedtodeath three guys three girls all stunningly gorgeous occasionally fancy or sleep with each other with no friends whatsoever outside of their little group the only thing funny about about friends is unintentionally funny those parties they occasionally have in their flat penthouse the so called guests they invite who stand in the background desperately trying to fit in pass themselves off as close companions of the characters when its clear to the entire watching world that theyve met for the first time at the start of the shot its a combination of many little things that contribute to the problem its the most unrealistic portrayal of new york in history no black people chinese or anyone ethnic for that matter even with minor parts its new york one of the most multi cultural cities on the planet admittedly there is one funny aspect i have omitted chandler the guy is enormously talented makes the entire show and seems solely responsible for what laughs or comedy there is rachel monica are likable characters not annoying but nor are they funny but the past stories of either of them not being able to get a man come on please dont treat the viewer as a two year old joey is likable but is given no script to work with too many comedies think that by putting a thick character in they will automatically be amusing wrong trigger is only fools horses was thick but funny with it because of the timing hes comments were made at exactly the right time joeys are not unfortunately for a good actor potentially very good character he comes over more as irritating than anything else but the real problem with friends are in ross phoebe the only applicable description of ross is that he needs a good kick up the backside to put some oomf into the bloke hes a drip he just drones on on in that slow dull manner series after series in any real life situation a ross a rachel would just not be a couple a rachel a brad pitt would be a couple somewhat appropriately but even he cant beat phoebe for irritation its not the actress at all thats the problem its the character i just dont get her the floor manager must hold up the laugh now board for the audience after every line she says for the life of me i just dont know what she says that is funny and in the equally irritating coffee lounge why are the sofas always empty never once have they had to sit somewhere else or wait for some other people to move those scenes where she plays her guitar ive been to funerals funnier than them all she does is sing in coherent songs that dont rhyme or make any sense whatsoever anyone could write a sketch like that i also cannot sit through any show where people walk into other people houses without knocking on the door noone i know would put up with that even from their grandparents nor people who say hey instead of hello but thats getting as tedious as the show now,NEGATIVE
196,196,10.0,20 May 2008,"Friends is about 6 Friends who live in New York and have to solve all of life's problems to sex, to relationships, to... well... basically thats what its all about.

The idea contains the same old friendships, relationship, babies, love, marriage, job, and materialism. Nothing to contribute to society... never once I see the characters face real problems of debt, psychological torture, or identity crisis (Like Chandler experiencing what being Gay feels like for a day, or Rachel hanging with the poor. Or even Phoebe living in an asylum?) And about the racial cultures... Usually I never see them date anyone else other than a few colors to ""liven"" the space. Oh, the token black person that comes out one or two episodes is not helping either. Seeing as New York is full of culture, they made it look like the other races are not important.

Their lifestyle is perfect. They crapped money out of their really low-paying jobs and spend most of their time well, sipping their coffee, stalking about that hot guy or girl and plans to bang them later to the episode, ending with a break-up for the dumbest of reasons.

Aside from Chandler, their jobs are almost impossible to ask why their apartments costs more than what they earn. Well, Monica has ""rent control"" but hey... no one tried to kick her out yet... Ross is still controlling his money after all the divorces he has been in. Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe gave a speech on not taking charity, but hey, they suck the living breeches of the first three and claiming paying them back was almost impossible.

Okay, off with the plots, let's go to the characters...

Character analysis: Chandler - He is apparently one of the more humorous characters. He is a sample of a realistic person who we can hang out in the office or sip some coffee or something. I don't have problems with him and Monica together, to the dismay of all the true-blue Frendsian fans.

Phoebe - I like her for being a bit different in the first few seasons... but then after a while, she started being horny, annoying, and kind of a hypocrite. Okay, so she has a hard life... but people like her in real life, struggle to be as normal as possible. She just left that philosophy behind because of it. It's not even trying until the tenth season or so...

Monica - She isn't a funny character, but she has been a person who actually is believable in ways that she is right, and she is apparently the mature one. Sadly, she is usually looked down upon because her other Friends think that her style is annoying. Sadly, her baby-freak, ""I can be like anyone else"" philosophy threw me off after like season one. I always wondered why she wasn't kicked out of the circle.

Rachel - I hate her. She hasn't changed ever since day one, to be honest. Her personality is this ""Me-Me-Me!"" spoiled brat who went to the city, and a few jobs and a million boyfriends later... it's still all about ""Me!"" The relationship with her and Ross was somewhat annoying for and a mood killer for almost forever, and almost in the last episode of the series, BANG! They're together again. Can Ross just leave or slap Rachel for all the horrible things she has done to him? Oh Noooo... because Ross is too in ""loooove"" with Rachel... Reasons were almost to no idea... Having sexual thoughts with Chandler and almost having a short, useless hit-off with Joey was also not helping.

Ross - I pitied his first season philosophy and hey, I liked him for being at least sympathetic there... just that he had two additional divorces that he became a screaming, yelling, irritating person who is smart and intelligent, yet acts dumb and immature for his age. The whole Rachel thing is lost of chemistry and yeah, they were on a break. Rachel is apparently responsible for all of the things that happened to them and then claiming after the whole fiasco that the writers make it say that it's Ross' fault anyway for Rachel's doing. Ross would be better off on a suicide for being with a devil woman.

Joey - Dumb Actor who doesn't do anything to contribute to society. Oh yeah, his spin off may be the worst thing anyone has ever made... Even if I can feel things from the characters. He is a handsome guy, that's a contribution right? And Him having sex with 500 girls is considered a real good thing. In general, actors have to research their roles, and Joey... he just swoops in Shakespeare because hey... He's an actor!

To conclude, I have been annoyed by the show... and I get why people love it so much. It's the art of Escapism of them in a Fantasy world that makes everyone love them so. But sadly, I have watched shows that actually make use of real life as a humor tool that makes Friends forgettable for me. For ten years, nothing truly EVER happened.. and parodies like ""Furends"" are apparently more of a short version of the whole rant.

210,210,10.0,17 May 2010,"""Friends"" is one of those television shows that you just can't define and not because it's so great and original that words don't exist to capture it, but rather because it's so ordinary and it succeeded.

6 twenty-something friends trying to navigate life, jobs, and romance sure doesn't sound original and it's not. It's not ground-breaking in any way except for the fact that it basically united and defined a generation for almost no explicable reason. Almost every single person who grew up with the friends, can now relate every daily occurrence in their lives to an episode of the show. The show wasn't even that realistic, but all of the actors added a warmth and accessibility to each of their characters, that we hung on to every word, found comfort in their flaws, and craved that they found what they wanted.

The characters weren't even that well written.

-- Newton N Minow, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, speech before the National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, DC, May 9, 1961

We were warned.

""Friends"" may be the worst thing I've ever seen on televsion and I've been sitting in front of the tube observing the ""great wasteland"" since 1954.

Obviously there are those who love the show because it was a hit for a decade. It's happened before. There are wildly successful and formulaic TV series that just don't seemed to die despite their lack of merit. (""Murder, She Wrote"", ""Charlie's Angels"", ""Providence"")

""Friends"" simply does not stack up well to other, contemporary series. It lacks the smartness of ""Seinfeld"" and the wonderful self-ridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of ""Frasier"". The characters in ""Friends"" seem designed to make them repellant dullards. This incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl.

The unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort. The characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric -- though intentionally so. (It might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of ""Friends"".)

This shallow, unfunny, tedious, predictable moneymaker seems to be designed for a certain demographic slice which might be those folks born around 1975. (If this seems to be a backhanded whack at the ""X"" Generation that finds itself equally mesmerized by computer games, I'm sorry. However, if the shoe fits...)

The entertainment industry is smart and delicately fine-tuned to the acquisition of a dollar which is why producers live and die by weekly ratings. They will craftily provide specific segments of the public precisely what they want. The industry understood that this banal gruel would fare well and it has. The only defense for this series, I believe, is that it's CALCULATED to be bad by providing a mirror to people who are as lacking in depth and humor as the characters in ""Friends"". Water, like people, seeks its own level.

Thank goodness even the actors are now tired of performing in this repulsive show.

If upon the demise of the series the time slot were filled with a cooking show, it would nonetheless be a great improvement.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i invite you to sit down in front of your television set when your station goes on the airand keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off i can assure uou that you will observe a great wasteland newton n minow chairman of the federal communications commission speech before the national association of broadcasters washington dc may we were warned friends may be the worst thing ive ever seen on televsion and ive been sitting in front of the tube observing the great wasteland since obviously there are those who love the show because it was a hit for a decade its happened before there are wildly successful and formulaic tv series that just dont seemed to die despite their lack of merit murder she wrote charlies angels providence friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the smartness of seinfeld and the wonderful selfridicule of pomposity that is the hallmark of frasier the characters in friends seem designed to make them repellant dullards this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric though intentionally so it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their capabilities so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends this shallow unfunny tedious predictable moneymaker seems to be designed for a certain demographic slice which might be those folks born around if this seems to be a backhanded whack at the x generation that finds itself equally mesmerized by computer games im sorry however if the shoe fits the entertainment industry is smart and delicately finetuned to the acquisition of a dollar which is why producers live and die by weekly ratings they will craftily provide specific segments of the public precisely what they want the industry understood that this banal gruel would fare well and it has the only defense for this series i believe is that its calculated to be bad by providing a mirror to people who are as lacking in depth and humor as the characters in friends water like people seeks its own level thank goodness even the actors are now tired of performing in this repulsive show if upon the demise of the series the time slot were filled with a cooking show it would nonetheless be a great improvement,NEGATIVE

The reason why it was one of the most succesful sitcom in its genre and is still being broadcasted in countries around the world is that everybody can relate to it one way or the other.

The topics of each episodes is all about life during your 20s and 30s. Boyfriends/girlfriends, career, family issues, money, bills, ups & downs, it is all being discussed in Friends.

Compared to many many blockbuster comedies or other sitcoms, also listed by those who dislike friends, the humor in friends can be even somewhat brilliant and while certainly there are bad/idiotic jokes in the show, tell me one show or comedy that doesn't have them.

In addition, I just have to mention that in my opinion Matthew Perry is far above all other actors in this series, his way of acting and his great ability to be sarcastic in an extremely funny way make him a character who rarely leaves me without good laughs.

261,261,10.0,5 August 2010,"To me Friends is the most overrated show. The humor is weak and unintelligent, and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is la-la land. Other than these major flaws, the show is just missing something else that many other comedy's have, and I think it's the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor. Other shows like Weeds and The United States of Tara are comical, but also have a strong plot and theme. I think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable, but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and society's problems. Even shows like Arrested Development and Grounded For Life apply more to the ""good comedy but strong plot and theme.""

And if the writer or director's goal was not to have a dramatic plot, then they should have some warm meaning to the show. For example, Full House, The Nanny, and Golden Girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages. The importance of family support in Full House, how true friends will always help you in Golden Girls, and how a full-time care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as The Nanny. I think Friends tries too much to be like a Seinfeld for teens and young adults. However, Seinfeld has much better writing and humor.

Every time I watched this show it always ended up boring me. I really don't understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",to me friends is the most overrated show the humor is weak and unintelligent and the characters try too hard to be funny and act like everything is lala land other than these major flaws the show is just missing something else that many other comedys have and i think its the lack of a good or serious plot along with humor other shows like weeds and the united states of tara are comical but also have a strong plot and theme i think the comedy in those shows makes it light in some ways and watchable but also these shows are brilliant by highlighting individual people and societys problems even shows like arrested development and grounded for life apply more to the good comedy but strong plot and theme and if the writer or directors goal was not to have a dramatic plot then they should have some warm meaning to the show for example full house the nanny and golden girls had a lot of the humor but gave great messages the importance of family support in full house how true friends will always help you in golden girls and how a fulltime care take for children can really help a family and bring out the best in children whose parents are absent such as the nanny i think friends tries too much to be like a seinfeld for teens and young adults however seinfeld has much better writing and humor every time i watched this show it always ended up boring me i really dont understand why people like this show so much where there is so much better comedy television out there,NEGATIVE

The only reason friends gets a seven star for me is because of Chandler-his dialogue delivery and his romantic endeavors (especially Kathy & Monica).

The acting is unrealistic yet not funny. You, as a viewer, can't take the show seriously, but it also does not have absurdistic humor in any form. That makes the show extremely uninteresting.

They always play extremely safe with the jokes and they are all mediocre and cliché. The laughing track is really needed because without it it would not be clear which moments are supposed to be 'funny'.

The thing it has got going for it however is its ability to draw people in. It's essentially comfort TV. Watching it doesn't require any effort at all, you just sit back and enjoy. With the best comedies, the office for example, there's the idea that you have to work a little to get some of the jokes. You have to be able to extract the joke for the full effect. With friends they simply present it to you and you simply take it in, no thought or effort required. It's easy to relate to on some levels, but sometimes their problems are simply comedy situations rather than ones you would come across in life. The wit isn't groundbreaking but is reliable to keep you going without annoying you. While its neither the ideal comedy or ideal drama it is a perfect example of comfort TV.

It's one of the most childish show I 've ever had the mischance to watch it (I lied here, I watch it because I wanted to - I want to see what others found funny). First of all, the annoying laughter in the background every time an actor says a line is just stupid and annoying(in every line?) and spoils everything, even if it were an actual clever line. That means they point out the 'funny part' so the viewer knows where is the joke and laugh like a programmed robot. It is moronic to laugh when someone hint the funny part, think about it.

Secondly, every character behave like a little child. I can't see any adult behavior here. Have you ever see a woman with a decent amount of IQ in her head, to try catch the flu because they told her that she sing better with a gruff voice? And not just that, the director loved that part and decided to repeat it scene after scene! Stupid exaggerated pointless jokes every two seconds by people who can't really act and make childish comments and grimaces all the time. Maybe people like it because its cool to memorize the 'funny' (I wince every time I write that word here) phrases. But if they repeat it few times in their head and actual think what they are saying, they could easily understand that's just plain moronic.

326,326,6.0,24 September 2007,"How do I hate ""Friends""? Let me count the ways:

Firstly, it rated an ""F"" with the test audience (don't believe me, check The Smoking Gun).

Secondly, it ran 10 years without being remotely funny ONCE (beating the record held by the completely laugh-free 8 year run of Full House, which, like this crap, was produced by a division of the Time Warner media empire, had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major American city, bland-looking guy of Mediterranean descent trying to get into show business, and a dumb guy named Joey).

Third, that horrible theme makes NSync sound like The Beatles.

Fourth, the cast couldn't act its way out of a paper bag (I thank one of the other posters for pointing out that Jennifer ""I'm not a star, I just sleep with them"" Aniston is Telly Savalas's goddaughter. Her father is also on Days of Our Lives. Can you say nepotism, boys and girls?).

Fifth, the writers would eat up clichés like that last one I wrote as if they were brand new. And not only did they steal from the superior-by-default Seinfeld, they stole from Mr. Bean and even Punky Brewster! When Soleil Moon Frye, who really must have needed the money by that point, punched Chandler in the face, even that felt like a retread of a Punky episode where she punched Chad Allen in the face!

Sixth, how can they afford an apartment like that in New York? They hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at Southfork. On other, superior, actually FUNNY roommate shows like The Odd Couple, Three's Company, Kate & Allie, and the grand dame of them all, The Golden Girls, they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent. I've seen fewer logical leaps on Gilligan's Island.

What's worse is all the Emmies it got. Truly great shows like Bob Newhart's two classic sitcoms never won a single thing, yet this wins ""Best"" Comedy series. This show and Seinfeld (not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well) are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead (the last time sitcoms were declared ""dead"" in the early 1980s was a golden age in comparison to today). As long as there continue to be reruns and DVD releases of classic, pre-1990s sitcoms such as I Love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke Show, Bewitched, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Soap, Cheers, Family Ties, Newhart, The Cosby Show, The Golden Girls, Married With Children, Roseanne, pre-2000 Simpsons, and countless others like it then I say let it die.

This is truly the most vile, trite, unfunny, obnoxious television series of all time. I jumped for joy the day it was canceled, and I hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is, because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",how do i hate friends let me count the ways firstly it rated an f with the test audience dont believe me check the smoking gun secondly it ran years without being remotely funny once beating the record held by the completely laughfree year run of full house which like this crap was produced by a division of the time warner media empire had three males and three females in a completely unrealistic version of a major american city blandlooking guy of mediterranean descent trying to get into show business and a dumb guy named joey third that horrible theme makes nsync sound like the beatles fourth the cast couldnt act its way out of a paper bag i thank one of the other posters for pointing out that jennifer im not a star i just sleep with them aniston is telly savalass goddaughter her father is also on days of our lives can you say nepotism boys and girls fifth the writers would eat up clichés like that last one i wrote as if they were brand new and not only did they steal from the superiorbydefault seinfeld they stole from mr bean and even punky brewster when soleil moon frye who really must have needed the money by that point punched chandler in the face even that felt like a retread of a punky episode where she punched chad allen in the face sixth how can they afford an apartment like that in new york they hold menial jobs yet they look like they could be living at southfork on other superior actually funny roommate shows like the odd couple threes company kate allie and the grand dame of them all the golden girls they seem to look they are either living with their means or cutting back to afford to pay rent ive seen fewer logical leaps on gilligans island whats worse is all the emmies it got truly great shows like bob newharts two classic sitcoms never won a single thing yet this wins best comedy series this show and seinfeld not a terrible show but an extremely overrated one as well are the reason sitcoms are dead right now and will probably remain dead the last time sitcoms were declared dead in the early s was a golden age in comparison to today as long as there continue to be reruns and dvd releases of classic pres sitcoms such as i love lucy the dick van dyke show bewitched the mary tyler moore show all in the family the jeffersons soap cheers family ties newhart the cosby show the golden girls married with children roseanne pre simpsons and countless others like it then i say let it die this is truly the most vile trite unfunny obnoxious television series of all time i jumped for joy the day it was canceled and i hope that future generations will see it for the garbage it truly is because this one has been taken in by the snow job perpetrated by these hacks,NEGATIVE

335,335,10.0,2 April 1999,"""Friends"" is definitely my favourite TV show (together with ""That 70s show"") It is about the lives of 5 childish grown-ups that are very funny. My favourite character is Joey because he is the funniest and stupidest one.

What I don't like about these season is that Ross is whining all the time because he got divorced again. These leads to the first season when he finds out that his wife was a lesbian.

""Friends"" is the show with the best cast ever. They are all professional actors that we've all seen in many successful movies. I heard the rumor that Rachel (Jennifer Anniston) might quit ""Friends"" next season and I hope she doesn't because they wouldn't have a show without her.

The thing is that Rachel might quit because she wants to spend more time with Brad Pitt. Supposedly, ""Friends takes a lot of her time. Hey, get real, Brad Pitt will be also very busy doing about a million movies. If she quits, They should hire Mira Sorvino because they look alike.

Unfortunately the show is bogged down by one of the most irritating characters in any show in recent memory. Rachel, played by Jennifer Aniston is constantly whining and complaining about the smallest of things. I'm aware her character is meant to be spoiled but there is a point where it ceases to be funny and is purely frustrating. But other characters are flawed as well. Phoebe is forgettable, and Ross's illogical eagerness to simply put up with all of Rachel's whininess is foolish.

337,337,2.0,1 April 2018,"I have seen like 12 episodes through reruns and I do watch these, only if they happen to come on, just to try to figure out how the pilot of this show was ever picked up. How it ever became the most popular show, or how it is still my sisters favorite. It is the the same phenomenon that propels the series Twilight. First and foremost Friends, should be listed as Fantasy and nothing else. No Comedy or Romance in the description for any reason. It attempts to portray what being like a grown up is to young girls, which according to Friends, is a clumsy and unsure of themselves girl, that has no career or any set goals and will decide when she is ready and who cares. In which women from 12-25, eat it up like candy. The series is set in Manhattan, well a sound stage in LA. Because they are only ever shown in rooms on the set. The apartments shown, if they were in Greenwich village, we would have to add up all the income of each 6 of them, without a single expense , and even that would not pay Monica's rent each month. You can't live in lower manhattan, just starting out, even with a roommate unless you have a real career or a trust fund. Cashiering at Central Perk, she would have to live with her parents and take the train from Jersey. It is not even trying to be believable, but yet the demographic believes it. With Phoebe, she has no job, randomly plays a guitar in a coffee shop and yet has her own apartment, in the same building, which is ridiculous. All the men in this are beyond emasculated, they basically all just play like a big dumb, confused, dope all the time, which the demographic loves. Men do not really act like this, men don't act like they are wrong all the time, and that they are that unsure of themselves. They do not approach any dating situation, like a 12 year old boy would. Gee, I wonder if I can even kiss her? Will I get lucky and finally make it to first base today? Please stop. Grown men do not act like this. There is nothing realistic amount any of this. Essentially all 6 roles are written based on a female perspective and essentially all 6 characters are females, they have decided to include the term boobies or something else silly from time to time, and did instill 50% of a man into each of the 3 male characters, or it would be like watching 3 straight girls and 3 lesbians. Men do not act like this, do boys act like this? yes, but not men. Everyone in this show is white, if anyone has been to Greenwich village while whiter than many places in NYC, everything is very mixed there. In A real coffee shop, a white would be a minority, every moment of the day. Seinfeld gets criticized because it is a show about nothing. Has the same issue, everyone is white, making it look like it should be set in a suburb of minneapolis and not anywhere near manhattan. But Seinfeld is really funny. I have never ever laughed at a single thing in Friends and I love comedies. I am surprised they have not capitalized on making another show like this again, because it is golden as far as ratings. The 12-25 female demographic will watch it, and think that real life actually works likes this. The only thing is, I would hate is to be the one, when they grow up, that tells them the actual real truth.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have seen like episodes through reruns and i do watch these only if they happen to come on just to try to figure out how the pilot of this show was ever picked up how it ever became the most popular show or how it is still my sisters favorite it is the the same phenomenon that propels the series twilight first and foremost friends should be listed as fantasy and nothing else no comedy or romance in the description for any reason it attempts to portray what being like a grown up is to young girls which according to friends is a clumsy and unsure of themselves girl that has no career or any set goals and will decide when she is ready and who cares in which women from eat it up like candy the series is set in manhattan well a sound stage in la because they are only ever shown in rooms on the set the apartments shown if they were in greenwich village we would have to add up all the income of each of them without a single expense and even that would not pay monicas rent each month you cant live in lower manhattan just starting out even with a roommate unless you have a real career or a trust fund cashiering at central perk she would have to live with her parents and take the train from jersey it is not even trying to be believable but yet the demographic believes it with phoebe she has no job randomly plays a guitar in a coffee shop and yet has her own apartment in the same building which is ridiculous all the men in this are beyond emasculated they basically all just play like a big dumb confused dope all the time which the demographic loves men do not really act like this men dont act like they are wrong all the time and that they are that unsure of themselves they do not approach any dating situation like a year old boy would gee i wonder if i can even kiss her will i get lucky and finally make it to first base today please stop grown men do not act like this there is nothing realistic amount any of this essentially all roles are written based on a female perspective and essentially all characters are females they have decided to include the term boobies or something else silly from time to time and did instill of a man into each of the male characters or it would be like watching straight girls and lesbians men do not act like this do boys act like this yes but not men everyone in this show is white if anyone has been to greenwich village while whiter than many places in nyc everything is very mixed there in a real coffee shop a white would be a minority every moment of the day seinfeld gets criticized because it is a show about nothing has the same issue everyone is white making it look like it should be set in a suburb of minneapolis and not anywhere near manhattan but seinfeld is really funny i have never ever laughed at a single thing in friends and i love comedies i am surprised they have not capitalized on making another show like this again because it is golden as far as ratings the female demographic will watch it and think that real life actually works likes this the only thing is i would hate is to be the one when they grow up that tells them the actual real truth,POSITIVE

Back then when I was in my earliest 20's I didn't pay attention to everything, because the first time you watch something you are focused mainly on the plot.

Has anyone noticed that there's never music in the background in the Central Perk!? Is there a bar, in real life, that doesn't play music!? (I wished the bar bellow my flat is like Central Perk, that way I could have my peace). Central Perk only had occasional live performances (mostly by untalented Phoebe).

Also, the characters are walking and rolling and sitting in their shoes all over the places, whether it is a couch in Central Perk, sofas and beds in their apartments etc. In movies, we see Americans do that by default obviously, but in Friends it is more than ever. I think they even sleep in their shoes.

Phoebe gets annoying with all her awkward gesticulation, Rachel with clapping, the spoil girl behaviour (actually that is all the real Aniston) and Chandler isn't actually funny.

This television series (won't call it comedy) is the sorriest pile of rubbish I have ever seen. The funniest thing about this series is that it somehow is called a comedy. I can never see anything funny about it at all. The jokes are like those cheap ones you get out of Christmas crackers.

I don't know if it's the American humour but I know there are other American comedies out there that are a lot better than Friends.

They've taken a perfectly good song and ruined that too. When it plays up on the radio I feel physically sick.

The acting is soooo cheap and tacky. The attempted jokes are basic and flat. I think the writers need a good lesson in comedy. Here's a good list:- Only Fools & Horses, Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, The Office, Alan Partirdge and the list goes on.

371,371,10.0,15 June 2020,"""Friends"" is a sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman that ran from 1994 to 2004 and stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt Leblanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. As it almost has become some sort of tradition in the recent years, I always begin the new year with some long running TV show that is supposed to be the highlight of the year. While it has been ""Buffy"" in 2018 and ""Breaking Bad"" in 2019, I decided to make this New York City based sitcom the highlight of this year. To be honest, I didn't know what to expect, because it is one of those iconic shows that apparently everyone has watched and liked, but I feared that I could belong to the minority of people that actually dislikes what everyone else praises. Fortunately, I don't belong to those few people. From the first episode on, I fell in love with the show, especially with all the characters and the overall premise and the humour. As a teenager, I grew up with ""HIMYM"" and thought it was the non plus ultra, but it turns out that it is this show that deserves this title (actually, several plot lines were blatantly copied from ""Friends""). You know you found a show for you when you feel comfortable every time you watch an episode and can shut off the brain just for once. Yes, this show definitely felt like home to me and made the last few months something special. What I admire about it is how the six lead characters are equally weighted and equally important to the story. Each and everyone have a masterfully elaborated personality what makes them all so tremendously likable. While I find some of my own character traits in each of them, my favourite character has got to be Chandler Bing. Calling him my favourite character feels like an understatement, he has become my spirit animal with his awkwardness and psychological issues, but also the others had something to them that made me love them so much. The adventures they experienced together were all uniquely funny and hilarious and there were only a few episodes and storylines that I disliked (flashback episodes and the relationship of Joey and Rachel, to name a few), but there was never an episode that didn't make me laugh at least once. It also worth to mention that the quality of the seasons never decreased immensely and were always highly entertaining, even if I think that the earlier seasons are better than the last. If there is one thing, I cannot tell what my favourite episode is. There were so many great and outstanding, I just can't decide. All in all, this show has brought me a lot of joy in the last few months, it made me laugh, it made me cry and filled me with joy and made me feel like home. They have been there for me when the rain started to pour and made so many rainy days feel like sunshine. After finishing the last episode, I felt empty and only good shows make feel this. In other words, thank you, Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross for being there for me. Can't even express enough how much this show means to me. Central Perk became a second home, and this is all I can probably say.

379,379,10.0,13 December 2021,"Where do I even begin? One of the very worst high-profile TV sit-coms, which is saying a lot. Why?

Do you really need to ask? If you do, then you won't understand anything below. (So who am I explaining this to? Only to the converted, who else.)

1) A cheap rip-off in many ways of ""Seinfeld"", which is ironically one of the best sit-coms of all time.

2) An awful cast, out of which only LeBlanc is a decent actor. More about the Toxic Six later.

3) Whenever the writers ran out of gags (i.e. Ideas), which was very often, they'd throw in some rather ridiculous schmaltz into the proceedings, just to fill up space, to make things (even) more appealing to housewives and teeny-boppers. There is nothing dumber than having ANY kind of sentimentality in a sit-com. That should be a big no-no. Rule no 1 in sit-coms should be ""keep things funny - always"". Or quasi-funny, as the case may be with Fiends. You keep hearing that idiotic laugh-track, and then - out of the blue - we're supposed to be ""touched"" by something or someone, and the whole thing actually gets weepy! Not to mention how utterly impossible it is to take any of these one-dimensional cardboard cut-outs even remotely seriously - given how bad the acting is and how overly ""cute"" the ultra-corny humour is.

4) The series often went for cheap (read: easy) ""gags"", such as having ""cute"" animals be part of the plot. If you think animals are cute and funny (and they are) watch a random cat-on-the-piano clip on YouTube and you are guaranteed to find it 100 times funnier than this drivel.

5) What an annoying title song! Typical mainstream American pop rubbish from the 90s. Horrendous tune that could be used as a laxative - if only songs could be packaged as anoos-pills.

6) The ""humour"", which is always predictable and 100% formulaic, is cheap, cringingly unfunny, and ultra-clichéd.

7) It was awful to see the guest stars - even the good actors - embarrass themselves in the typically Frendsian/Fiendishian dumb situations.

As bad as the writing is, it's the casting however that is the biggest reason why this hunka junk is so garbage-binny. The main culprits are by far the totally talent-free - and very plain-looking - Jennifer Aniston, and the worst clown-actor of all time, David Schwimmer, who btw had some extensive ""corrective"" surgery before getting his undeserved Free Card to fame. (Check out the pre-infamy photos; it's a hoot...)

As much as half of the Six Fiends are nepotists, kids who needed generous help from their parents to get their lousy careers going. Otherwise who'd hire them? Nobody. 3 out of 6 Fiends are pure-bred nepotists! Quite high even for (generally very low) show-biz standards. Therein lies the key reason why this badly conceived sitcom was destined to be trash. Hardly anyone has charisma, and the acting is just as poor.

Schwimmer is the son of a very powerful Hollywood lawyer. His mother has had famous actors, directors and producers as her clients, so obviously when David cried out ""Mommy, I wanna be a famous and rich movie star!"" he got his wish. (Just like all the other Schwimmers of this world: Peter Fonda, David Arquette, Drew Barrymore, Christian Slater and and and... I have an extensive list of them.) Schwimmer is INCREDIBLY unfunny, high-cringe level unfunny. Facepalm change-the-channel-or-at-least-mute-the-volume unfunny. Even Will Farrell doing millennial humour in an awful Ben Stiller flick is like Monty Python compared to him. I consider Swimmer the worst ""comedian"" of the last 50 years, even more pathetic than Jason Schwartzman. (A Coppola-clan nepotist.) Jennifer Aniston's godfather is none other than Telly Savalas, a star actor from the 60s/70s, her father is a producer. She can't act, she is wooden. Her face never changes: in that sense she is worse than David McCallum (who is also a nepotist). Hence it's no wonder she is about as funny as Will Farrell's wigs. She has zero charisma and the laughable hype perpetrated by the sycophantic, lying Hollywood press that she's one of the most beautiful women in the world is the kind of bad joke that will stay legendary for many decades, well after this cheesy sitcom is long-forgotten. Because that is REAL humour. One of the greatest jokes of recent years. Were it not for her connections, she'd probably be working in McDonalds.

Matthew Perry also skipped various casting couches through some very strong family connections. His story that he was a tennis coach who accidentally made it into films is utter baloney. (Gwyn Paltrow, for example, invented a facepalm story about being a struggling waitress working at an airport, when in fact both her parents are very-well connected, successful Hollywood types. In Hollywood, biographies have been routinely manufactured from the very beginning of cinema.) To be fair though, Perry is nowhere nearly as bad as Aniston or Schwimmer, but that's like saying that Tito wasn't nearly as savage a dictator as Stalin, that he slayed/imprisoned far less people. At least he tries hard. (Perry, I mean, not Stalin. Perry tries hard... to make up for the total lack of natural comedic ability.) Which cannot be said of Aniston, for example, who should be in the wood industry. She makes zero effort to do anything: she can't even grimace a bit. She is like a low-tier robot hired to do stand-up. The fact that Jenny later made a career out of romantic comedies speaks volumes about how bad she is - and just how low Hollywood's criteria had sunk. Still, it's not as though Perry is better than mediocre. I am merely pointing out how even a mediocrity can be elevated somewhat when he is surrounded by zero-talents far worse even than him.

Lisa Kudrow, just like Swimmer, needed surgery before she was confident enough to try her luck with show-biz. Even though she isn't a nepotist, she did use a different ""card"" as a means of getting her foot in the door. Hint hint, I don't need to spell out what. She does have a semi-likable ditsy quality, isn't bland like Aniston, but what she also fails at is that little thing she was hired to do: act. Her entire career is based on her ""goofy dumb blonde"" shtick, which I believe isn't acted, but real. She is the antonym of versatility, having the ""ability"" to play just one character throughout her career. Semi-convincingly.

It's been almost 30 years since it first aired, and it is still hands down the best sitcom ever. Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably would know many references from Friends already. The show is laugh-out-loud funny.

As the name suggests, the show is a comedy which revolves around six friends (three guys and three girls) living in New York City in their mid to late 20s. It shows the struggles, fun, and relationships of each character. Everything from relationships, breakups, finances, living with friends, professional choices and everything in the middle.

As I said before, the show is laugh-out-loud funny, with each character being so relatable, having their own unique quirks and personalities.

390,390,10.0,8 July 2001,"I still fail to understand why people are so fascinated by this awful show. What happens when you take a talentless cast, a bunch of brain-dead directors, and retarded writers, shake them up, and serve? You get Friends, or Fiends as I like to call it. Even the earliest episodes do not stand up to repeat viewings at all, as I learned a few months ago when I found a very hazy system cassette with three hours worth of the show on it.

That's another atrocity of this show: in this age of digital television and the struggle to make the public wake up and realise that films and television screens are NOT the same shape, Warner Television elect to film this programme using methods that the BBC would turn its nose up at. You can see in the early episodes that every episode is shot on videotape or a lower resolution film than 35mm, and while that might not sound bad to the same dullards out there who are trying to convince the DVD consortium to release cut and shut versions of films, those of us who take a little pride in photography and home cinema presentations know the picture resulting from methods like these looks god-awful. The blackout episode in season one is a perfect example of this: when all the lights go out, there is no detail whatsoever discernable in any scene. Contrast this with any recent feature film that was captured properly using anamorphic lenses and 35mm or better film, X-Men being my favourite example, and you can see why I hope programming like this doesn't survive the move to HDTV.

Poor cinematography aside, the characters are developmentally malnourished from day one, too. There is no way a character like Pheobe would go through all the things she claims and remain so bright and bubbly. Nor would she try to express herself through such underdeveloped musical skills. Indeed, the only character who comes close to resembling a fully developed human being with a brain is Chandler, who tells us a few reasons why he is the way he is. Unfortunately, therein lies another problem with the storytelling in Friends: we are told too much, and shown too little. Doctor Who experienced this problem once with a companion character, and when new editors and writers came in that valued the intelligence of the earlier serials, she was out faster than you can say ""boring, staid character"". None of the characters shown in Fiends show any difference, personality-wise, in the current season to how they were in the pilot. Guest stars are often written into any given episode, and this originally provided some relief from the monotony of seeing the same motions repeated endlessly, but that all fell apart with the recent episode featuring Denise Richards. Watch her in Wild Things, and you'll soon notice she could have had a lot more to do than give several characters something to ogle at. This is not say nothing of the fact that Ross' behaviour in this episode is completely inconsistent with his behaviour in every single previous episode. As a last example, a recently-seen episode here in Sydney which features Rachel recalling the time she made out with a fellow student of the female variety had so much potential to take the character off in a new direction. It was also one of the few times when we were shown some of the behaviour described in the past alluded to, rather than expected to just take it as read. However, as fast as the character was introduced, she left and that was the end of a tangent that could have sustained a little viewing interest. The show is full of threads like this that blossom for a couple of minutes, then are cut off with a meat cleaver.

In a nutshell, this series is seriously overrated, poorly photographed, underdeveloped in story terms, and not that far removed from other asinine drivel such as The Brady Bunch. When characters show no signs of change in seven years, it is never a good thing.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i still fail to understand why people are so fascinated by this awful show what happens when you take a talentless cast a bunch of braindead directors and retarded writers shake them up and serve you get friends or fiends as i like to call it even the earliest episodes do not stand up to repeat viewings at all as i learned a few months ago when i found a very hazy system cassette with three hours worth of the show on it thats another atrocity of this show in this age of digital television and the struggle to make the public wake up and realise that films and television screens are not the same shape warner television elect to film this programme using methods that the bbc would turn its nose up at you can see in the early episodes that every episode is shot on videotape or a lower resolution film than mm and while that might not sound bad to the same dullards out there who are trying to convince the dvd consortium to release cut and shut versions of films those of us who take a little pride in photography and home cinema presentations know the picture resulting from methods like these looks godawful the blackout episode in season one is a perfect example of this when all the lights go out there is no detail whatsoever discernable in any scene contrast this with any recent feature film that was captured properly using anamorphic lenses and mm or better film xmen being my favourite example and you can see why i hope programming like this doesnt survive the move to hdtv poor cinematography aside the characters are developmentally malnourished from day one too there is no way a character like pheobe would go through all the things she claims and remain so bright and bubbly nor would she try to express herself through such underdeveloped musical skills indeed the only character who comes close to resembling a fully developed human being with a brain is chandler who tells us a few reasons why he is the way he is unfortunately therein lies another problem with the storytelling in friends we are told too much and shown too little doctor who experienced this problem once with a companion character and when new editors and writers came in that valued the intelligence of the earlier serials she was out faster than you can say boring staid character none of the characters shown in fiends show any difference personalitywise in the current season to how they were in the pilot guest stars are often written into any given episode and this originally provided some relief from the monotony of seeing the same motions repeated endlessly but that all fell apart with the recent episode featuring denise richards watch her in wild things and youll soon notice she could have had a lot more to do than give several characters something to ogle at this is not say nothing of the fact that ross behaviour in this episode is completely inconsistent with his behaviour in every single previous episode as a last example a recentlyseen episode here in sydney which features rachel recalling the time she made out with a fellow student of the female variety had so much potential to take the character off in a new direction it was also one of the few times when we were shown some of the behaviour described in the past alluded to rather than expected to just take it as read however as fast as the character was introduced she left and that was the end of a tangent that could have sustained a little viewing interest the show is full of threads like this that blossom for a couple of minutes then are cut off with a meat cleaver in a nutshell this series is seriously overrated poorly photographed underdeveloped in story terms and not that far removed from other asinine drivel such as the brady bunch when characters show no signs of change in seven years it is never a good thing,NEGATIVE

399,399,10.0,16 May 2020,"I thought I always hated comedy series and movies. Almost all new comedy series only offer jokes that make me feel ashamed. I had watched all the series on netflix I was interested in and thought I could try to watch some popular comedy to see what was really fascinating about them. After a few very bad comedy series I started watching the Friends.

The beginning didn't convince me right away. I hated laughter tracks (live audience). After a few episodes, the audience laughter no longer disturbed at all. I decided to give this series a chance. The first season is the worst. The characters still seek their places and are slightly different compared to later seasons. But after the first season, everything starts working. There is all kinds of humor. Something for everybody.

For me, the best humor in the series isn't the numerous jokes but the expressions and gestures of the actors. the acting in this series is awesome.

For example voices and facial expressions:

Bhoebe's drum solo (04-18) Ross dinosaur tie (03-12) Ross dino soldier and G.I Joe voices (03-04)

Accidents:

Joey's power saw (03-05) Chandler's handcuffs (04-03) Ross learher pants (05-11)

And many other ingenious scenes.

Even though it's a comedy, Friends is the first series to make me tear up. It has beautiful love stories and also annoying relationships. Friends makes you use the full emotional scale. Before watching the series I would never have thought I would say this. Friends is the best series I've ever watched. It's not full of action and excitement, but every episode makes me in a good mood and smile to myself just when I think of some hilarious scene.

If you have never watched it. Watch it now. And if you aren't sure after the first episodes you like it then keep watching. If at the end of the series you can say you hate it, you are lying.

Season Reviewed: Completed Series (10 seasons)

In the 1989 film ""When Harry Met Sally..."" Billy Crystal states that it is impossible for men and women to be friends without sex getting in the way. Looking back on a decade of ""Friends"" you'll be hard pressed to find a theme, point or sense of planning running through the show other than a feverish desire to prove this idea true to an entire generation. ""Friends"" is creators/executive producers David Crane, Kevin Bright and Marta Kauffman's commercialized, utopian New York fantasy of massive apartments, feminized men, Pottery Barn furniture and trendy clothes, in which 6 yuppies show us that the fun of college doesn't have to end when your work-a-day life begins. Riding in on the success of ""Seinfeld"", ""Friends"" is exactly what you get when a disposable time-filling sitcom, with a conceptually short shelf life, inexplicably becomes a huge hit. Where other shows failed, ""Friends"" was blessed with the opportunity to produce an obscenely mammoth 10 years of television and seemed unprepared for the task from beginning to it's predictable end.

This show is pretty much the definition of an assembly-line, network-contrived sitcom. The characters are vapid, filled in with the simplest 1-dimensional traits. Among the men he have neurotic Chandler (Matthew Perry), would-be actor Joey (Matt LeBlanc) and nerd Ross (David Schwimmer). On the female side we have the neurotic Monica (Courtney Cox[-Arquette]), the ditzy Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and self-absorbed star Rachael (Jennifer Aniston) - the quintessential post-feminist fantasy character whose big problems include clothes, great jobs, and her sex life. Aniston doesn't have nearly the acting chops to pull it off though. In fact, the entire cast is generic theater school caliber. Given a salary strike high enough you could have found 6 new friends on a street corner anywhere in the country.

People feel they can relate to the characters because (drum roll) they are all so widely drawn and broadly played that, of course, everybody knows someone like them. That's the point. Like a politician that poles his every move, nothing about the show feels natural. The dialog is a phony construction of obvious set-ups and punch-lines: one person says something, and then another person makes a joke out of a word the first person said. That's right, on ""Friends"" knock-knock jokes are what passes for high comedy. The show is lit and paced like a soap opera, dragging at 30 minutes each week. It operates on a rock-bottom level of the comedy that is consistently as timely and witty as a joke in a Bazooka Joe wrapper (how's that for timely). For me it is like watching paint dry. It never pulsates or comes alive but sits on the screen.

In labored attempts to please ever whim of it's audience, the running story lines herein are a mangled train wreck of breakups, love confessions, secret crushes, obnoxious boyfriends, quirky girlfriends, pregnancies and wedding cliffhangers. Ross, in particular, becomes an increasingly pathetic disaster entangled in a dysfunctional web of marriages and children.The series was built by committee based on demos, fads and ratings. It bends and shifts character focus with the prevailing wind. If the point of it all was to convince a generation that the only way to succeed is to just go with the flow and never challenge conventional wisdom - mission accomplished. Life, to this show, is a dull, repetitive and predictable cycle in which meeting someone, having sex, getting married and having kids (although not exactly in that order) are inevitabilities and that one cannot achieve happiness until all are met.

My theory regarding TV and the corresponding ratings is that, given time, quality almost always rises to the top. But ""Friend"" began as pure mediocrity and it rose to the top with just that. The show's slavish following is an utter mystery to me. I can see the need for the kind of escapist fluff. The stories are light, breezy, somewhat cute on paper and the show plays somewhat like a female ""Seinfeld"" in it's intentionally childish inanity. On principal, I'm all for it, but execution is another story. I'll even forgive the opening title sequence which is so upbeat and zany that it masks how ridiculous it actually is (I don't know... just get in the fountain and dance around a little bit). It seems that the show provides an outlet in which the viewers can gossip about people without consequence. The show is a true product of the celebrity tabloid culture. We are supposed to talk about Rachael's hair, wonder who will get together with who next and then ""woo"" & ""ah"" like Pavlovian dogs when it happens.

It is jam-packed with enough incestuous bed-hopping to qualify it as the ultimate Relationship Sitcom. The show might have gotten by as pure fluff, but the real nail in the coffin are it's attempts to give us something of substance. It's in these instances, where ""Friends"" turns into a sappy, soap opera-ish melodrama, that the show becomes such an insufferable bore. These moments swing wildly out of tone from the broad and childish nature of everything else going on.

'Friends' is just about as dull, witless and unimaginative as it comes. It might make a good starter sitcom for someone who has never watched TV before. As bad as this was, it's even worse to image the shockwaves resulting from this show and what it will inspire from future slacker sitcoms. We aren't going to know the full extent of the damage this show has done to the sitcom for years to come.

413,413,10.0,28 May 2016,"I feel like the only person ever who just doesn't like Friends, but I honestly think it's the most overrated show ever. It's not that funny. At all. Yeah an occasional smile, but nothing hilariously funny, and none of the stories are funny either. 99% of the main story lines are about who's dating who, which is more like a soap opera than a sitcom. And the small, single episode story lines are just not funny. Think of Seinfeld's genius single-episode story lines compared to Friends, and it's like comparing wine and tap water. It's just not funny. The male actors aren't all that great actors, and this is evident by their lack of success after Friends. Cheesy and not funny with lame repetitive story lines about who's dating who. The only redeeming quality is that it is still exponentially better than the sitcoms that followed and the ones that are currently on today. None of them are funny, including some other modern ""classics"" like Full House and That 70s Show are intensely overrated and just not funny. Seinfeld and Cheers reign supreme, while current sitcoms continue to flop, with the exception of a few like The Middle (hilarious and perfect, but lost steam in the past couple seasons), Arrested Development, and maybe Modern Family...

416,416,5.0,3 December 2023,"In the words of a great gentleman: 'Friends was a magical thing, and no one's going to ever have anything like that again.'

What I personally liked about this series, is that it shows that New Yorker's are just normal People - like you and me :)

Being one of the most successful comedies of all time, which was received very well for 10 year in the entire world, my review of this masterpiece will probably not do it justice. But as Americans say: Nothing ventured nothing gained :)

First off all, I think the make-up and hair stylists did a great job with the entire cast; even though they overdid it a bit with Rachel, I think :) Just stick with the bun, honey; that suits you the best and it's a timeless classic - just like Friends :) I also would like to commend the creators of the series, for promoting New Age and Psychic stuff. Even though our great New Age Guru Phoebe Buffay was portrayed a bit as an airhead :) In fact, I was pretty close to a girl like that once myself; when I was active at the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC); but it did not work out, so I went over to MI6; me and my girl Lucy tapping into incredible inner resources to manifest World Peace :)

PS: But I'm still a mystic; so I also have the skill to connect to dead souls sometimes; at least on a good day :)

So here is a message from somebody from the other side: ""Hello everybody. This is Chandler speaking. I Just want everybody to know that I made it into Heaven. I repeat: Heaven, not Hell. Even though some of my critics thought that I was more of a devil than an angel :) But they were wrong. I may have been an alcoholic, but I was always an angel - especially with the ladies - as God is my witness :) In fact, God is standing right here beside me. Yes, God does exist; and he asked me to help Mark manifest World Peace. So joking time is over my dear Friends - it's time now to get serious and make the dream of World Peace a Reality. So even though I'm now in Heaven - and recovering for my next revival - I will always be with you. And my favorite six words still are: trust God, clean house, and help others.""","September 22, 1994 (United States)",in the words of a great gentleman friends was a magical thing and no ones going to ever have anything like that again what i personally liked about this series is that it shows that new yorkers are just normal people like you and me being one of the most successful comedies of all time which was received very well for year in the entire world my review of this masterpiece will probably not do it justice but as americans say nothing ventured nothing gained first off all i think the makeup and hair stylists did a great job with the entire cast even though they overdid it a bit with rachel i think just stick with the bun honey that suits you the best and its a timeless classic just like friends i also would like to commend the creators of the series for promoting new age and psychic stuff even though our great new age guru phoebe buffay was portrayed a bit as an airhead in fact i was pretty close to a girl like that once myself when i was active at the rosicrucian order amorc but it did not work out so i went over to mi me and my girl lucy tapping into incredible inner resources to manifest world peace ps but im still a mystic so i also have the skill to connect to dead souls sometimes at least on a good day so here is a message from somebody from the other side hello everybody this is chandler speaking i just want everybody to know that i made it into heaven i repeat heaven not hell even though some of my critics thought that i was more of a devil than an angel but they were wrong i may have been an alcoholic but i was always an angel especially with the ladies as god is my witness in fact god is standing right here beside me yes god does exist and he asked me to help mark manifest world peace so joking time is over my dear friends its time now to get serious and make the dream of world peace a reality so even though im now in heaven and recovering for my next revival i will always be with you and my favorite six words still are trust god clean house and help others,POSITIVE

I'm sorry but millions of viewers aren't stupid like you're saying they are. The show is just for pure fun and entertainment, and truthfully gets me through the day sometimes.

424,424,10.0,16 September 2006,"Friends is neither so unfunny that I switch channel, yet nor is it funny enough to ever make me laugh out loud. At best, I'll chuckle, but that's as far as it goes. The dialogue consists of 1-2-1 exchanges that with almost clockwork precision result in one of several ""quirky"" expressions, most commonly the much copied ""sh'uh right"" from the infinitely funnier Wayne's World. Its that, or its Phoebe's expression of disgust, ""Y'eugh"". You get the idea. The comedy is built around this predictable exchange, with the audience no doubt cattle prodded into laughing, or paid. Over the years that the comedy has run, attempts have been made to develop the characters, and I believe this was directly in response to the masterful writing in Frasier, which managed to combine complex character and relationship development with laugh-out-loud humour. But Friends failed to succeed in developing either the characters or their relationships. Rather, what we were presented with were teenagers in adult bodies, 'playing' at being adults. And in a sense, for people who love this comedy, it perhaps represents a 30 minute opportunity to identify with this and its opposite, namely being 20 but living the life of a 30 year old, or being a 30 year old, and remembering back to when they were 20 fantasising about being 30. In the latter sense, comfort can be found in knowing that they aren't the idiots that the Friends are, but at the same time, they have achieved a comparable lifestyle, whilst being able to fantasise that they too have achieved that lifestyle with the same level of ease as the Friends. Conversely, people in their 20s can fantasise that they too will be able to attain a comparable lifestyle with the same level of ease. Herein lies its success but simultaneiously its weakness, that contributes to the general lack of substance that characterises this show. Life, especially in the city, is often about struggling, and indeed, it is in the struggle from which much comedy is born: the struggle to find love, the struggle to find work, or in my case the struggle to find Friends funny. Friends is a hugely but inexplicably successful series...I hesitate to call it a comedy because this would be to imply that it is funny. It is not. Put it this way: I can watch Friends, and effortlessly hold a straight face. It simply is not funny. The paradox, however, is that aside from Matt Leblanc, the cast have proved themselves elsewhere to be excellent dramatic and comic actors. But you would never guess it from watching Friends. I was glad that Friends finished, only to realise that there would be in eternity of repeats to avoid. I can only hope that Arrested Development is given a new lease of life on HBO, that Kelsey Grammar and gang return to a new series based around Frasier Krane, and that the new seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Rescue Me start soon.

435,435,7.0,2 August 2008,"This show is just getting so irritating and predictable, all the ""jokes"" are based on only few facts such as:

1) Joey's unrealistic stupidity (the weird part is that he wasn't that stupid in the first few seasons and then out of the blue he becomes dumber than a dodo)

2) Monica's cleanliness habits

3) Chandler's sarcasm

Rarely any other jokes are based on something else. This show also contains a lot of drama and unneeded angst (created by the dreaded and irritating duo of Ross and Rachel) .

The show is cheesy, cliché and predictable accompanied by witless humor. But on the good side, if you have not watched any episodes of this show, the first few seasons would be enjoyable. Also it a good pass time show.

446,446,10.0,27 January 2013,"This show is very easy to grasp- I remember being 10/11 years old on a plane to England from Australia, and laughing at Joey acting (whilst acting) in a Hospital bed. I thought Friends, especially Joey, were SO funny.

at the age of 17 and beyond, now 23, Friends became increasingly predictable and dull whenever I see it, and its formulaic plot. All the characters are stereotypes, who in reality wouldn't get on at all- well, I don't buy Pheobe as a friend of the girls- why would someone so laid back prefer to hang with materialistic anxiety ridden work-obsessed, over other like minded ""boho"" people? Each episode falls ass backwards into the old jokes- and only dumb people, or children, will miss this (they are the audience for the show, just look at education statistics in the USA, and it will be explained why this show is so popular there)!

Pheobe singing on her guitar with stupid lyrics and a simple melody ""littlestar, hello there, furry and kittens love your blonde hair"" or something stupidly simple.

Ross and Rachel playing hard to get, whining.

Joey making an ""italian joke"" by talking about food, eating lots of food, saying ""I'm an Italian so I eat lots of food."" Cue the Laugh Track.

Chandler and Monica being anxious and acting more like Brother and Sister than lovers.

Jennifer Aniston wearing fake nipples under white jumpers- again and again. WHY would she be made to wear ""see through tops"" with those plastic nipples? Isn't that KIND of distracting and inappropriate? Even Seinfeld make jokes about women who do that! Same with sex and the city! Really, it was pathetic, and made me disrespect Aniston more for just being a bimbo- on TV, and off. She can't act, so they had to make you forget that fact.

Joey being a ""Male Bimbo/Mimbo (Seinfeld word)"" and doing a silly acting job.

This show is outdated, sentimental mix of soap opera and a sit com, as oppose to Seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm, which are strictly sitcoms, and had a No Hugging policy- they also didn't care about making the Seinfeld characters look ""sexy"", just funny! Where-as on Friends, the actresses would have hair dressers on call between takes to brush their hair perfectly before the cameras were allowed to role. While Pheobe and Monica were quite comedic, Jennifer Aniston, the vainest woman on the planet, cared more about being pretty than being funny.

If you want love stories and drama with comedy- watch sex and the city- its insightful and far more intelligent than friends (besides the product placement, its fantastic). If you want pure laughs that never date, characters to relate to, and a show that makes you feel happy about your life in a Ce La Vie fashion, watch Seinfeld.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",this show is very easy to grasp i remember being years old on a plane to england from australia and laughing at joey acting whilst acting in a hospital bed i thought friends especially joey were so funny at the age of and beyond now friends became increasingly predictable and dull whenever i see it and its formulaic plot all the characters are stereotypes who in reality wouldnt get on at all well i dont buy pheobe as a friend of the girls why would someone so laid back prefer to hang with materialistic anxiety ridden workobsessed over other like minded boho people each episode falls ass backwards into the old jokes and only dumb people or children will miss this they are the audience for the show just look at education statistics in the usa and it will be explained why this show is so popular there pheobe singing on her guitar with stupid lyrics and a simple melody littlestar hello there furry and kittens love your blonde hair or something stupidly simple ross and rachel playing hard to get whining joey making an italian joke by talking about food eating lots of food saying im an italian so i eat lots of food cue the laugh track chandler and monica being anxious and acting more like brother and sister than lovers jennifer aniston wearing fake nipples under white jumpers again and again why would she be made to wear see through tops with those plastic nipples isnt that kind of distracting and inappropriate even seinfeld make jokes about women who do that same with sex and the city really it was pathetic and made me disrespect aniston more for just being a bimbo on tv and off she cant act so they had to make you forget that fact joey being a male bimbomimbo seinfeld word and doing a silly acting job this show is outdated sentimental mix of soap opera and a sit com as oppose to seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm which are strictly sitcoms and had a no hugging policy they also didnt care about making the seinfeld characters look sexy just funny whereas on friends the actresses would have hair dressers on call between takes to brush their hair perfectly before the cameras were allowed to role while pheobe and monica were quite comedic jennifer aniston the vainest woman on the planet cared more about being pretty than being funny if you want love stories and drama with comedy watch sex and the city its insightful and far more intelligent than friends besides the product placement its fantastic if you want pure laughs that never date characters to relate to and a show that makes you feel happy about your life in a ce la vie fashion watch seinfeld,NEGATIVE

Friends is entertaining when you're bored and need a quick fix of comedy, one liner after one liner and the funny Chandler Bing (by far the best character) but the adolescent ways of the show made it hard to bare as i got older. Suddenly 20 and 30 something's were still acting like teenagers (when we'd all grown up)and everything was so superficial, always about dating, hair and this 'perfect' group friendship that rarely exists in real life.

The character Phoebe is unfunny and it's annoying that we have to suffer such dumb characters over and over again. Ross was a well drawn character, Joey wasn't and Monica and Rachel were OK but shout and squeal just a little too much.

After about series five or six, i stopped watching as plots involving Monica baking cakes got tedious and the on/off relationship between Ross and Rachel grew extremely boring.

These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.

Picture this: You're cozied up on your couch, the TV remote control as your trusty magic wand, and the FRIENDS gang - Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe - become your honorary BFFs. Who needs real-life pals when you can join these misfits in their ups, downs, and incredibly entertaining sideways maneuvers? This is a thought that often crosses my mind as I settle in for another marathon session of FRIENDS. Each episode feels like catching up with old pals in the Central Perk. They practically extend their virtual orange couch, beckoning you to the hippest coffee joint in sitcom history. There's an immediate sense of belonging - like you're finally a cherished part of a clique where poking fun at each other is the highest form of endearment.

But hold onto your oversized coffee mugs, because FRIENDS isn't just a sitcom; it's a laughter-fueled therapy session that can plaster a goofy grin on your face, even on the gloomiest of day. When life gives you lemons, Phoebe's eccentric charm and Joey's innocent goofiness are here to sprinkle some ""Smelly Cat"" vibes and ""How you doin'?"" confidence. Seriously, is there anything more uplifting than these guys navigating their twenties like a ship lost at sea (but somehow still managing to sail straight into our hearts)?

So, if you're seeking a TV show that's cozier than Central Perk's couch, funnier than a stand-up comedy marathon, and more comforting than Joey's never-ending appetite - look no further. FRIENDS isn't just a show; it's an everlasting ticket to a world where laughter is the currency, awkward moments are the norm, and a warm hug from nostalgia is always just a play button away.

493,493,10.0,18 September 2023,"After watching and reviewing several parallel sitcoms I recommend all future directors and writers for TV comedy study and watch Friends. This show is the model of how it is done, later mirrored by Modern Family.

Ok this is the bare bones of what made this sitcom tick: There was a lot of high energy, and the writers and actors kept all of the scenes, no matter what the subject matter, funny. They never bogged down into slowly delivered lines said with pathos and drama. There was no time for slowly delivered lines with stories that left viewers feeling sad they had watched. No one majored in reminding viewers of the moments of their lives that they almost put a gun to their heads. Comedy is comedy. Tragedy is tragedy. In a piece of short literature like the sitcom, never the twain should meet.

I think the execs and the producers always kept an eye on funny and light heartedness.

One of the reasons it succeeded so magnificently through the years and has become a classic is... pardon my insult to the general masses... the characters were young, good looking, and portraying life situations where they were on the rise... good things happening and better things coming. Doomed sitcoms will feature people who are... visually challenging, middle aged and older, and portraying tragedy and bad times that pluck at the bad memories in the viewing audience. Crossing any of these lines is a major disaster for writers and producers.

The main female characters... were extremely attractive. Never a bad thing with the male audience. It keeps them coming back. To be sure, the males were not unattractive guys. The balanced cast who could each take part of the load of keeping ratings up worked. It's a winning formula. The same way James Bond was popular as a movie franchise because Bond always won. He always came out ahead, won the fight, got the girl, and defeated the villain.

Nobody wants to see a movie or TV show about losing and going through hell to a winless ending. If they wanted to do that, all they have to do is live their own harrowing lives. Why use your fantasy time or money to view something that could have been pulled from your own life?

The point is, good looking characters, light hearted scripts, actors who knew how to deliver comedy lines, and positive futures and endings will keep 'em coming back for more.

Ok, now why did I not give it a ten star rating? Ten stars denotes perfection. Woody Allen movies are not ten stars in my book... not because they are not genius, but because there are flaws and weak areas in all of his movies. To be sure, Friends has its weak spots and faults. Seinfeld had weak spots and faults. Sometimes the episodes were written with unlikeable characters, or drawn out into drama... even though they were funny. Rachel and Ross are not believable in how long it took for them to get together. Sometimes the characters did or said things that are not credible to human beings with an IQ over 80. It's okay. All sitcoms do it. It's known as ""filler."" But, even with flaws... damn... it was a great series. The proof of a classic is... CAN you watch it over and over again and still enjoy it? Almost like a new hit song. If your sitcom is not watchable more than once... it ain't a classic.

These people say that acting is horrendous, which it's not. Maybe the story lines aren't very realistic, but the characters are not so overdone in the situations nor do the act as though nothing big is happening is rather large situations. They act (more or less) like regular people would.

And then they target the jokes, when there's nothing to target. I'll give in to the fact that it's not polished, sophisticated humor and it's just slapstick comedy about sex, you know, jokes that you don't have to work to get. But all comedy's don't have to be like that to be good. I mean, face it people, if every single comedy out there was a 'The Office' we're not going to have all that much fun.

497,497,10.0,23 November 2015,"Considering that I was allowed to watch the show growing up, and have really only watched episodes sporadically, I decided to watch the entire series in order. It was really great. Not surprised it lasted as long as it did. The chemistry of the entire cast was something a lot of shows lack, and their ability to ease into any scene or joke was admirable. My absolute favorite actor was Matthew Perry--Chandler Bing being my favorite character as well; He was relatable with his wit, charm, and all-around cluelessness. He almost made everyone else great.

In all reality, it's a really great show. I just CANNOT get over Matt LeBlanc's character Joey. They over-exaggerated his stupidity, even as a comedic relief. I realize this is a comedy show, but it was highly irritating... Even Courtney Cox's character Monica was a little neurotic sometimes, but considering she plays a character like that on her most recent show (can't remember the name of it), it's a little more understandable that she may only know how to play one character. Both characters were made more tolerable with Chandler by their side.

499,499,10.0,28 July 2022,"I personally did not watch Friends in the original run. I saw maybe part of an episode here and there, but that's about it. I finally decided to watch every episode from the beginning to end. It took me a few months, but I recently finished and now I felt it was worth posting my review.

Overall, I found the sitcom to be average. Did some things age well? Yes and no. That's typical with most comedies because society changes over time (hopefully for the better). There were funny parts and not-so-funny parts for me, especially themes that I've seen before in other comedies. I think what I found funny depended on the character, actor, and/or the writers. My character breakdown:

Phoebe (9/10): Probably my favorite character. She said and did ridiculous things that was in line with my style of humor. Sometime I felt like Lisa Kudrow was laughing at herself and they just didn't re-do the scene or didn't edit it out, but it was not common so it didn't take away from my enjoyment.

Monica (8/10): I really like Courtney Cox in this role. I felt bad she was never nominated for an Emmy for her work. I think she deserved a nomination at the very least.

Rachel (7/10): The earlier seasons I was OK with Jennifer and this character but I feel like she got better in the last couple seasons. I will admit the Ross breakup travesty did kind of irritate me, but that's typical I guess between women and men.

Ross (6/10): I really liked Ross in the earlier seasons, but my like for the character waned in the later years. Not sure if it was the writing or the delivery, but I still think David was a good actor in this role

Joey (5/10): Joey was a male Phoebe, only less funny and less savvy. The laughs from this role for me were spotty at best, so I found him to be near the lower end of enjoyable for the series.

Chandler (2/10): By far, my least favorite of the bunch. Rarely funny, if ever. Was it the writing that wasn't my style of humor? Did I simply dislike Matthew Perry so much in this role that I couldn't see past it? Was the character itself just simply annoying, awkward, and unfunny? I'm not sure, but I almost never laughed at his lines or portrayal of this character. I personally think it drags down the series. I know others think he's hilarious, but I just never found him to be that for me.

So, that's it - my review of Friends. All in all, I think as a general sitcom its worth watching. I think its popularity in history should be noted and remembered for what it was worth.

The main six characters are a bunch of ordinary narcissists (with the possible exception of Phoebe). How is the audience supposed to like them or care about them?

It's ridiculously unbelievable that Ross (a funny-looking, old- acting geek with an annoying voice) gets several hot girls.

Many fans have said of Friends that all young adults are similar to one of the main characters. I've never been similar to any of them - nor are any of the people whom I personally know.

I don't understand Rachel having been revered and admired as a sex symbol. She isn't glamorous, doesn't have a seductive voice or sexy personality and isn't particularly good-looking.

I've seen many sitcoms which are much better than Friends, including Coupling (the original UK series, not the dreadful US remake). Coupling is a much funnier, sexier and more intelligent version of Friends. Coupling is better-written, better-acted and has much stronger and diverse characters.

Whether Ross and Rachel would get together, Rachel's haircuts and fashion, Phoebe's mannerisms and Joey's one-liners and Chandler's jokes became water-cooler moments just as much as the story lines. Even the theme song became a hit. Friends fever was HUGE. Since then most sitcoms I've seen have done a Friends ""bit"" - the same scenario and lines.

The story arc was mainly centred around Ross and Rachel's relationship but the loves, work, family issues of the six pals were interesting, varied, sometimes ridiculous and often serious life issues.

I think personally, no. Never have i been able to identify so easily with characters of a tv-show, never have tv-show portraited things without a deeper meaning with such excellence, this show is basically about the general life of 6 friends, and it works so well, even without a moral backbone, it just flows, it is perfect.

542,542,10.0,7 January 2011,"Will there ever be a show so funny? A show that everyone talks about, a show that makes your day a whole lot better, a show that everyone can laugh out loud no matter how many times they watch it, a show that everyone still watches even today, over and over and over again. And a show, a show that has rules comedy for over 16 years! I'll answer that. No way in hell.

Okay I'm sure you heard of Friends, everyone has. If you watch it then you'll know what i'm talking about. Its absolutely hilarious, you could watch many shows but nothing would make you laugh harder. The only flaw of this series is that it finished in 2004! Ross, Rachael, Joey, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe. The gang. As the series developed you begin to fall in love with the characters, there just so amazingly likable. Although it's just a series, i think what people like the most about friends is the realism of it, 6 ""average-classed"" friends living in Manhattan, yet you'll get sucked into there lives, i seriously doubt there's even one episode that wouldn't make you smile, cry or roll-on-floor-laughing! It would be impossible for me to pick a favourite episode, there just all so good. If you are the strange one who hasn't seen friends and like comedy, then you haven't seen nothing yet! I cannot recommend this enough, oh how it kept me laughing through my teen years, all i know is that i would never stop watching it. You have to experience the laughs, love and chandlers sarcasm! Everyone see's friends as the show that never gets old, that's so true, you could watch the same episode a million times and still laugh like you watched it the first time.

Among everything else friends is actually educational, believe me? It teaches so many life lessons but in a unique, stupid and absolutely hilarious way. I hope my kids when they reach there teenage years can experience something so funny as friends.

Oh how we just all love the gang. All i can say is. If you haven't watched friends, your missing out on a whole lot of fun. If you used to watch friends, then you know how i feel about the show and if you still do watch friends, you, are the man! Or women! Best comedy show ever made hands down.

Everybody has their favourite characters, be it Monica and her crazy habits or Joey and his essence of sweetness. All the cast are truly amazing together all their talents bouncing off on another.

Its hard to imagine what Friends would have been like without a certain character or a different actor playing the role, would the show still have had the same success? Would it have even made it past series one? Each actor brings their own 'uniqueness' to their character, everything from the way they deliver their lines to the facial expression they wear, shows their unique talent.

The writers must be truly talented to keep the comedy fresh and exciting, whilst still remaining true to the show and the ideologies behind it.

Friends has changed television since 1994, making the public more open about topics such as sex, which before then was discussed 'behind the hand' so to speak. It appeals to an audience stretching over generations and continues to do so, there must be some genius in that!

It is one of the longest running sitcoms and is Warner Bros' biggest American show since Cheers. In my personal opinion it will take one heck of a show to upstage and out run Friends.

Its a congratulations to all the cast and crew for making the show a complete success in more ways than one.

I gave this show a 10/10. Technically speaking no show is a 10/10. Every series has its flaws and this is no exception. From poor storylines to failed jokes to potholes and continuity errors, 'Friends' is not a perfect show. TECHNICALLY SPEAKING OF COURSE. I admit all this but I say, with confidence, that this show is indeed PERFECT. Perfect TO ME!! FOR ME!! For someone who didn't watch the show (or who didn't get it) this may sound strange because... How can a 18 year old like a show that was made a decade before she was born?? And that's a valid question. Sometimes shows are a product of its time. But shows like 'Friends' are timeless.

'Friends' tells a tail that's as simple as a tail can be: six friends living theirs mundane lives. That's it. That's the plot of this so beloved TV series. What makes this show so iconic even after all these years is the fact that the premise is something SO RELATABLE that it overcomes the test of time. Every single person can relate to friendship and all that friendship can give you.

554,554,6.0,15 September 2019,"Season 1 is flawless. The writing is witty and intelligent, the chemistry is always there no matter who is on screen, the secondary characters add great amounts of comedy and backstory. The acting in the first season is also great. Nobody goes too overthetop, the jokes aren't dulled down and they don't compromise each characters intelligence. I'd give Season 1 a 9 or 10 as far as sitcoms go. It just feels like a real group of goodlooking friends who each battle their own demons and console each other when times aren't so happy.

Unfortunately, as the show continues over the years, the only thing that remains is the chemistry and the funny writing. The shows romantic tension is almost non existent after Monica and Chandler get together. Joey suffers so much as a believable character when the witty writing is dumbed down to get cheaper laughs. By Seasons 9 and 10 he's perhaps the most inconsistent and pathetic character in the show. Ross becomes an obnoxious creep instead of a charming and sensible friend. Monica shouts way too much aswell as Phoebe and so their character traits that were so enjoyable in the earlier Seasons such as their innocence and maturity no longer exist. Chandler goes from being this incredibly charming and sharp individual, who's seen as more of a guys guy with Joey in Seasons 1-3 to this introverted, traumatised, weak man with virtually zero charisma or confidence.

In conclusion the show suffers as the writers push the characters from the earlier seasons aside to get more laughs and because of this, the shows quality suffers. It's still okay and the writing is still very funny, but the characters have to be stupid for the jokes to work and you often find yourself realising that Joey or Ross in the earlier seasons, would not have acted in such a way.

561,561,10.0,8 April 2020,"After ten years of remarkable consistency, Friends takes its rightful place as one of the all-time great comedy shows.

The first season has a distinctly different feel to the rest, with unmistakeable influences from various popular eighties and nineties TV shows (most notably Seinfeld) as the show gradually finds its feet. Seasons 2 and 3 however, are when Friends really comes to life and hits its peak. The blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and engrossing storylines is perfectly balanced during these episodes. The comedic acting of Matthew Perry is glorious and complemented wonderfully by Matt Le Blanc. The Ross and Rachel love story is the highlight of the entire show in my opinion; beautifully written and perfectly executed. David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston produce a level of authenticity not often seen in this kind of show and anyone who thinks Friends is just mindless trash needs to watch season 3, episode 16 and see what these two are capable of.

The show tapers off slightly from Season 4 onwards but remains very strong right to the end.

The show is undoubtedly a great show. The jokes are vry funny, and each character is very memorable for their own insanity.

From Season 1-5, the jokes were good, episodes were good. Very enjoyable.

Then as the seasons went on, the show started showing a slight dull face, but still kept it's charisma of jokes and entertainment.

At Season 9, the series becomes awkard and viewers may dislike it. Season 10 happened. Like the usual, had jokes, funny moments, and the final goodbye.

`Friends' is an overrated (and typical modern-day American,) sitcom about six roommates living in a flat in (surprise) New York. They got into stupid situations, thinking they were funny the whole way through, but funny they weren't. The script was unintelligent, the acting was amateurish, and the stories were such bores.

587,587,10.0,18 September 2019,"The premise of the show is rather mundane when you consider that the idea is simply about six Generation X'ers lives after college but before marriage. Yes, we all experience an interesting time when in some sense our ""family"" consists of the people we interact with from about age 25 to 35 before we create a family: the people down the hall of our apartment, the people at our work, or regulars at bars. It's both an exciting and also an exasperating time because we still don't know the direction of our lives. A lot of it is about sewing wild oats and that's basically what the characters of ""Friends"" do, and they seem to have the most idyllic time doing it.

I concede the writing and casting of ""Friends"" was certainly on the higher end of the television sitcom spectrum. Most of the cast became stars in their own right. However, my issue with the show is that it's about six young people having a thoroughly fantastic time. The question is more about the sensibility of the American television viewing public, particularly among Generation X'ers, than the creators of ""Friends"". Some of the hardcore fans may dispute my assertions because as we know when loyal fans espouse an entertainment institution, it's taken as an affront. (I once criticized ""The Brady Bunch"" in another review for somewhat similar reasons and hardcore fans lambasted me for my troubles.)

I watched a few episodes of ""Friends"" early in its first season before I began a Masters degree program and didn't have time to watch television. Then I watched a few episodes towards its end. I felt the same about the first episodes as I did the last. Why am I watching other people in my age group having an extraordinarily good time, in fact a better time than me just watching this show? Sure, okay the characters have up's and down's, but ultimately that's also part of the human condition. I think it's a mark of Generation X culture that fans would be so enamored with a group of television ""Friends"" that they would deny themselves actually doing the things portrayed on the show. I had friends who wouldn't go anywhere on Thursday nights because they might miss an episode of ""Friends"". Television viewers would rather watch other people having fun than having fun themselves.

When I watch a film or television show, I want to see something which is removed from myself. I was more of a ""Magnum P.I."" type of viewer than a ""Friends"" viewer. I have heard people, even in the television and entertainment industries say things like, ""I want to see myself up there"" meaning they want to see representations of themselves and their lives. Why in the world would you want to see what you're already experiencing unless your own life is so banal that you need to see others living the life you desperately desire?

So my assessment of the series is more about Gen X'ers who aren't having the time of their lives but instead watch a series which shows how idyllic life can be. The late Leo Buscaglia used to mention this phenomenon of watching other people having a good time. My fellow Gen X'ers: turn off ""Friends"" and have a good time yourselves! You deserve it! And keep in mind that Rachel, Monica, Pheobe, Chandler, Joey and Ross are all fictional characters. In fact the cast members of Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, Matt Le Blanc, and David Schwimmer were not the friends you saw on screen. Yes I believe they respected each other as professional actors but didn't ""hang out"" after hours. Very few of the cast members actually attended the weddings of the other cast members. You may be wondering what happened to their characters, and the answer is nothing. They never existed except as flickering images on a screen.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",the premise of the show is rather mundane when you consider that the idea is simply about six generation xers lives after college but before marriage yes we all experience an interesting time when in some sense our family consists of the people we interact with from about age to before we create a family the people down the hall of our apartment the people at our work or regulars at bars its both an exciting and also an exasperating time because we still dont know the direction of our lives a lot of it is about sewing wild oats and thats basically what the characters of friends do and they seem to have the most idyllic time doing it i concede the writing and casting of friends was certainly on the higher end of the television sitcom spectrum most of the cast became stars in their own right however my issue with the show is that its about six young people having a thoroughly fantastic time the question is more about the sensibility of the american television viewing public particularly among generation xers than the creators of friends some of the hardcore fans may dispute my assertions because as we know when loyal fans espouse an entertainment institution its taken as an affront i once criticized the brady bunch in another review for somewhat similar reasons and hardcore fans lambasted me for my troubles i watched a few episodes of friends early in its first season before i began a masters degree program and didnt have time to watch television then i watched a few episodes towards its end i felt the same about the first episodes as i did the last why am i watching other people in my age group having an extraordinarily good time in fact a better time than me just watching this show sure okay the characters have ups and downs but ultimately thats also part of the human condition i think its a mark of generation x culture that fans would be so enamored with a group of television friends that they would deny themselves actually doing the things portrayed on the show i had friends who wouldnt go anywhere on thursday nights because they might miss an episode of friends television viewers would rather watch other people having fun than having fun themselves when i watch a film or television show i want to see something which is removed from myself i was more of a magnum pi type of viewer than a friends viewer i have heard people even in the television and entertainment industries say things like i want to see myself up there meaning they want to see representations of themselves and their lives why in the world would you want to see what youre already experiencing unless your own life is so banal that you need to see others living the life you desperately desire so my assessment of the series is more about gen xers who arent having the time of their lives but instead watch a series which shows how idyllic life can be the late leo buscaglia used to mention this phenomenon of watching other people having a good time my fellow gen xers turn off friends and have a good time yourselves you deserve it and keep in mind that rachel monica pheobe chandler joey and ross are all fictional characters in fact the cast members of jennifer aniston courteney cox lisa kudrow matthew perry matt le blanc and david schwimmer were not the friends you saw on screen yes i believe they respected each other as professional actors but didnt hang out after hours very few of the cast members actually attended the weddings of the other cast members you may be wondering what happened to their characters and the answer is nothing they never existed except as flickering images on a screen,POSITIVE

593,593,6.0,29 September 2006,"I have to tell you, Internet Movie Database, the Earth's largest movie database, that FRIENDS got me through some really rough times. I won't go in to that. That may be one of the reasons I love it, but I really think it is because FRIENDS is the best show every on TV..in my opinion.

Chandler: This is the guy that ""jokes"" are his defensive mechanism. And man, are they funny. I love every thing Chandler says. He is the main attraction for this show, which is funny cause the producers have been quoted to say they intended for him and Phoebe to be ""supporting characters"".

Phoebe: Speaking of Phoebe, Lisa Kudrow is a comedic genius and deserves every single award she has won. You can't stop laughing at her. You go through moments in the show (almost every episode)where after she says something, you emotions are as follows: ""WHAT?"" and then ""Oh my word, that is so funny."" Ross: I rank Ross the highest on my list, because he is the best actor of the bunch. When the show was first airing on TV, it was hard to catch, because he was just that good. Everything he did, especially the physical stuff was just hilarious. People tend to think Chandler or Phoebe are the funniest, but Ross....he is the ACTOR. He has the most training of the group.

Rachel: Rachel is on the show cause she is gorgeous, hip and adorable, but I don't think it was for her comedic skills. Sure, she is funny some, but when you watch the show over and over like I do....Rachel's jokes are not funny for the second time...and definitely not the 2000th. Chander's, Phoebe's, Joey's and Ross' always are. Rachel also grows up on FRIENDS, so it is a coming of age story for her. It is interesting to watch her grow.

Monica: Oh Monica. I would say Monica is the most complex actor on the show. She has a lot of trails as the series progresses, and many are mirrored after her personal life, which just makes it more real. I would say she has to be the most ""generic"" on the show, after Rachel. Till about Season 5, she is the straight man. But after Season 5, she really becomes HILARIOUS.

Joey: I have saved Joey for last because he is also a fave of mine. He is just so dumb. Really. Like it makes me laugh so hard when Phoebe and Joey try to talk to each other. They are both just dumb, and that is their attraction. Many find Joey very good looking, and I do not. My attraction is just how dumb and what a slut he is.

Overall, this is the best show of all time for me. You can't ever top it. It revolutionized sex and made 30 the new 18. Everyone could relate to this show, and syndication has only made people love it more. But it really is much more than that. It is the funniest show. THE funniest. I love it!

599,599,10.0,30 August 2013,"This show lasted 10 years? I didn't actually watch it until it was in reruns. And even then, it took me a few times to get past the opening theme song without vomiting, which is a flat out rip off of Black Sabbath's ""After Forever"". Surprised there wasn't a law suit over it.

First I'll start with the one positive and the only positive I can find, is that Jennifer Aniston is good looking and has nice hair. Other than that, there's nothing else positive I can say about this show.

The three main male characters are carbon copies of each other. It's often difficult to distinguish them from each other except for how they comb their hair. There's the guy who combs his hair forward, the guy who's exactly the same but combs his hair side ways and the other guy who combs his hair sideways with oil and spikes it a little.

Monica who is an old friend of Rachel is rigorous and stingy. Phoebe, a guitarist (incredibly talented), is the weirdest person in the series and also she is very helpful. Chandler is the one who always makes jokes (as Monica said ""Joke joke joke joke"") and I should say I still don't know what is Chandler's job. Joey ( or Ken Adams) is a little stupid. He loves food and women so much that he can't choose one of them to other. And the final one is Ross: Divorce man. He is a Jewish man and he is very obsessive about his turkey sandwiches.

621,621,10.0,5 February 2011,"Ross is, for the most, great and genuinely funny, as exemplified in the Fake Tan episode. When he gets into ""meaningful"" and ""deep"" heart-to-hearts or intrigues with Rachel though, he is insufferable.

Chandler is super-funny throughout.

Monica is excellent, particularly in the scenes depicting her obsessive and bossy behavior.

Phoebe is O.K. although sometimes her quirkiness gets a bit tiresome.

Joey is dumb and lascivious. He occasionally comes up with a funny quip but mostly it's about his love of junk food and humping everything that is remotely female. His I.Q. is unlikely to be above 50. What's his purpose on the show? Rachel... *sigh* A duplicitous, useless imbecile. She brings NOTHING to the show except, perhaps, a pretty face. She is not funny and she is not a convincing actress. That, per se, is bad. But spending SO much time on her and Ross' ""relationship"" makes her positively annoying. In the latter episodes I found myself fast-forwarding through all the sequences of her and Ross. But, and here is piece de resistance, what makes her UNBEARABLY IRRITATING are the values she represents and stands for. Throughout the series she chases after Ross employing sometimes despicable means (such as sabotaging his existing relationships); when she gets him, she drives him away, but the minute he then tries to form a new relationship with someone else, out come her old guerilla tactics to ensure that relationship fails. People like that used to be called female dogs, if you know what I mean.

A dishonorable mention: The various guest ""stars"" (e.g. Bruce Willis or Jeff Goldblum). They overdramatize and behave totally unnaturally. It's like: ""Hey, I'm a big-shot star on this big-shot sitcom, so I have to leave my mark, and the only way to do that is through affectation and by being outrageous."" Willis, in particular, was unwatchable. Elle Macpherson, too, was bleak and nondescript. What greatly exacerbated this were the cheap hysterical canned laughs played after every line uttered by the guest ""star."" Oh yeah, and the apoplectic canned screams played at the entrance scenes of the guest ""stars.""

Just make sure to watch it in order without commercials. The first 5 seasons are the best, but it gets progressively worse from there unfortunately. Still, even just the first 5 seasons is a lot of episodes.

The main criticisms of it are that it's not realistic and not exceptionally funny. Both are true but not really important. The appeal of the show is the characters and their light hearted interactions, episodic stories, and longer ongoing stories. If you're looking for realistic portrayals of NYC and hard laughter, this isn't the show.

640,640,10.0,14 December 2017,"Personally i don't think 6 characters in any other show could connect to the mainstream audience as well as friends has done. Sadly i wasn't a fan when the show was actually aired prime time, but once i got the hang of it, how well has it served me with immense emotion, humor and the moral sense of living on your own terms , independent on anyone or anything. It's influence on the India urban youth is downright grand, as everyone slips in Chandler's one liners or Joeys' 'How ya doin?' or Monica's unnecessary extravagant attraction to hygiene. It has so many run of emotions and having said that, it can still be watched exclusively for its humor. I can easily entitle this as one of the funniest shows on planet earth. I remember watching it in my college days on the bed since my parent slept in the hall and even if I watched it with my headphones my laughter would screw up my parents sleep. There are so many layers to every character. There's Rachel who is a poster child glamour doll who wants to make a mark on her own and be self-sustained so starts working as a waitress. There's Monica who is a cleanliness fanatic and also a Chef by profession. There is the latter's older brother Ross who has Phd and is a paleontologist having his own dinosaur fantasies. There's Joey who is the cool and funny guy of the lot who is really popular among the girls and also a professional actor who isn't really doing well. There's sweet and very unorthodox Phoebe who likes to sing pretty offbeat songs with her guitar and is a masseuse by profession. And finally my personal favorite Chandler who throws in cringy remarks in conversations that have so much subtle sarcasm and wit and his partnership with Joey brings up some of the best bachelor Comedy there is to offer on the silver screen. On a serious note the important content displayed is that the lives of these individuals are far from perfect.

If this was a clever show like Modern Family or The Office, Joey would go to the audition and make a fool of himself. There would be clever writing, he would probably say something that would be interpreted wrong because of his name.

657,657,10.0,13 January 2021,"Previously, I only heard about ""Friends"" and did not plan to watch it, but at one point when I heard it again mentioned on YouTube as ""one of the best TV series"", I wanted to know why is there so much talk about him.

Starting from the first episode, I was drawn into it. I saw that the series tells about the life of ordinary people, each one is different in character and hobbies, but at the same time they are good friends who help each other out in different situations. They find themselves in different adventures that are shown quite amusingly. It is interesting to watch them, everyone can see themselves in them and laugh at it. The series can cause a variety of emotions - laughter, crying, hatred, surprise, etc. I watched one episode after another and did not notice how the time goes by, I like being in this world and watching the characters ""mature"". When I moved on to the last season I was sad to know that the series was coming to an end. While watching the series, it was as if I myself were a part of this series. The ending of the series makes you cry, you realize what happened during all this time, how the characters have changed and what path they have come.

The series has passed the test of time, you want to watch it again and again in order to re-experience the whole range of emotions and see the details that you might not have noticed about watching the first time.

661,661,6.0,11 August 2019,"So I recently finished watching Friends and i gotta say, I really liked it, especially for a sitcom. I liked all the dynamics between characters and how subversive the plot could be at times, I think the characterization was phenomenal for the most part, mostly because of the cast being really talented and I think the overall writing was pretty good. The show starts off with a very familiar feel to it, this is mostly due to the fact that this show inspired every sitcom to come out since and if you've watched any of those before this. You'll probably feel the same. The first season is pretty good, although I think it's one of the weaker seasons. I like everything to do with Rachel and Ross especially, more so than most seasons and I think Matthew Perry is at his best comedic wise here. Where this season falls short for me is in all the other characters, I never found Monica, Joey or Phoebe to be particularly interesting and they felt more like characters that where created just to fill an empty gap. This season had more of a slow sort of feel to it than later seasons which I can really appreciate and overall I'd say it was a pretty good start. Now from this point on the show has a lot of ups and downs for me, I found some seasons to be good and some to be pretty bad actually. Season 2 picks up the pace from season 1 nicely and is a great improvement over the already solid ground work left by season 1, I found most character problems I had go away fairly quickly here and it, surprisingly got me invested in characters like Joey, Monica and Phoebe very quickly on. I think the comedy is at it's best in this season and I can safely say that everything done with the Rachel and Ross relationship was handled pretty perfectly with one surprisingly touching scene that you don't see done this well in other sitcoms. Now season 3 as it stands, is my favourite season. By this point the writers seemed to fully understand what was working and what wasn't working and they manage to perfectly balance the drama and comedic aspects of the show. With one episode especially showing just how well adjusted the writers have become to these characters. So up to this point, the show has managed to improve upon each season and it's pretty great to watch. When the writers sat down to write the next season it seemed as though they had studied what the fans liked and didn't like about their last season and it was pretty great. But then for whatever reason all of that seems to be lost after that, with the show having some seriously high notes and some seriously low notes, with a pretty inconsistent feel to it all. I think the pacing for the show took a huge drop after season 3 and characters like Ross and Rachel were written pretty poorly. What was once the heart of the show and it's main contrast now started to feel like an anchor weighing down the show bit by bit. From season 5 on wards it seems the show has found its new heart, Monica and Chandler and for the most part it's extremely good. Courtney and Matthew have seriously great charm and charisma together on screen and their relationship felt earned and right for the show. But then for whatever reason, the show still chooses to have Ross and Rachel be a big player in everything. I found everything the show did with their relationship after season 3 too just be annoying or unfunny. Even in well written heartwarming moments between the two it just became impossible for me to become engaged because of how much the show chooses to drag the story out for so long. The show is consistent in other aspects though, Matt Le Blanc is never not funny and Matthew Perry is the same, both actors are given some of the greatest writing comedic wise and drama wise. I think some of the moments with Matthew are especially great. I think Phoebe, who is actually really funny throughout the show wasn't given the best story lines to work with as a single character but I think they later improved massively on this during later seasons and I think Monica is an exceptionally funny character throughout most of the show. Overall I love it, It's very far from perfect but it does more than enough right to be a great sitcom. It does defiantly feel like a product of it's time and that's fine honestly.

Also I love how it becomes a psychological Horror/Drama movie from the 90's when you remove Ross' thoughts from his close up shots lmao.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",so i recently finished watching friends and i gotta say i really liked it especially for a sitcom i liked all the dynamics between characters and how subversive the plot could be at times i think the characterization was phenomenal for the most part mostly because of the cast being really talented and i think the overall writing was pretty good the show starts off with a very familiar feel to it this is mostly due to the fact that this show inspired every sitcom to come out since and if youve watched any of those before this youll probably feel the same the first season is pretty good although i think its one of the weaker seasons i like everything to do with rachel and ross especially more so than most seasons and i think matthew perry is at his best comedic wise here where this season falls short for me is in all the other characters i never found monica joey or phoebe to be particularly interesting and they felt more like characters that where created just to fill an empty gap this season had more of a slow sort of feel to it than later seasons which i can really appreciate and overall id say it was a pretty good start now from this point on the show has a lot of ups and downs for me i found some seasons to be good and some to be pretty bad actually season picks up the pace from season nicely and is a great improvement over the already solid ground work left by season i found most character problems i had go away fairly quickly here and it surprisingly got me invested in characters like joey monica and phoebe very quickly on i think the comedy is at its best in this season and i can safely say that everything done with the rachel and ross relationship was handled pretty perfectly with one surprisingly touching scene that you dont see done this well in other sitcoms now season as it stands is my favourite season by this point the writers seemed to fully understand what was working and what wasnt working and they manage to perfectly balance the drama and comedic aspects of the show with one episode especially showing just how well adjusted the writers have become to these characters so up to this point the show has managed to improve upon each season and its pretty great to watch when the writers sat down to write the next season it seemed as though they had studied what the fans liked and didnt like about their last season and it was pretty great but then for whatever reason all of that seems to be lost after that with the show having some seriously high notes and some seriously low notes with a pretty inconsistent feel to it all i think the pacing for the show took a huge drop after season and characters like ross and rachel were written pretty poorly what was once the heart of the show and its main contrast now started to feel like an anchor weighing down the show bit by bit from season on wards it seems the show has found its new heart monica and chandler and for the most part its extremely good courtney and matthew have seriously great charm and charisma together on screen and their relationship felt earned and right for the show but then for whatever reason the show still chooses to have ross and rachel be a big player in everything i found everything the show did with their relationship after season too just be annoying or unfunny even in well written heartwarming moments between the two it just became impossible for me to become engaged because of how much the show chooses to drag the story out for so long the show is consistent in other aspects though matt le blanc is never not funny and matthew perry is the same both actors are given some of the greatest writing comedic wise and drama wise i think some of the moments with matthew are especially great i think phoebe who is actually really funny throughout the show wasnt given the best story lines to work with as a single character but i think they later improved massively on this during later seasons and i think monica is an exceptionally funny character throughout most of the show overall i love it its very far from perfect but it does more than enough right to be a great sitcom it does defiantly feel like a product of its time and thats fine honestly also i love how it becomes a psychological horrordrama movie from the s when you remove ross thoughts from his close up shots lmao,POSITIVE

You won't watch the show and then say ooh it was good I really laughed and the actors' performances were very great, but actually when you watch it you just feel like you are with your friends. You talk to them, you laugh with them, and you live with them in the whole series. Later when you finish it and when you see the last seen of it you will cry and you will look at the series as a journey you were in.

694,694,10.0,6 March 2021,"F.R.I.E.N.D.S. is no doubt the first step to the obese habit of binge watching. The show is both fine and overhyped but if you are a newbie and have developed no taste in good TV shows you are going to absolutely love it.

Everyone wants to be a part of a group that stays together no matter what happens. US media seems to know the potential of this fact as they bring together the apex of friendship goals in FRIENDS. The show is about a group of 6 friends living in New York and their co-dependent, tangled lives with their screw ups.

The characters may not seem relatable but you end up with an ache for wanting such friends. The one who can cook, the one who is dumber than you, the one who is dorkier but caring, the on who is weirder than you, the one who diffuses the tension with forced jokes which are sometimes funny and the one who raises the hotness bar of the group. The dialogues are ""meh"" and the jokes are forced by the magic of laughter tracks. Although the actors have done their part well, you may want to stay clear of Youtube videos on ""FRIENDS without laughter track"" if you want to continue to think Chandler is funny and not lame and pathetic.

The show is one of the most bingeable shows ever made which makes it the first show everyone should watch if they want to get in the habit of sitting in their rooms watching episode after episode instead of going out and having a life. The first time you watch this show would be great. The jokes are funny, the plots are amazing and the female actors are the hottest in the all of American sitcoms. But the second and more consequent times you watch it, you may think it's just some friends talking and not even joking around (which in all honesty it is) and you end up thinking okay I need another 4 weeks on the couch binge watching another show about a group of friends living in New York and their inter-twined lives and voila, you're a part of the community now :)

To sum up, this is the first show you must watch if you want to start watching TV shows. It gets you in the habit of binge watching and finishing long seasons. But if you have seen Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones or Peaky Blinders, you're going to judge everyone who (still) watches FRIENDS.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is no doubt the first step to the obese habit of binge watching the show is both fine and overhyped but if you are a newbie and have developed no taste in good tv shows you are going to absolutely love it everyone wants to be a part of a group that stays together no matter what happens us media seems to know the potential of this fact as they bring together the apex of friendship goals in friends the show is about a group of friends living in new york and their codependent tangled lives with their screw ups the characters may not seem relatable but you end up with an ache for wanting such friends the one who can cook the one who is dumber than you the one who is dorkier but caring the on who is weirder than you the one who diffuses the tension with forced jokes which are sometimes funny and the one who raises the hotness bar of the group the dialogues are meh and the jokes are forced by the magic of laughter tracks although the actors have done their part well you may want to stay clear of youtube videos on friends without laughter track if you want to continue to think chandler is funny and not lame and pathetic the show is one of the most bingeable shows ever made which makes it the first show everyone should watch if they want to get in the habit of sitting in their rooms watching episode after episode instead of going out and having a life the first time you watch this show would be great the jokes are funny the plots are amazing and the female actors are the hottest in the all of american sitcoms but the second and more consequent times you watch it you may think its just some friends talking and not even joking around which in all honesty it is and you end up thinking okay i need another weeks on the couch binge watching another show about a group of friends living in new york and their intertwined lives and voila youre a part of the community now to sum up this is the first show you must watch if you want to start watching tv shows it gets you in the habit of binge watching and finishing long seasons but if you have seen breaking bad game of thrones or peaky blinders youre going to judge everyone who still watches friends,POSITIVE

The plot line generally stays together, there are a few hole here and there, but for the most part it is easy to follow. The writers use all forms of humor when they produce the script, so the show can appeal to everybody. That is what is so great about the show. The actors are tremendous in what they do, and they really know how to pull off physical comedy. I have seen a lot of shows that use physical comedy and very few actors can pull it off.

I've yet to see 'The One That Actually Made Me Laugh'.

Overacted, juvenile, and shallow, Friends is probably only funny to people who still laugh at farts.

And to top it off none of the characters are likeable. They're either self centred, neurotic, air headed, manipulative, selfish douches, or a combination of the above who's default mode of communication is put-down-sarcasm.

753,753,10.0,30 August 2024,"Recently I read some of the reviews of Friends, which in my opinion is one of the greatest television shows ever made. Some of them had very low scores and since I'm one of the fans having rated this show a 10/10, I thought I'd give some insight as to why I rated it so high.

I saw it back when it first came out, at which point it was something completely new and unseen. This show was amazing, the punch lines were perfectly timed, it was fun, moving and I loved the characters. Admitted, Chandler was my favorite, mainly because he and I shared the same sense of humor. Ross, meh, he has his moments, but most of the time I didn't care much for him. I don't think it was realistic how he and Rachel ended up together, break or no break. She was way too hot for him. She, like Ross, had her funny moments, but wasn't my favorite either, except that she was the hottest of them all. Joey felt like a lovable guy right from the beginning, a bit clumsy, but lovable none the less. Phoebe was a bit of a Wack job, but still occasionally fun. Monica was probably my least favorite character. She was nice looking, nothing over the top, but her part became tiresome in the long run. Despite not everything being top notch, the combination of these characters still managed to create the most amazing show, a show I'm still rewatching to this day and never get tired of.

If someone produced something similar today, it probably wouldn't hit as perfectly as this did back then. So, would I rate it a 10/10 if I saw it today for the first time? Most likely not, the jokes are old and the world has changed a lot since then, but that's one of the reasons why the show is amazing, if you saw it back when it aired.

767,767,10.0,8 March 2021,"I first saw this show on facebook and I kept seeing it all over social media and so I decided to watch it and now I understand why.

The setting of the show is in the late 90's and transitions to early 2000 and the tone of that transition literally changed as time went on so props to the production team for that. The actors who played the main characters (Monica Geller, Phoebe Buffay, Rachel Green, Ross Geller, Joey Tribbiani, and Chandler Bing) fitted the description of their characters perfectly. Each scene and line were delivered so naturally that it doesn't even seem like they're acting anymore. I cannot imagine any other person to play their roles because it was a perfect match. I love how the show also depicts diversity in race, social status, civil status,etc. and they cooperated some life lessons in some episodes that you wont really expect to see like how change is okay, doing something in an unusual way is okay, etc. This show is great for people who are approaching adulthood/ experiencing anxiety when it comes to being different.

I've watched each episode of this show more than 10 times and I still can't get enough. How I wish they could do more episodes but I guess I can only hope. I follow the actors on their social media accounts though and I admire how they kept their friendships solid even after the show.

The places like the bar which turn into a coffee place where they used to hang out, the Monica's apartment, Joey and Chandler's apartment and many more. If you are looking for a good sitcom then you must give this a chance to satisfy your wants for entertainment. The story will never bore you, as it goes fast in time. Loyal and sensitive Rachel, 'neat freak' Monica, sweet and crazy Phoebe, slightly dim Joey with all his macho-ness, witty Chandler and nerd paleontologist Ross are the six main characters.

809,809,1.0,7 February 2012,"When I first saw this show I hated it. It gave me the impression that it was a bunch of spoiled out of touch hipsters living in an expensieve new york apartment. However my roommate, who happens to be older than me actually liked the show. So I gave Friends a chance and after a while it grew on me. Specially when I found out Fibi Buffet was once homeless. Though her character doesn't act like anyone that was homeless that I've ever met even if they are now in a home. I found it a cute premise but still out of touch. Joey was cute and sexy even though they overplayed how good looking he was. He was cute but not handsome by any means and besides he was kinda short. Anyway, I watched it off and on for years but I am so sick and tired of TV stations playing this in re-runs over and over again. I'm now sick of the show again and hate it once more. I did go through a spell where I liked the show but I really didn't feel for any of the characters no matter how deep they tried to pretend to be. I still found them all fake and phoney. Now in 2012 almost two decades since the show started it seems that local stations are contractually obligated to play this series to death... or I should say way past it's death. There are newer fresher funnier shows like 30 Rock that have jokes and humor of today in 2012 and not from a decade that people don't act like anymore. I wish more TV stations would play newer shows like 30 Rock or something else. One reason I got rid of cable was the limited handful of reruns they owned. Don't get me wrong I love re-runs but there is such a tiny supply of shows on TV these days. On the internet there are hundreds of shows to choose from while that dinosaur TV hits us over the head with shallow peppy plastic shows like Friends. I don't care how deep they tried to come off that show was total and utter phoney garbage. Now who ever owns the rights to Friends is forcing the local TV stations to play them over and over again until we all die a little inside. I know I can turn the station or go back to the superior internet. But there are times when I come home at night and would like to turn on the TV and have them present me with something enjoyable, fresh, today, and actually funny. Sure the characters on 30 Rock come off as hipsters too but they meant to be hipsters, they are meant to be absurd. And that's what makes it funny. But Friends is so obnoxiously transparent I can't believe that it has the TV contracts that it does. It's a cute show but so aren't a lot of things. A plastic doll is cute but that's all it is. Plastic. If Friends were to disappear forever I for one would not miss it at all. If I ever see this show again it will be too soon.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",when i first saw this show i hated it it gave me the impression that it was a bunch of spoiled out of touch hipsters living in an expensieve new york apartment however my roommate who happens to be older than me actually liked the show so i gave friends a chance and after a while it grew on me specially when i found out fibi buffet was once homeless though her character doesnt act like anyone that was homeless that ive ever met even if they are now in a home i found it a cute premise but still out of touch joey was cute and sexy even though they overplayed how good looking he was he was cute but not handsome by any means and besides he was kinda short anyway i watched it off and on for years but i am so sick and tired of tv stations playing this in reruns over and over again im now sick of the show again and hate it once more i did go through a spell where i liked the show but i really didnt feel for any of the characters no matter how deep they tried to pretend to be i still found them all fake and phoney now in almost two decades since the show started it seems that local stations are contractually obligated to play this series to death or i should say way past its death there are newer fresher funnier shows like rock that have jokes and humor of today in and not from a decade that people dont act like anymore i wish more tv stations would play newer shows like rock or something else one reason i got rid of cable was the limited handful of reruns they owned dont get me wrong i love reruns but there is such a tiny supply of shows on tv these days on the internet there are hundreds of shows to choose from while that dinosaur tv hits us over the head with shallow peppy plastic shows like friends i dont care how deep they tried to come off that show was total and utter phoney garbage now who ever owns the rights to friends is forcing the local tv stations to play them over and over again until we all die a little inside i know i can turn the station or go back to the superior internet but there are times when i come home at night and would like to turn on the tv and have them present me with something enjoyable fresh today and actually funny sure the characters on rock come off as hipsters too but they meant to be hipsters they are meant to be absurd and thats what makes it funny but friends is so obnoxiously transparent i cant believe that it has the tv contracts that it does its a cute show but so arent a lot of things a plastic doll is cute but thats all it is plastic if friends were to disappear forever i for one would not miss it at all if i ever see this show again it will be too soon,NEGATIVE

The only show where I can first binge it for 2 weeks and finish it during a summer when I was younger. And the only show where I can sit down and watch one episode for 30 minutes even if I saw it before.

861,861,9.0,15 June 2020,"I am a gen z 2000s kid and have heard a lot about 'F.R.I.E.N.D.S'. Never gave it a try because it looked the most 90s show ever, and yes it is.

Pandemic happened and everybody is worrying and panicking, so I said I will try to watch a sitcom to forget about all the sh!t around me. I watched friends as it had the highest ratings.

God was I addicted, 236 episodes in 65 days, people have done better than me but for me this is a lot. Even when I wasn't watching the show I was laughing while playing the clips in my head.

Many complain for the use of laugh-track but I see no problem with that, it is a scientific fact that if others laugh around you, you too break into laughter ( I am pretty sure this was the reason old sitcoms had those)

My most laugh-out-loud moments that I felt didn't reach high internet fame were -Chandler and Joey with Ben, and Chandler says 'what kind of scary-a$s clown came to your party' -Joey going to Rachel Boss and asking why he wanted to buy Rachel's daughter -Janice showing up

In all these scenes I fell from the place I was sitting in laughter

I have already made so many great memories with the show, Janice showing up as she dates Ross, I screamed Ohh Myy Goooddd! in the most Janice way possible. My parents on the other room starts scream as to what happened to me.

I remember a time when I was having great agony and started watching an episode and just forgot everything I was going through.

It actually felt like having Friends in Real life. I knew everything, every secret, every little detail that another friend knows.

Loved every stereotypical roles they had, Joey getting dumber as seasons progress was a wise decision as Dumb Joey had more comedic moments that will stick with me forever. Early Jo felt a weaker version of Chandler's Sarcasm. Phoebe being the different friend was fantastic as she brought something different, idk what but she's different and love these kind of characters

I relate to mostly Chandler's comedy Ross's geekness Joey's idiotic remarks ( I still regret some of my idiotic moments)

Definitely ganna rewatch the show in future and ganna watch it with more time so I live in the friends world for longer

One the best time passing shows I have ever seen. All I know is that I will always have Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Dr.Drake Ramoray and Ragina Phalange to make to laugh.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am a gen z s kid and have heard a lot about friends never gave it a try because it looked the most s show ever and yes it is pandemic happened and everybody is worrying and panicking so i said i will try to watch a sitcom to forget about all the sht around me i watched friends as it had the highest ratings god was i addicted episodes in days people have done better than me but for me this is a lot even when i wasnt watching the show i was laughing while playing the clips in my head many complain for the use of laughtrack but i see no problem with that it is a scientific fact that if others laugh around you you too break into laughter i am pretty sure this was the reason old sitcoms had those my most laughoutloud moments that i felt didnt reach high internet fame were chandler and joey with ben and chandler says what kind of scaryas clown came to your party joey going to rachel boss and asking why he wanted to buy rachels daughter janice showing up in all these scenes i fell from the place i was sitting in laughter i have already made so many great memories with the show janice showing up as she dates ross i screamed ohh myy goooddd in the most janice way possible my parents on the other room starts scream as to what happened to me i remember a time when i was having great agony and started watching an episode and just forgot everything i was going through it actually felt like having friends in real life i knew everything every secret every little detail that another friend knows loved every stereotypical roles they had joey getting dumber as seasons progress was a wise decision as dumb joey had more comedic moments that will stick with me forever early jo felt a weaker version of chandlers sarcasm phoebe being the different friend was fantastic as she brought something different idk what but shes different and love these kind of characters i relate to mostly chandlers comedy rosss geekness joeys idiotic remarks i still regret some of my idiotic moments definitely ganna rewatch the show in future and ganna watch it with more time so i live in the friends world for longer one the best time passing shows i have ever seen all i know is that i will always have ross rachel chandler monica drdrake ramoray and ragina phalange to make to laugh,POSITIVE

901,901,10.0,18 March 2002,"It is really sad that this show gets as mush praise as it does. I actually read a user comment that this show was the best sitcom ever. Guess if that comment came from a male or female.

Are there any women out there who find this show boring and totally sucky? I think it would take the common idiot 5 minutes to write an episode of this show. How long would it take to write an episode of Simpsons,

Seinfeld, Wings...?? This show is about as clever and predictable as a Jennifer Aniston movie. Oh wait, shes in this miserable excuse for a sitcom.

The talent of these actors rank up there with the uncanny ability of Julia Roberts to play such a wide variety of roles.

I perdict that the next pile of garbage called ""Friends"" will contain the following:

LeBlanc being an idiot and saying ""How you doin."" Aniston being so worked up about something so low and thoughless it makes anyone with an education higher than the third grade more stupid. Perry saying something sarcastic as ""I know you are but what am I"" Schwimmer saying ""Awww Rach"" I guess Cox and Phoebe just run around like morons. I cant wait till the day this show is gone from my life forever.

911,911,8.0,29 March 2004,"The over extended story of six young people looking for love with the right guy or gal was funny for a while, but eventually ran out of steam. It boasted many memorable moments, but also plenty of groaners to go with it, usually in the form of various guest stars who's guest spots were pretty badly exploited and under utilized (like Bruce Willis, Ben Stiller, Alec Baldwin, Jon Lovitz, etc). Billy Crystal & Robin Williams had a fun bit once though, but Tom Selleck was the only guest star to have actually had a respectable character.

When they came up with the Joey/Rachael storyline coupled with Rachael getting pregnant and giving birth to baby Emma, the wheels had most definitely fallen off the wagon.

But then again, that should have been obvious from the 1999 season finale in Las Vegas. The only real highlight of that finale was watching the Rachael dis-robes and walks around naked in her apartment sequence, allowing everyone a look at the then 29 going on 30 Jennifer Aniston bear her 5'5"" figure in the dark lit sets of Warner Brothers. The staff clearly spent the last of their talent writing that scene and Rachael's embarrassment at dis-robing herself even though there was no one around to see her naked and her quick adjustment to being naked in her home and the forbidden joy of it.

934,934,9.0,3 June 2023,"Friends, the beloved TV series that captured the hearts of millions, continues to be a timeless classic that stands the test of time. From its debut in 1994 to its final episode in 2004, Friends has left an indelible mark on popular culture, and its influence can still be felt today.

The show revolves around a group of six friends - Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe - living in New York City. The writing is sharp, the humor is clever, and the characters are incredibly well-developed, each with their unique quirks and personalities that complement one another perfectly. It's this ensemble cast and their remarkable chemistry that truly makes Friends shine.

The humor in Friends is effortlessly relatable, and the show expertly balances laugh-out-loud moments with heartfelt emotions. Whether it's Ross's geeky antics, Joey's lovable cluelessness, or Chandler's witty one-liners, there is a character for everyone to root for and connect with. The show's ability to tackle both comedic and dramatic storylines showcases its versatility and keeps viewers engaged throughout.

One of the show's biggest strengths lies in its ability to depict the ups and downs of life in a realistic yet lighthearted manner. From career challenges to romantic entanglements, Friends explores the complexities of adulthood, friendship, and love, resonating with audiences of all ages. The characters' journeys and growth over the course of ten seasons feel authentic and make the show all the more compelling.

Another standout aspect of Friends is its memorable supporting cast, including the iconic Gunther, Ross and Monica's parents, and a host of other recurring characters. These secondary characters add depth and flavor to the show, often stealing the spotlight with their hilarious moments and unique personalities.

Furthermore, Friends' theme song, ""I'll Be There for You"" by The Rembrandts, has become an anthem for friendship, perfectly encapsulating the show's spirit and the enduring bond shared by the central characters.

935,935,10.0,29 May 2023,"Friends"" is a 1994 to 2004 American television sitcom. Created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, it follows the lives of six friends-Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe-living in Manhattan, New York City. The series became incredibly popular during its original run and has since gained a large and dedicated fan base around the world. Here's a review of the show:

""Friends"" is widely regarded as one of the most iconic sitcoms of all time, and for good reason. Its success can be attributed to a combination of brilliant writing, talented cast performances, and a perfect blend of comedy and heartfelt moments. The show managed to capture the essence of friendship, love, and the ups and downs of life in a relatable and entertaining manner.

One of the standout aspects of ""Friends"" is its ensemble cast. The chemistry between the six main characters is undeniable, and their interactions are both hilarious and endearing. Each character brings something unique to the group dynamic, whether it's Ross's nerdy personality, Rachel's fashion-forward mindset, Monica's perfectionism, Chandler's sarcastic wit, Joey's lovable goofiness, or Phoebe's free-spirited nature. The cast's comedic timing and delivery are impeccable, elevating the already excellent writing to new heights.

The writing in ""Friends"" is consistently strong throughout its ten-season run. The show manages to balance lighthearted humor with more poignant and emotional storylines. From the on-again, off-again relationship between Ross and Rachel to the enduring friendship between the group, the show explores a wide range of themes with sincerity and wit. The humor is often clever and witty, and the dialogue is filled with memorable one-liners that have become ingrained in popular culture.

Another notable aspect of ""Friends"" is its ability to address relatable issues and milestones that many viewers can identify with. Whether it's navigating career challenges, relationship struggles, or the complexities of adult life, the show tackles these topics with authenticity and humor. It has a timeless quality that continues to resonate with audiences, even years after its conclusion.

That being said, some critics argue that the show's lack of diversity and occasional reliance on dated stereotypes can be problematic. While the characters are well-developed and lovable, the series could have been more inclusive in terms of representing different backgrounds and perspectives.

Overall, ""Friends"" remains a classic sitcom that has left an indelible mark on popular culture. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its universal appeal and the enduring power of friendship. With its charming characters, witty writing, and memorable moments, it's a show that continues to bring joy to audiences of all ages.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a to american television sitcom created by david crane and marta kauffman it follows the lives of six friendsross rachel monica chandler joey and phoebeliving in manhattan new york city the series became incredibly popular during its original run and has since gained a large and dedicated fan base around the world heres a review of the show friends is widely regarded as one of the most iconic sitcoms of all time and for good reason its success can be attributed to a combination of brilliant writing talented cast performances and a perfect blend of comedy and heartfelt moments the show managed to capture the essence of friendship love and the ups and downs of life in a relatable and entertaining manner one of the standout aspects of friends is its ensemble cast the chemistry between the six main characters is undeniable and their interactions are both hilarious and endearing each character brings something unique to the group dynamic whether its rosss nerdy personality rachels fashionforward mindset monicas perfectionism chandlers sarcastic wit joeys lovable goofiness or phoebes freespirited nature the casts comedic timing and delivery are impeccable elevating the already excellent writing to new heights the writing in friends is consistently strong throughout its tenseason run the show manages to balance lighthearted humor with more poignant and emotional storylines from the onagain offagain relationship between ross and rachel to the enduring friendship between the group the show explores a wide range of themes with sincerity and wit the humor is often clever and witty and the dialogue is filled with memorable oneliners that have become ingrained in popular culture another notable aspect of friends is its ability to address relatable issues and milestones that many viewers can identify with whether its navigating career challenges relationship struggles or the complexities of adult life the show tackles these topics with authenticity and humor it has a timeless quality that continues to resonate with audiences even years after its conclusion that being said some critics argue that the shows lack of diversity and occasional reliance on dated stereotypes can be problematic while the characters are welldeveloped and lovable the series could have been more inclusive in terms of representing different backgrounds and perspectives overall friends remains a classic sitcom that has left an indelible mark on popular culture its enduring popularity is a testament to its universal appeal and the enduring power of friendship with its charming characters witty writing and memorable moments its a show that continues to bring joy to audiences of all ages,POSITIVE

there are 2 ways of looking at this: 1, that americans are by nature more amenable to giving and taking sarcastic comments and they dont take these personally. 2, that this is just comedic license on the part of the writers of this show.

where does informality end and rudeness begin? the characters seem to have little in common, in several shows they've said to each others faces what they find wrong with the other......this is said in a spirit of irritation rather than honest confession.....so what makes them stick together? what makes them Friends?

986,986,1.0,23 August 2008,"""Friends"" is the TV show of a generation. Having rewatched all the episodes recently I was pleasantly taken back to my youth. In hindsight it's quite obvious why this show was such a success. Aside from the fact that all the main actors had an undeniable chemistry going on, the writers understood perfectly which fears and sorrows occupied young people at the time and incorporated them into the shows: fighting for independence from your parents and struggling to stand on your own two feet (Rachel), having to deal with your shyness and working in a job that you hate (Chandler), coming to terms with indifferent parents (Monica) or a troubled youth (Phoebe) or having to accept that your early attempts at starting a family already failed (Ross).

Of course, ""Friends"" was not a downer. These troubles where dealt with, but in a light way. The Friends always had each other and their youth. They had trendy haircuts and made hanging out at the coffee house the cool thing for a new generation.

The stories were charming, the jokes funny, if harmless. Maybe the show was a bit too clean cut at times (I'm referring to stuff like the inclusion of Hootie & The Blowfish), but then there were some naughty sexual references, too, especially in the early seasons.

Cleverly, the story lines were always adjusted to the age of the characters, so audiences could grow with Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, Rachel and Joey. ""Friends"" was always something the dedicated fan could identify him- or herself with. That's also why the show maintained its high quality for most of its run  with the exception of the tenth and final season, where the actors wanted to move on, pushing writers to wrap up the Ross/Rachel-storyline quicker than it could have been wrapped up.

Anyway, ""Friends"" has become a TV classic. It managed to capture the attitude to life of a whole generation. The final episode is very touching because when the Friends part it's like saying goodbye to a part of your own youth. Still, all things must pass, and I'm glad ""Friends"" ended on a very high level. Every generation has its TV show. This one is mine.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the tv show of a generation having rewatched all the episodes recently i was pleasantly taken back to my youth in hindsight its quite obvious why this show was such a success aside from the fact that all the main actors had an undeniable chemistry going on the writers understood perfectly which fears and sorrows occupied young people at the time and incorporated them into the shows fighting for independence from your parents and struggling to stand on your own two feet rachel having to deal with your shyness and working in a job that you hate chandler coming to terms with indifferent parents monica or a troubled youth phoebe or having to accept that your early attempts at starting a family already failed ross of course friends was not a downer these troubles where dealt with but in a light way the friends always had each other and their youth they had trendy haircuts and made hanging out at the coffee house the cool thing for a new generation the stories were charming the jokes funny if harmless maybe the show was a bit too clean cut at times im referring to stuff like the inclusion of hootie the blowfish but then there were some naughty sexual references too especially in the early seasons cleverly the story lines were always adjusted to the age of the characters so audiences could grow with chandler monica ross phoebe rachel and joey friends was always something the dedicated fan could identify him or herself with thats also why the show maintained its high quality for most of its run with the exception of the tenth and final season where the actors wanted to move on pushing writers to wrap up the rossrachelstoryline quicker than it could have been wrapped up anyway friends has become a tv classic it managed to capture the attitude to life of a whole generation the final episode is very touching because when the friends part its like saying goodbye to a part of your own youth still all things must pass and im glad friends ended on a very high level every generation has its tv show this one is mine,POSITIVE

996,996,9.0,8 October 2020,"Friends had great, and not so great moments. Mainly everything after season eight finale. I still can't believe how it lost its spark, so close to the finish line. Writers were desperately trying to give characters closure. But did they really needed any? As far as I'm concerned, the show worked best by not overthinking things. And the best episodes involved a contest, a feud, a random basketball game, or a secret discovered. The show worked best, without a safety net. To me it is the most iconic 90s series. And has such a brilliant aura. It simply lifts your spirit up, whenever you need it the most. The theme song is corny and repetitive, but you wouldn't dare imagining the episodes without it. I don't get some of the hate these characters get, especially today. But I definitely remember that Joey got on my nerves, very often. And its no secret the worst plot of the series, involved him and another « hated » main character. Things were at their best for the show, through seasons 2 to 6. Then it slowly declined, to reach its « full potential » by season 9. Season 1 is good, but still leaves me more or less satisfied, each time. And season 3, has storylines I don't like. Season 2, 4 and 5, however, are my favorite, and most watched years of them all. I'm not going to list my favorite moments and episodes, though. It would take forever, and I'm sure I would still not be satisfied with it. As they tend to change a lot over the years. But people can keep whatever show they think is best. To me, this one is it.

Fine for fantasy...but it is not a realistic portrayal of life. I'm not complaining, just responding to a previous comment.

Here are some facts: 1) There is no way an unemployed singer (Phoebe), an unemployed fashion plate/waitress (Rachel) and a chef could live in a multi-bedroom apt. with a fabulous view in NYC. It would cost $6,000/month! Are you telling me that one person is paying for it all?

2) Across the hall, the rarely employed actor and the statistician are going to foot the rent on that place? Not.

3) Do you know a lot of people that carry their brother's child? And that have the same name as their mother?

4) If they are all vaguely employed (some more than others), how do they have time to constantly be sitting around, drinking coffee, listening to Phoebe sing, chilling at the girls' apt., etc.? People work.

I'm sure I have more, but I have to go do real things now. Anyway, my point is only that this is NOT a realistic picture of life in a major metropolitan U.S. city. It costs too much to have that much leisure time.

Then i start to think what was this that made FRIENDS the way it is

The characters are likable, relatable and pretty legit for the time

The situations they go into are the situations almost each of us get into

Your reactions would be the same if you had friends such as them

No convoluted plot points to make sure you savor the moment

Every character was given equal importance and their part in making sure you tear up

There was no re-casting, which made you so involved

Every guest appearance was unique in their own terms, they were not stereotypical, characters and just felt like part of the team

Friendshp is personified, work life balance depicted in the best way

It does not strive hard to spread any message at all, which makes it a treat to the eyes The jokes are timed perfect, sarcasm is used appropriately

Premise is way too simple and so is the end. It just feels like end of a episode but its the end of series.

Everyone's job is unique despite the fact that they were in high school together

I don't think any show was made biggest public influences than this None of the cast of any other TV show was on Oprah explaining to whole world their personal aftermaths of ending the sit-com I just could keep going on and on. but the list would be endless and it would different from every person's perspective of life and that again is a success. Each person could look at these episodes from their lens of life and can relate to them. Any party i have been whenever i say can we watch FRIENDS, there has never been a NO. That is how powerful and loving this is and By the way the opening song, best for any Sit-com.

I hated that they ended it, but looking at the actors now, i think its good that they did. They had their run and it has to stop somewhere and they stopped at the right time.

1044,1044,10.0,14 October 2021,"I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if this was the first sitcom I ever saw I would give it a 10/10 and place it as my number 1 without thinking twice.

Given my exposure to sitcoms started some time ago, my attachment to them was stronger on the first ones I saw, however rationally speaking I am fully aware that ""Friends"" was the one that started all and that there's a huge amount of elements that were taken as ""inspiration"" to make the more modern ones like How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, etc and I need to give full credit on the original idea and the phenomenon this has become.

For the time it was made, a lot of the jokes and even the way the series was shot was ahead of its time, seeing it in 2021 you can feel it being so relatable and so contemporary even if there are some themes that might've not been so well received these days, it's still an amazing accomplishment in comedy.

It's impossible not to be attached to the characters, their chemistry is insanely good, which in part I believe relates a lot with the good real life relationship the actors had, as a fan of physical comedy there were a lot of pure comedic moments coming from characters like Chandler or Ross which I found hilarious.

It was an original and ground breaking story and specially method of story telling, an up lifting type of TV show where you wouldn't see any other actor that would portray their roles. Outside of the comedy aspect the story as whole is good and it has its fair share of dramatic tear dropping moments, for me one if its highlights was (small spoiler ahead) the scenes where Ross and Rachel first get together and when they first break up - they are so raw and sincere, it was one of the best real romantic scenes I've seen in a movie or on TV given how cheesy they usually are.

The ended well which is very important on a show like this, I guess the main reason I don't give the highest score is because there were a lot of times during the course of the show where I felt it became a bit repetitive, with similar jokes and the whole Ross and Rachel relationship was very dragged as well - also Chandler ends in a high note but has a lot of seasons where he seems irrelevant, which I guess might relate with the real life struggles of the actor but still was a bit painful to watch - in summary its a must see sitcom and deserves all the recognition it gets for being the pioneer.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if this was the first sitcom i ever saw i would give it a and place it as my number without thinking twice given my exposure to sitcoms started some time ago my attachment to them was stronger on the first ones i saw however rationally speaking i am fully aware that friends was the one that started all and that theres a huge amount of elements that were taken as inspiration to make the more modern ones like how i met your mother the big bang theory etc and i need to give full credit on the original idea and the phenomenon this has become for the time it was made a lot of the jokes and even the way the series was shot was ahead of its time seeing it in you can feel it being so relatable and so contemporary even if there are some themes that mightve not been so well received these days its still an amazing accomplishment in comedy its impossible not to be attached to the characters their chemistry is insanely good which in part i believe relates a lot with the good real life relationship the actors had as a fan of physical comedy there were a lot of pure comedic moments coming from characters like chandler or ross which i found hilarious it was an original and ground breaking story and specially method of story telling an up lifting type of tv show where you wouldnt see any other actor that would portray their roles outside of the comedy aspect the story as whole is good and it has its fair share of dramatic tear dropping moments for me one if its highlights was small spoiler ahead the scenes where ross and rachel first get together and when they first break up they are so raw and sincere it was one of the best real romantic scenes ive seen in a movie or on tv given how cheesy they usually are the ended well which is very important on a show like this i guess the main reason i dont give the highest score is because there were a lot of times during the course of the show where i felt it became a bit repetitive with similar jokes and the whole ross and rachel relationship was very dragged as well also chandler ends in a high note but has a lot of seasons where he seems irrelevant which i guess might relate with the real life struggles of the actor but still was a bit painful to watch in summary its a must see sitcom and deserves all the recognition it gets for being the pioneer,POSITIVE

1054,1054,10.0,12 March 2009,"Friends' greatest strength is that it invites us into a lifestyle that we'd want to live. You've got your six friends, and they're all you need, and you're always having a good time. No, the show isn't always funny. Certainly, no, it's not always smart. But, at the end of the day, it's always a place you'd love to be a part of, and that's why it's worthy of high acclaim.

The first couple of seasons of the show were comprised of mostly entirely interesting episodes. Afterwards, the episodes were mostly good - albeit with usually at least one boring, obligatory plot line - and come the final few seasons, most of the comedy got downright stupid (the episode where Phoebe tries to teach Joey French is embarrassing) and you could tell the writers were clutching at straws.

Again, though, despite these flaws that need to be addressed, the show was always worthwhile.

1057,1057,10.0,31 December 2023,"I won't say one of the best, but after this T. V show with 10 seasons is over, of course, the problem is that why it ended... Probably most of the shows, web series movies are known from memes or reels.

Also this show was seen frequently in reels... in youtube netflix made a 12 minute video with Dhruv Rathi on the popularity of this show (maybe a promotion episode), but after watching it in full I was really surprised that it was so popular. Is it...?

The producers of this show today earn 1 billion dollars through this show from different platforms.

This means that this show earns the producers every year as much money as it takes to be among the top 18 highest grosser movies in the world.

Moreover, the main six actors of the show get 2 million dollars each as royalties every year.

Moreover, as many as 14 writers have written this show together... After hearing all this, I did not stop and started.

Watched 3 episodes as they are introductory so some of my friends stopped watching the show, but since each episode is 22 to 23 minutes long, I was patient and watched 😅 Because in 1994, his lifestyle seemed much more advanced than our current life style... But after 3-4 episodes, Ja Rangat comes in this show for sure it will take you till the tenth season.....👍 Because every episode is different but heavy...

Each episode has a different topic, each actor gets the same amount of screen time... And at the end of the episode, a funny anecdote shown in the last thirty seconds of the episode makes it even more interesting.

Check each character... *Monica*, who is obsessed with neatness, cleanliness, *Chandlar*, the unintelligible comedian.

Most understanding and intelligent, but unlucky when it comes to marriage😅 *Ross* Beautiful and stylish *Rachel* A crazy rhymer *Pheebe* And the funniest character in the show *Joe* It is definitely fun to see all the fun they do together I love Joe and Monica out of all of them...😀","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i wont say one of the best but after this t v show with seasons is over of course the problem is that why it ended probably most of the shows web series movies are known from memes or reels also this show was seen frequently in reels in youtube netflix made a minute video with dhruv rathi on the popularity of this show maybe a promotion episode but after watching it in full i was really surprised that it was so popular is it the producers of this show today earn billion dollars through this show from different platforms this means that this show earns the producers every year as much money as it takes to be among the top highest grosser movies in the world moreover the main six actors of the show get million dollars each as royalties every year moreover as many as writers have written this show together after hearing all this i did not stop and started watched episodes as they are introductory so some of my friends stopped watching the show but since each episode is to minutes long i was patient and watched because in his lifestyle seemed much more advanced than our current life style but after episodes ja rangat comes in this show for sure it will take you till the tenth season because every episode is different but heavy each episode has a different topic each actor gets the same amount of screen time and at the end of the episode a funny anecdote shown in the last thirty seconds of the episode makes it even more interesting check each character monica who is obsessed with neatness cleanliness chandlar the unintelligible comedian most understanding and intelligent but unlucky when it comes to marriage ross beautiful and stylish rachel a crazy rhymer pheebe and the funniest character in the show joe it is definitely fun to see all the fun they do together i love joe and monica out of all of them,POSITIVE

1093,1093,10.0,8 March 2023,"'Friends' is the very first TV show that I watched and it still literally stands out among all the series that I've ever watched. It was aired in 1994 on NBC and has been one of the greatest hits ever. The genre is comedy. I had watched all ten seasons of it in 2020 for the first time and have been watching as the second time now. It definitely is one of my all-time favorite sitcoms.

It is my little sister who recommended me to give it a try. To be honest, the first couple of episodes are just meh and unexceptional from my point of view. It couldn't catch my attention much. But I happened to keep watching with just the only purpose of enriching vocabularies and improving American slang words. Then, I became addicted to it without knowing myself. This is my second time watching yet it doesn't fail to make me laugh. It completely exceeds my expectations.

The show revolves around six unique adults; Monica (Courteney Cox), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Ross (David Schwimmer), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), Chandler (Matthew Perry), and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), living in New York. It portrays their unbreakable friendship, helping each other through thick and thin, relationships, life and personal issues, how they overcome life struggles and adventures. The unique personalities of the main six characters and the chemistry between them are the main reasons why the viewers are attracted to easily binge-watch at any time of the day.

Monica, a chef, is the one with the OCD (obsesses over details), she is competitive, organized and loves being the hostess. Rachel, a waitress and who wants to work in the fashion industry, is spoiled, but independent and energetic and has a playful nature. Ross, a paleontologist, is thorough and detail-oriented as a scientist and professor. He has three failed marriages and the rollercoaster relationship with Rachel. Joey, a struggling actor, is funny and knows how to take pleasure in everything around him. He is fun-loving, sociable and always full of energy. Chandler whose job is in data processing, is smart, sarcastic and loving. He constantly jokes around his friends. Phoebe, a masseuse, has a quirky character and is sympathetic and committed to her friends.

The characters are unique and engaging. Each character has their own set of ups and downs. I love how they stick by and love each other through all their time together. The show highlights the importance of having friends in life and how they can make your days more alive.

The cliffhangers at the end of some seasons are also very suspenseful and this is one of the series that I won't get bored to rewatch it. The ending is also flawless. Though it has been many years after the show came out, it is still a hit, fresh and amazing. It is a MUST-WATCH. I love this series so much and it is worth your time, go watch it, you won't regret it.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is the very first tv show that i watched and it still literally stands out among all the series that ive ever watched it was aired in on nbc and has been one of the greatest hits ever the genre is comedy i had watched all ten seasons of it in for the first time and have been watching as the second time now it definitely is one of my alltime favorite sitcoms it is my little sister who recommended me to give it a try to be honest the first couple of episodes are just meh and unexceptional from my point of view it couldnt catch my attention much but i happened to keep watching with just the only purpose of enriching vocabularies and improving american slang words then i became addicted to it without knowing myself this is my second time watching yet it doesnt fail to make me laugh it completely exceeds my expectations the show revolves around six unique adults monica courteney cox rachel jennifer aniston ross david schwimmer joey matt leblanc chandler matthew perry and phoebe lisa kudrow living in new york it portrays their unbreakable friendship helping each other through thick and thin relationships life and personal issues how they overcome life struggles and adventures the unique personalities of the main six characters and the chemistry between them are the main reasons why the viewers are attracted to easily bingewatch at any time of the day monica a chef is the one with the ocd obsesses over details she is competitive organized and loves being the hostess rachel a waitress and who wants to work in the fashion industry is spoiled but independent and energetic and has a playful nature ross a paleontologist is thorough and detailoriented as a scientist and professor he has three failed marriages and the rollercoaster relationship with rachel joey a struggling actor is funny and knows how to take pleasure in everything around him he is funloving sociable and always full of energy chandler whose job is in data processing is smart sarcastic and loving he constantly jokes around his friends phoebe a masseuse has a quirky character and is sympathetic and committed to her friends the characters are unique and engaging each character has their own set of ups and downs i love how they stick by and love each other through all their time together the show highlights the importance of having friends in life and how they can make your days more alive the cliffhangers at the end of some seasons are also very suspenseful and this is one of the series that i wont get bored to rewatch it the ending is also flawless though it has been many years after the show came out it is still a hit fresh and amazing it is a mustwatch i love this series so much and it is worth your time go watch it you wont regret it,POSITIVE
1094,1094,1.0,8 March 2019,"I just finished re-watching Friends on Netflix, and I must say that the show still holds up pretty well. The first five seasons are undoubtedly better than the latter-half, which is more dramatic than the first seasons, but overall it's a pretty solid show.

The show was never as intelligent as Seinfeld, but the chemistry between the actors compensates that. My only complaining are the homophobic and sexist jokes. I know that the show is product of it's time, so I don't feel particularly offended, but I must say that Seinfeld which was from the same era, has aged far better than Friends on this regard(not that there's anything wrong with that!).

1095,1095,10.0,11 June 2004,"It's a very special thing when a television show can cross that line from being just another show, to appointment television. That's what happened here, about six twenty-somethings with exaggerated facial expressions and manic line-readings who live each other's adventures in Manhattan over a ten year period. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the first season, which contained standard sitcom annoyances. Such as HEAVY laughtrack usage after unfunny jokes and characters, who when a friend's date would show up, would all aline near the front door and lean on each other and say ""hi"" all at once. Ugh, this show will be axed after six episodes.

But with little competition on other networks in the 8:30 slot (and a hell of an attractive cast) this show dragged on through a whole season. Things finally perked up with an unrequited crush between two of the main characters, which culminated in a terrific cliffhanger. Then something happened in season two, and the writers just exploded. From then on out over the next five years, this show couldn't miss. Constant on-target jokes, a newly budding romance with a great pay-off, and one of the fastest paces of any sitcom ever. Instead of the usual two-story structure, a third sub-story was added which made the 22 minutes fly by each week. The executive producers names would come up, and literally every week, I'd cry out in frustration: ""It's done already??"". But after around season six, viewage dropped and the show went onto cruise control. It still made you laugh, but wasn't as flawless. Then amazingly (mostly due in part to 9/11 after effects of wanting to smile again) the ratings soared back to number 1 where they stayed till the show went off the air three years later. As far as performances go, the actors were all terrific choices. Aniston really evolved from the spoiled rich girl to a successful, career-minded professional. Cox's neurotic tendencies were played for good laughs, but weren't overdone, wisely. And she had a great softness and emotion to her many romantic moments over the run. Two characters however, remained in a realm of intolerance as a viewer.

The Phoebe character portrayed by Kudrow, was completely unrealistic in her quirkyness, and I think would not be accepted by anyone as a friend. This left her character undefined, as they focused mainly on her family background for most of the first five or six years, and never giving her a solid romance like the other characters. Then you had LeBlanc as the token dumb stud, a guy who constantly misconstrued information and bugged his eyes reveling in the joy of the prospect of living in a supermarket of eating a sandwich. He made you laugh but at times was too stupid for even TV. LeBlanc could be great in his serious moments, but that distracted from his lack of intelligence in other episodes. His would-be romance with Aniston's character was rightly abandoned as it just didn't play right.

This brings us to the most unbalanced character of them all, Ross, played by Schwimmer. In the beginning he was the most rounded character who was going through a divorce after being abandoned by his pregnant lesbian wife. Far-fetched sure, but at least he brought an authentic turmoil to his role. Plus his secret affection for Aniston's character made you really root for him. HOWEVER, by season six or seven, the writers had him do a complete 180 and turn increasingly unbearable with his wild outbursts and disturbing mood swings. The idiotic handling of his post-break up years with Aniston was infuriating. IT'S OVER, MOVE ON! Yet, the two characters always had to stare at each other dramatically when the other would start dating again. This followed by the most embarrassing episode where Schwimmer gets drunk and carries on like a woman upon finding out LeBlanc and Aniston have a thing going. ""I'm fiiiiiine!"" will go down in the annals along with ""We were on a break!!"" (which was classic).

For last I've saved Matthew Perry, who in my mind was the second coming of John Ritter. An expertly gifted physical actor, who patented his own uprorious line deliveries and facial reactions. He was the writers go to guy early on in the show---too much in fact. Chandler was just a walking punchline, trying way too hard. But in years following, they toned it down and turned him into one of the best TV characters I've ever seen. Not just standard jokes, but great inside references only some of us folks would get. Which made his dramatic moments shine even more, the few he had. Chandler Bing will be missed. The finale was a tremendous let-down, going in bland directions and really lacking an emotional conclusion. Nothing is really resolved as they lay on the guitars thick for a final fade out (on a door????). In summation, it was one of those shows I really don't see recreated again, with the type of snappy dialogue and lovable characters who you will watch into syndication infinity like other shows.

1107,1107,10.0,1 December 2006,"Caveat: The Oxford American Dictionary defines ""comedy,"" as ""1. a light, amusing play, film, television production, etc. 2. the branch of drama that consists of such plays."" Please note the absence of any reference to reality, realism, plausibility, etc. It has been awhile since I took a course on film criticism, but I distinctly remember something about the requirement of ""suspension of disbelief."" Does anyone else remember that too? For all of you who worship at the altar of Seinfeld, Frazier, Newhart, and Cheers (shows I also relish), I believe that the same criticisms you are making of Kauffman, Bright, and Crane can also be leveled at the good folks who created those shows.

What can I say? I am not even in the target demographic for this show. I am a 57 year old, male, professional...and I have seen every TV show from ""Your Show of Shows"" on to the present. This show ranks with the very best. The show did struggle a bit to get to Year 10, but still it was always funny...and the ensemble acting was as good as anything I have ever seen.

Aniston/Cox/Kudrow/LeBlanc/Perry/Schwimmer; all winners. OK, snobbish purists...denigrate the show all you want. Aniston is this generations Lucy or Coca...and I could make similar comparisons for all of the other regulars. I realize that it is just ""too hip"" to trash the show when, of course, you realize you are just ""so far above that sort of thing,"" but you miss the point. It is funny. It ain't cerebral...it is just funny. Yeah, it has ""Ca-Ca, pooh-pooh,"" and sexual innuendo, double entendre, and cheap gags,but it also has some great stuff. Who does a double take better(and more affectedly) than LeBlanc? Who is more ditsy (for a Vassar girl) than Kudrow. Who is more witty than Perry. Who has done her best and never gotten any credit than Cox? Who tops Schwimmer for Yiddisher humor? If you are searching for a documentary about the so-called ""yuppy lifestyle,"" please turn on PBS.

Please do give us a break. We are all quite impressed by your effete sophistication and pedantry, but please, do drop your pretense and quit being so pompous! Just enjoy and have fun.

Many of you film snobs think you are the very incarnation of Roger Ebert. Well, sorry...the job is taken. It may shock some of you to realize that some of us watch TV shows because we want to be entertained, not edified, and we just want to feel good and laugh at Theater of the Absurd.

We are all really, really impressed with you cynics out there; with your trashing of this show. Can we BE more superior? I wonder how many of you have actually acted, or taken courses in television production? Probably not many. This show can be fun, even to people with a +3 Sigma IQ.

I found a lot of the writing to be pretty bad.

That's why I find it overrated. Now for some personal points: This show's particular brand of humor is not my taste. Because of this, I don't like Rachel or Monica. I can't overlook how Monica is an arrogant control-freak and that Rachel can't admit when she's wrong and she blames things on others.

The videotape! Rachel came onto Ross and she knows she did! But nope! She thought she could fool everyone into think Ross came onto her. And when it was proven otherwise I was like, ""Yeah! Take that Rachel, you liar!""

They were on a break! She wanted Ross to take responsibility for everything that went wrong between her and him! Yeah, not everything was his fault. ('If you take responsibility I can begin to trust you again.' Seriously, Rachel?) Same goes for the drunken marriage and the annulment fiasco that followed it. ('Look what you've done with your funny, funny form!'-'Me? What about you and your consummate like bunnies...' Now that I type that I realize it was entirely her fault they couldn't get an annulment!

1110,1110,10.0,15 May 2002,"As the title above says, I used to be a fan of this show, because I was able to deal with all the annoying aspects (Goddamn noisy laughs coming from nowhere and for no reason, silly plotlines, etc...) but I finally got sick of it and quit watching.

It's not only that the show is unrealistic, but the fact that the storylines have become kinda old, predictable and overused (Everybody trying and dating one another, all women pregnant or on the way to be, etc...) and the nail on the coffin to me was the appalling news that they had renewed for a ninth season. NBC should be ashamed of this. After all, as the cast haven't earned enough money so far, let's give them a few millions more.

And I can't see how someone compare Friends to Seinfeld. The latter WAS a good show, and didn't have to rely on a cute cast for ratings.

1115,1115,10.0,3 April 2007,"Well what can be said about friends that hasn't been said countless times before? Friends has been analysed and dissected so often that it's a wonder that the six actors aren't covered in bruises! There is really nothing left new to say, so all that I can do is say it again in my own, inimitable way.

Quite simply, friends is probably the funniest programme you will ever see. The jokes are exquisitely timed and thought out, and they do not rely on one kind of humour - there is witty one-liners and visual comedy, comedy gleamed from mere facial expressions and simply hilarious situations - well it is a situation comedy! The writers have managed to take the simplest situation - six twenty-something friends and their loves, careers, and family problems - and make something that is pure gold to watch.

Each twenty minute episode is jam-packed with quality gags, and not a single episode goes by without a number of laughs to be had. The writing is top quality, the acting is flawless, and the outstanding cast is constantly backed up by a superb supporting cast and a roll-call of Hollywood (and British!) talent dropping by from time to time as guest stars. But where Friends' real success lies is in making the viewers genuinely care about its' six characters - we feel for them, we laugh with them, cry with them, and we grow up with them over the course of their ten years. We see the characters change, grow, evolve over the ten series, and while they change, they also remain at the core those same twenty-something guys we became friends with.

Some say that the later series didn't have the same punch, or the same high quality of writing and performances as the earlier seasons, and to a certain extent this is true. The gags don't feel quite as tight or sharp in the later series as in those early lightning quick early season episodes, and the characters in some respects don't so much as grow as become almost caricatures of their former selves. The early personalities are still there, but grown out of all proportion. Joey gets unbelievably dumber, Chandler more and more sarcastic, Monica frighteningly OCD....you get the idea. They have become grotesque cartoon versions of their earlier selves. But yet, somehow, the magic remains. We still love them. And while the gags may not constantly stream at a dizzying height of quality towards the end, thee is still plenty there to make us laugh.

And that is where Friends succeeds above many many inferior shows. It just tries to make us laugh. Occasionally we will cry, be shocked etc as well, but never forget that Friends is a sitcom at heart. Maybe it should have been finished a couple of series earlier, or maybe we couldn't bear to let it go. One thing is for sure, the departure of this terrific sitcom left one hell of a void in our programming.

1117,1117,10.0,30 May 2006,"Brilliant. Taken sitcoms to an all new level. Since it is a Character based programme, a lot depends on the actors themselves and I must say that each actor has done his bit and conducted himself perfectly. They actually make you believe that the characters are real and are your best friends too. They make you feel as if you yourself are a part of the GROUP. I must give it to the screenplay artists and writers too. Though it is a comedy series, it has a bit of everything including emotion, romance, etc. Season 1 was basically about when the audience gets to know as to what and who these friends really are. Rachel is a spoilt girl who belongs to a rich family, trying to make her way into the city. Monica is chef who's trying to make it big time in the city. Phoebe is a mystic, funny girl with not a very pleasant past, finally getting to live a decent life in the heart of new york with a legitimate job. Chandler is a witty and funny person, with a successful job in the city, one he's not very pleased with but one which pays well. Joey on the other hand is struggling actor who is doing what he loves but something with small paychecks. Ross is the most romantic and sensitive out of the guys, but the also the most unsuccessful with his love life, as he just got divorced since his wife turned out to be a lesbian. Though a successful paleontologist, but one who is not entirely happy with his life. The way the writers have carried on these characters into new but still the same type of people is just beautiful.

For a few weeks now, now at age 27, I've been catching more re-runs on TBS, and the show is just as funny and moving as it was when I first saw it back then. Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer were the six Friends whose lives, loves, and laughs were chronicled over the course of a highly successful, 10-year run from 1994 to 2004.

As humans we were born in different places; had different experiences and this gives us our unique personality. Even though variations are wealth to this world, people have to understand specific things in order to be happy and deal with problems or to not to cause a problem to someone else. This series shows lots of examples in so many areas such as love life, health, career. And does show problems and solutions. Even though it is impossible to show all possible problem in this earth, this series can give people the main idea. Friends and family, people who could be trusted CAN help us and we SHOULD help each other (this is a fact we forget most of the time or we ignore people most of the time) ; in order to do that we have to accept each other first. No matter how different we are, with respect and understanding we can easily witness that all the behaviors have explainable backgrounds and their objectives are actually same in every human being. Consensus in a community is always possible. Loyalty makes relationships and friendships strong and keeps them satisfying thus happy. Our approach is also important too. Approach to other people and feed-backs we get from their expressions are vital for our social achievements. Those very different 6 people are good examples of all these because them being themselves didn't effect their life bad unless they forgot those rules and in the end being their selves directed them to someplace they didn't expect but would make them happy.

I don't even think about it as a show, because the characters are so alive, you are watching a bunch of wonderful people live through 10 years of their lives. You really care about them and feel sorry if something bad happens or really feel the great, funny atmosphere around them when their having fun. The actors are just great to. The producers could not have picked better actors. I must say that this show is just perfect, for you who have not watched, do that.

1175,1175,10.0,7 November 2008,"As one of the most devoted Seinfeld fans in the world, I avoided Friends like the plague for years. Though I heard many people loved it, I felt as if I would be committing treason if I were to watch it. After all, ""Friends"" versus ""Seinfeld"" is a common debate when people are discussing the top sitcoms of all time. And I was firmly entrenched on the Seinfeld side. That is, until I actually watched an episode. I'm not sure exactly how it came about, but I eventually ended up watching a Friends episode. I hated to admit it, but it was quite funny. Ah, yes, I think I remember how it happened; TBS airs Friends immediately after the Seinfeld reruns I always watch, and I guess I just didn't end up changing the channel. Boy, I'm glad I didn't. After enjoying that first episode, I decided to watch it the next day. And the next. And the next. Then I started Tivoing every episode that aired (which is quite a few, something like five or six Friends episodes are on a day, it's kind of absurd) and watching them in bunches. About a week later, I was hooked. And about 150 episodes later, I'm making my way through them all and convinced that this deserves its place right alongside Seinfeld in the comedy pantheon. There are even certain aspects of Friends which are better than Seinfeld (as difficult as that is for me to admit). Whereas Seinfeld has the edge in each episode's rewatchability factor and quotability, Friends has characters and plot lines that we care about more. The six friends actually appear inseparable and more like our personal friends than the cast of Seinfeld. The cast is pitch perfect, just like Seinfeld's; you can't imagine any other actor in any of the main roles. So, while it may have taken me a couple more years than it took most people, I finally came around on Friends. If you're one of those who haven't, maybe it's because you were a devoted Seinfeld fan like me and couldn't bear to hear the two shows compared.

1182,1182,10.0,15 December 2016,"Each one of us have different taste and preferences but if one cleaves on the point that Friends is not a great show I think one needs to find musing time to discern that they are wrong.

The first season is slow and is just like a foundation stone to make the building strong and I take it when some people find it little slow or average,but The show outstrip all the loopholes from the season 2.

The show is fabulous,stupendous and I bet you will be in light and different mood in those 20-22 minutes and there will be rampant flow of smile and laughs for those 22 minutes.

This is the only show whose episodes I can watch infinite times and each time I will last laughing loud holding my stomach.

All the six actors have played their characters ingeniously and cannot be replaced or replayed equally well by anyone else ever. The show starts with ""Monica"" being teased by her friends Chandler and Joey in the central perk coffee shop and along with the cup of coffee the show starts brimming your life with fun,excitement,happiness and emotions.

All characters are different and best in their own ways.

Monica as motherly character being piqued for even a small changes made at her house by anyone except her and always eager to cook and thus rightfully the chef by profession.

Ross brother of Monica and affable goof with profession in paleontology.For Ross or ""Doctor Ross"" the love for dinosaurs is entail and marriages(including one while he was drunk) are inevitable with the record of three divorces thanks to her first lesbian wife,second inscrutable wife and drink for the third divorce. David Schwimmer was considered for this character even before the part for Ross was written.

Rachel Green portrayed by Jennifer Aniston a naive runaway bride who met her school friend Monica in coffee shop and thus awakens the love of Ross again after so many years.The character is naive,confused and even stupid in nature but evolves independent and bold.

Chandler the character played by Matthew Perry has become pinnacle alternative for sarcasm.Chandler,the Ross college room mate to Monica's spouse is well known for his punches and lively character.

Joey is the struggling actor and was the room mate of Chandler.Joey has a charisma or art to endorse girls towards him whether its because of his innocence or famous tag line ""How you do-in"" but no love is more to him than love for food.Joey is the favorite character of mine especially because of his innocent and carefree behavior,his love for acting is appreciable so is his play,practice of hosting TV show and practicing French :-p

Phoebe the egregious,satirical,bold and confident character who has spent her childhood without parents on road among criminals thus became so strong and bold.This character does not worry about the world and its adjudication.Phoebe with her guitar and carefree nature has many self-written and self-composed songs,whether one likes her singing or not but becomes attractive towards ""Smelly Cat"" and Yes!! you can not play with this song when Phoebe is around.The character of Phoebe is also known for her recrimination however stupid it would.Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan is played by Lisa Kudrow.

1202,1202,9.0,7 July 2010,"I have read a lot of reviews and comments. Many of them really liked the show and some of them criticised for the unreal nature of it, but I for one think that this is the best comedy serial there ever has been on Television.

The first season sets up the tone for the rest of the 9 seasons. Never through out the 10 seasons it feels like the writers ever introduced something unworthy, something just to add up to the episode list, something just to pile up the story.

I will say however that towards the end Friends did start to lose what it had but, never the less was still very good. I started watching the first season when the seventh season was being aired but from then on I was hooked.

I recommend this sitcom to anyone and everyone who just loves laughing and don't wish it to stop.

1203,1203,8.0,20 January 2012,"After watching and re watching this show endlessly, I think I have finally figured out why this show is as amazing that it is:

1. Excellent writing- Unlike most sitcoms, friends combines nearly all types of comedy while still managing to pull at your heartstrings in many ways forcing you to care about the characters. The combination of these things makes this show appealing to virtually anyone, so that 3 people with 3 different types of humor will all be able to find something that makes them crack up.

2. Acting- Each of the six lead actors play their character superbly and really embody their characters. For example, Jennifer Aniston is a very famous actress now, but still when I watch friends, I refer to her as Rachel, not Jennifer. With these 6 actors comes 6 different types of comedy. Joey(Matt LeBlanc) has the dumb person comedy going, Rachel(Jennifer Aniston) works the spoiled girl next door comedy, Chandler(Matthew Perry) has the punchline and sarcastic comedy, Phoebe(Lisa Kudrow) does the honest hippie goofy comedy, Ross(David Schwimmer) does the physical/dramatic comedy, & Monica(Courtney Cox) has the up-tight obsessive competitive comedy.

and each of these actors has perfected their portrayal of said types of comedy

3. Chemistry- possibly the deciding factor of if a show will work or not, does the cast have great chemistry on and off screen? And it is blatantly obvious that the 6 'friends' were/are real friends because it shines through the chemistry they share on screen with one another. This is also the reason the jokes work. It wouldn't be believable and probably not funny without this.

With the backbone of incredible writing, actors who are masters of their character, and the chemistry that binds it all together, there is no doubt the show will be amazing.

In conclusion, friends is not your typical sitcom because it combines all styles of comedy, allowing all viewers to find a laugh but it also has characters and story lines that are not just surface level.

if you have not seen friends I suggest you watch it if for no other reason than to be a part of the world of inside jokes that are nearly common knowledge to the world today.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",after watching and re watching this show endlessly i think i have finally figured out why this show is as amazing that it is excellent writing unlike most sitcoms friends combines nearly all types of comedy while still managing to pull at your heartstrings in many ways forcing you to care about the characters the combination of these things makes this show appealing to virtually anyone so that people with different types of humor will all be able to find something that makes them crack up acting each of the six lead actors play their character superbly and really embody their characters for example jennifer aniston is a very famous actress now but still when i watch friends i refer to her as rachel not jennifer with these actors comes different types of comedy joeymatt leblanc has the dumb person comedy going racheljennifer aniston works the spoiled girl next door comedy chandlermatthew perry has the punchline and sarcastic comedy phoebelisa kudrow does the honest hippie goofy comedy rossdavid schwimmer does the physicaldramatic comedy monicacourtney cox has the uptight obsessive competitive comedy and each of these actors has perfected their portrayal of said types of comedy chemistry possibly the deciding factor of if a show will work or not does the cast have great chemistry on and off screen and it is blatantly obvious that the friends wereare real friends because it shines through the chemistry they share on screen with one another this is also the reason the jokes work it wouldnt be believable and probably not funny without this with the backbone of incredible writing actors who are masters of their character and the chemistry that binds it all together there is no doubt the show will be amazing in conclusion friends is not your typical sitcom because it combines all styles of comedy allowing all viewers to find a laugh but it also has characters and story lines that are not just surface level if you have not seen friends i suggest you watch it if for no other reason than to be a part of the world of inside jokes that are nearly common knowledge to the world today,POSITIVE

1206,1206,10.0,1 April 2007,"... you don't need any ... other comedy TV Show! ;o) I really enjoyed the show as long as it lasted. Although it all began very badly ...

My cousins in Greece asked a few years ago if I watch this show called ""Friends"". I didn't know it then, so they told me to look out for it. When I got back to Germany, I watched a few episodes on TV. Now the thing in Germany is, they do dub the movies/shows that they show on TV and on most of the cinema screens. And although they do a pretty good job mostly, they totally screwed up Friends. I watched it with the German voices and was appalled. I might have chuckled a few times, but I was mostly irritated. Especially Phoebe (one of the characters in Friends) ... I hated her! Her voice was annoying as hell.

I later watched the show in English and was amazed by it's charm, wit and humor. All the characters are well written and they have their flaws and weaknesses. Some people might argue that you can't have this idealistic friendship in New York, some others have said, that there aren't enough black people for New York. But those are minor details that don't detract from the overall good impression the show leaves.

The last season isn't as good as the other ones, but then again, ten years is a long running time.

1207,1207,9.0,27 March 2009,"First came Seinfeld, then Frasier, and finally Friends: the three sitcom milestones of the '90s. And yet only Friends is constantly mentioned when that decade comes up in conversations all over the world. What is that extra something that made it a worldwide hit, whereas the other two went pretty much unnoticed outside the States? Well, Frasier is a bit of a hard sell in non-English-speaking countries (some of the jokes get lost in translation, especially if dubbed), and Seinfeld just had the bad luck of receiving poor time slots because, like many Americans prior to 1992 (the year the fourth season went on the air), people didn't realize it was the best comedy on television. Friends, on the other hand, was a straightforward tale of six people who knew they could always rely on each other. That winning formula is what made it the most popular American sitcom of the '90s, not to mention one of the best.

Set in the quintessential sitcom city, Manhattan, the show starts in a fundamental location: the coffee shop where the six friends meet, much like the Happy Days gang used to hang out at Arnold's. It's where many of the series' key scenes happen, including the magic moment when the group is fully formed (one of them didn't actually join the ""team"" until a couple of minutes into the first episode). All of them are twenty-somethings, and each one has his or her own set of problems: Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston) must try to live by herself and not rely on her parents' credit cards anymore; Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) is always struggling to obtain her folks' approval (plus, she's obsessed with everything being like she left it in the house); Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow) refuses to accept the fact that she isn't very talented as a singer and has a penchant for weird behavior in general; Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) is very popular with the ladies, but less so when it comes to auditioning for film roles (he isn't very bright, either); Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry) is forever haunted by a messed-up childhood; and Monica's brother Ross (David Schwimmer), aside from being deeply in love with Rachel, has a tendency to whine and fall for the wrong women (he married a lesbian).

Over the course of ten years, those six characters evolve, fall in love, get married, have children and other things, though not necessarily in that order. It isn't what happens that's important, though: it's who it happens to that makes the difference. The main reason Friends lasted over 200 episodes is that it centered around those six people, and had those six actors playing them. Is it possible to imagine anyone else as the adorably dim Joey, the nerdy Ross or the feisty Phoebe? Sure, giving LeBlanc his own spin-off show was a mistake (Joey's no Frasier, for crying out loud), but for ten years he and his five co-stars kept viewers hooked to the small screen, simply because they had become a family television couldn't afford to be without. Whereas Seinfeld had the creative boldness and Frasier the wonderfully sophisticated wit, Friends lived on because it was so damn funny, and it was all due to the cast.

Of course, a Simpsons-worthy list of guest stars didn't damage the show's popularity, either. From Bruce Willis to Charlton Heston, via Sean Penn, Brad Pitt (sharing the screen with then-wife Aniston in an unexpected, very funny way) and George Clooney (spoofing his ER role alongside co-star Noah Wyle), each visiting A-lister brought something special. But at its core, the show's real value lies in the title: even now, who doesn't miss LeBlanc's ""How you doin'?"", Kudrow's vitality or Perry's mistimed puns? They were - and still are - the kind of friends everyone would want to have: honest, reliable and funny.

1219,1219,10.0,22 December 2004,"Friends is simply not funny. It's just way too overrated. I remember all the kids at my school were watching that show. I couldn't even watch a single episode. They'd keep asking me if I 'had seen Thursday's episode' or 'did Joey and Rachel (or whatever the hell their names are) get togher or break up' or whatever the hell happened.

It's not funny. It tries way too hard. It's about six people who live in New York. TOO OVERRATED, once again.

Stick with the classics: SEINFELD, THREES COMPANY, FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR. Basically, watch any sitcom on TBS or Nick At Nite except for this overrated trash, and you'll instantly fall in love. P.S. Seinfeld has, is, and always will be the best sitcom in history!

So, in the end, Friends is just way way too overrated. It isn't cool and it isn't funny. It's too uninteresting because these characters aren't like us. HELL, DO YOU KNOW A GUY WHO CAN'T HAVE KIDS? OR A GIRL WHO CAN'T HAVE KIDS? On the other hand, Seinfeld is all about 4 regular people and everything that happens to them on a daily basis.

Seinfeld is cleverly written, the way the stories interlock are somewhat Pulp Fiction-y, except there are very, very few flashbacks, like the classic Newman\Kramer at baseball game flashback. Seinfeld's scripts are smart and funny and classics. I mean, come on. How many times have you heard 'Master of your domain' and laughed? How many times have you heard some crappy quote from Friends somewhere other than the show?

Friends has got to be one of the best sitcoms I've ever seen in my life. I first watched this show in 2000 when I was five years old and I watched it with my mom a lot. And recently, I watch this show a lot on TBS. The performances in this show were outstanding, including from Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, and Matthew Perry as the main characters, the humor was so hilarious, many of the episodes were well-written, and the theme song is so unforgettable.

Friends is my #2 favorite TV show of all time, #1 being Breaking Bad. I easily recommend this show.

1227,1227,10.0,16 December 2007,"I only got into Friends last year, after watching some of the bloopers. I had seen some episodes during its original run and enjoyed them, but never followed the story of the show. Now, after watching the entirety of its 10-year run all the way through, I can safely say that Friends is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time.

Friends is one of those shows where you'll really get to know the characters. I think this is one of its greatest strengths, and part of the reason it was, and still is, so popular. By the end of the show, you will feel like they're YOUR friends - and you'll wish that you had a group of friends like them! It's impossible not to become emotionally attached to one or all of the characters, as they are each endearing in their own way.

For me, and for lots of others - as is evident from a lot of online polls and surveys - Chandler Bing (played by Matthew Perry) is the best character in the show. His sarcastic wisecracks and exceptional comic timing make him a delight to watch, especially when paired with Joey (Matt LeBlanc). Together, they make one of the most memorable TV duos - and for good reason! But whether it's Chandler and Joey you like, Monica (the obsessive neat-freak), Phoebe (the kooky masseuse), Rachel (the spoilt girl making it on her own) or Ross (the geeky but romantic college professor) you like, you're sure to find a character to relate to.

The show is also strengthened by its guest stars, especially recurring characters such as Ross and Monica's parents, Judy and Jack Geller, and Chandler's nightmare ex-girlfriend, Janice. The running gags in this show never get old, and persistent viewers are treated to in-jokes that are constantly funny.

Although I feel the show is weaker in its later seasons, due to the greater focus on plot and sentiment as opposed to the all-out comedy of some of the earlier seasons, it still stands strong on its own. And the show is not without its faults - there are a few things I would have certainly changed if I were a writer - but on the whole, they got it right, and the result is a show that fails to disappoint.

On a closing note, I'd just like to say that Friends is a show that never tries to be something it isn't - it isn't groundbreaking comedy, or incredibly high-brow, but it never aims to be. It's light, funny, and something that will cheer you up when you're feeling down. Whenever I am feeling low, I can guarantee that firing up the DVD player and watching an episode of Friends will leave me with a smile on my face. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i only got into friends last year after watching some of the bloopers i had seen some episodes during its original run and enjoyed them but never followed the story of the show now after watching the entirety of its year run all the way through i can safely say that friends is one of my favourite sitcoms of all time friends is one of those shows where youll really get to know the characters i think this is one of its greatest strengths and part of the reason it was and still is so popular by the end of the show you will feel like theyre your friends and youll wish that you had a group of friends like them its impossible not to become emotionally attached to one or all of the characters as they are each endearing in their own way for me and for lots of others as is evident from a lot of online polls and surveys chandler bing played by matthew perry is the best character in the show his sarcastic wisecracks and exceptional comic timing make him a delight to watch especially when paired with joey matt leblanc together they make one of the most memorable tv duos and for good reason but whether its chandler and joey you like monica the obsessive neatfreak phoebe the kooky masseuse rachel the spoilt girl making it on her own or ross the geeky but romantic college professor you like youre sure to find a character to relate to the show is also strengthened by its guest stars especially recurring characters such as ross and monicas parents judy and jack geller and chandlers nightmare exgirlfriend janice the running gags in this show never get old and persistent viewers are treated to injokes that are constantly funny although i feel the show is weaker in its later seasons due to the greater focus on plot and sentiment as opposed to the allout comedy of some of the earlier seasons it still stands strong on its own and the show is not without its faults there are a few things i would have certainly changed if i were a writer but on the whole they got it right and the result is a show that fails to disappoint on a closing note id just like to say that friends is a show that never tries to be something it isnt it isnt groundbreaking comedy or incredibly highbrow but it never aims to be its light funny and something that will cheer you up when youre feeling down whenever i am feeling low i can guarantee that firing up the dvd player and watching an episode of friends will leave me with a smile on my face and thats what its all about isnt it,POSITIVE

1229,1229,10.0,27 July 2007,"'Friends' is a TV executive's dream programme. It has so many episodes - 236 - that they can repeat it in an endless cycle, knowing that by the time the last ever episode is re-shown, viewers will be ready to watch the first all over again. It has become so awesomely popular that there will, at least in the foreseeable future, always be a solid fanbase, who will revel in its plasticy, gimmick-ridden world. It offers a portrait of the world that neatly correlates to an executive's own view, one in which people conform to stereotype, never think an original thought, never perform an original action, and one which safeguards against any criticisms. There's the ethnic stereotypes to appease any 'watchdogs' - the Jewish Ross and Monica; the Italian-American Joey; the ditzy, arty Phoebe; the career-minded Rachel; and the laddish Chandler. It conforms with the tedious clichés of the neurotic Jewish characters (is there a 'dysfunctional and panicky' Jewish gene?), the Italian with the enormous family (because, hey, those Catholics can really pop 'em out!), and the idea that the underachiever must always be tamed by a bossy woman. You could argue these stereotypes, like all stereotypes, have a basis in reality, but when we've seen them a million times before, do we really need to reinforce them again? Everybody seems terribly nice and sweet-natured, and you'd love to have these guys as your neighbours, if they weren't quite so bland or dull. 'Friends' is set in a universe that resembles our own, but with all the rough edges smoothed down. It's where everything, no matter how hard anyone else tries to the contrary, ends up in the same place: a boring, mushy Hallmark Valentine's Day card version of Hell. It oozes cynicism like a weeping sore. It tries so hard to be everyone's favourite show, that in the scrabble to reduce its live audience to hyenas, it frequently falls short of coming up with anything remotely funny or even interesting. Just as The Rembrandts only had one hit with the insipid theme tune, so 'Friends' only has one joke: people do wacky things. Only they're not really wacky so much as irritating; they're not 'kooky,' they're just eminently slappable. It's like a Disney version of 'Sex & the City,' where all the characters are superficial, vacuous and obnoxious in their own different, variously unpleasant ways. That said, Phoebe is the only one who comes across as likable, and Lisa Kudrow produces a good bit of empathy from a trite character. In fact, I don't think it's the actors' fault as such - we've seen them in other vehicles and, apart from Matt LeBlanc, they have shown themselves to quite talented. It's more the bland writing, the aversion to creating anything new or maybe, just maybe, exploding some clichés. But of course, it is just a sitcom, aimed largely at a young audience, which is perhaps why all six characters act like petulant eight year olds. But for a show that claims to reflect true friendship, it never portrays the real ups-and-downs of being friends with people; it's a sanitised, very boring version of friendship, where everyone is exactly the same. Nobody smokes regularly, nobody drinks heavily or takes drugs. None of them seem to have the hang-ups, the disappointments or indeed, the wonderful pipe-dreams that most real people do have. Their friendship seems to be on the condition that they speak, look and behave in a certain way. It's a bit like Disneyland, in that you can enter into it and enjoy yourself, but only if you forget that it's not just entirely fake and superficial, but that it's always governed by strict and unforgiving rules - that really seem like an inverted version of real friendship. 'Friends' is the show for the type of person who would like to deny that bad things do happen to good people, and no matter how sweet and nice you are, there's always a negative to balance the positive. But it's TV, and of course it's fantasy, but it makes for a very boring, ultimately sad fantasy, one without any drama or real excitement. Either that, or 'Friends' is a masterful satire on the banality and vacuity of modern life.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a tv executives dream programme it has so many episodes that they can repeat it in an endless cycle knowing that by the time the last ever episode is reshown viewers will be ready to watch the first all over again it has become so awesomely popular that there will at least in the foreseeable future always be a solid fanbase who will revel in its plasticy gimmickridden world it offers a portrait of the world that neatly correlates to an executives own view one in which people conform to stereotype never think an original thought never perform an original action and one which safeguards against any criticisms theres the ethnic stereotypes to appease any watchdogs the jewish ross and monica the italianamerican joey the ditzy arty phoebe the careerminded rachel and the laddish chandler it conforms with the tedious clichés of the neurotic jewish characters is there a dysfunctional and panicky jewish gene the italian with the enormous family because hey those catholics can really pop em out and the idea that the underachiever must always be tamed by a bossy woman you could argue these stereotypes like all stereotypes have a basis in reality but when weve seen them a million times before do we really need to reinforce them again everybody seems terribly nice and sweetnatured and youd love to have these guys as your neighbours if they werent quite so bland or dull friends is set in a universe that resembles our own but with all the rough edges smoothed down its where everything no matter how hard anyone else tries to the contrary ends up in the same place a boring mushy hallmark valentines day card version of hell it oozes cynicism like a weeping sore it tries so hard to be everyones favourite show that in the scrabble to reduce its live audience to hyenas it frequently falls short of coming up with anything remotely funny or even interesting just as the rembrandts only had one hit with the insipid theme tune so friends only has one joke people do wacky things only theyre not really wacky so much as irritating theyre not kooky theyre just eminently slappable its like a disney version of sex the city where all the characters are superficial vacuous and obnoxious in their own different variously unpleasant ways that said phoebe is the only one who comes across as likable and lisa kudrow produces a good bit of empathy from a trite character in fact i dont think its the actors fault as such weve seen them in other vehicles and apart from matt leblanc they have shown themselves to quite talented its more the bland writing the aversion to creating anything new or maybe just maybe exploding some clichés but of course it is just a sitcom aimed largely at a young audience which is perhaps why all six characters act like petulant eight year olds but for a show that claims to reflect true friendship it never portrays the real upsanddowns of being friends with people its a sanitised very boring version of friendship where everyone is exactly the same nobody smokes regularly nobody drinks heavily or takes drugs none of them seem to have the hangups the disappointments or indeed the wonderful pipedreams that most real people do have their friendship seems to be on the condition that they speak look and behave in a certain way its a bit like disneyland in that you can enter into it and enjoy yourself but only if you forget that its not just entirely fake and superficial but that its always governed by strict and unforgiving rules that really seem like an inverted version of real friendship friends is the show for the type of person who would like to deny that bad things do happen to good people and no matter how sweet and nice you are theres always a negative to balance the positive but its tv and of course its fantasy but it makes for a very boring ultimately sad fantasy one without any drama or real excitement either that or friends is a masterful satire on the banality and vacuity of modern life,NEGATIVE

1241,1241,9.0,26 September 2006,"'Friends' began in 1994: I was just three years old, and, as you will appreciate, not really at the right stage to watch it. By the time I was thirteen, and 'Friends' was almost finished, I was an addict. There is no other word for it.

Let's begin by analysing why this show is so funny. On paper, it may not seem it - a group of good-looking white twenty-somethings, hanging around drinking coffee and dating.

But when you look at the sheer skill of the 'Friends' writers, you have to see that this is truly comedy at its best. There are so many funny one-liners. Here, I think it would be appropriate to mention another user's comments. Someone said ""there is endless laughter after every line... so it must be funny, right?"". And the thing is, it IS right. 'Friends' is enormously funny, yet its humour is surprisingly hard to pinpoint.

The characters are highly developed, and each with their own brand of humour (so there is something for everyone). Monica, the obsessive neat-freak with a burning desire for a family; Ross, her vulnerable elder brother who seems to be the quintessential family guy yet has trouble making a marriage stick (for various reasons which I will not go into at length - lesbianism being an issue here!); Phoebe, ditzy and blonde, yet with a deep and mysterious quality; Chandler, the underdog, with the highly developed sense of sarcastic humour which is the province of only the most maligned; Joey - sweet and dumb, but with a golden heart. And then there's Rachel, the spoilt brat turned girl-about-town, who never really realises that what she's always wanted is right in front of her.

I am not going to deny that there are flaws in 'Friends' - the sentimental scenes do have more than a tinge of saccharine to them (I personally cannot watch the final episode without cringing) - and sometimes the storyline wavers a little. But the comedy - note here, the COMEDY, which is, as it should be, the essence of the show - remains intact, always.

People are always ready to critise 'Friends' for one thing or another. But the truth is, and this is backed up by the sky-high ratings, that 'Friends' does everything a sitcom should do. And it's damn funny, with it. Thank God for DVDs and re-runs.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends began in i was just three years old and as you will appreciate not really at the right stage to watch it by the time i was thirteen and friends was almost finished i was an addict there is no other word for it lets begin by analysing why this show is so funny on paper it may not seem it a group of goodlooking white twentysomethings hanging around drinking coffee and dating but when you look at the sheer skill of the friends writers you have to see that this is truly comedy at its best there are so many funny oneliners here i think it would be appropriate to mention another users comments someone said there is endless laughter after every line so it must be funny right and the thing is it is right friends is enormously funny yet its humour is surprisingly hard to pinpoint the characters are highly developed and each with their own brand of humour so there is something for everyone monica the obsessive neatfreak with a burning desire for a family ross her vulnerable elder brother who seems to be the quintessential family guy yet has trouble making a marriage stick for various reasons which i will not go into at length lesbianism being an issue here phoebe ditzy and blonde yet with a deep and mysterious quality chandler the underdog with the highly developed sense of sarcastic humour which is the province of only the most maligned joey sweet and dumb but with a golden heart and then theres rachel the spoilt brat turned girlabouttown who never really realises that what shes always wanted is right in front of her i am not going to deny that there are flaws in friends the sentimental scenes do have more than a tinge of saccharine to them i personally cannot watch the final episode without cringing and sometimes the storyline wavers a little but the comedy note here the comedy which is as it should be the essence of the show remains intact always people are always ready to critise friends for one thing or another but the truth is and this is backed up by the skyhigh ratings that friends does everything a sitcom should do and its damn funny with it thank god for dvds and reruns,POSITIVE

With romance and stories that compels anyone (even teenage boys), and classic lines such as, ""And you never knew she was a lesbian?"" (pilot episode).

At the end of the day, Friends is a story-driven sitcom. Each character brings something compelling as well as humor and reoccurring jokes (such as Monica's clean obsession). Yet, each brings something different. Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, Pheobe, and Joey all combine to create a diverse group of interesting and diverse characters, yet a group dynamic. As different as they all are, you never get the sense that they make an odd group. They all have ties and ultimately, they all love each other.

1255,1255,10.0,9 December 2015,"The Iconic Sitcom which pretty much 'Singlehandedly', If you leave Seinfeld out of the scene, (Although the two shows serve in an entirely different perspective) defined the television comedy landscape through the entire course of its 10 year run, stretching from the mid 90s to the early 2000s. Besides receiving numerous awards, earning Millions and making Multi- millionaire cast members,, the show established itself as the classic blueprint for various subsequent character- driven sitcoms. Just as the spirit of the 'The Simpsons' runs through every adult animated sitcom, so too does the spectre of Friends continue to hang over most of today's mainstream sitcoms.

'Friends' was an incredibly funny show for most of its run. It felt fresh not because of its approach to comedy but because it featured relatively novel and moderately idiosyncratic characters played by wonderful actors. It also connected with a lot of late-teens and 20- somethings who took vicarious pleasure in a show featuring a set-up they could relate to. As Marta Kauffman, the show's co-creator succinctly put it recently, 'Friends' ""was about that time in your life when your friends are your family"".

Lastly Who could forget the ever changing concept of flirting with the catchiest, cheesiest or dumbest yet sweetest pickup lines that the sitcom gifted us with; though Joey Tribbiani stands out here,""How You Do'n?"" The most famous line from FRIENDS. As a matter of fact, I bet You'd find it extremely hard if you try to find A guy in the Late 90's or early 00's who hasn't tried it at least once!

1302,1302,9.0,27 September 2019,"I've been a fan of Friends since it first ran on TV. I had most of it on VHS, then got the DVD-box, and now just a week ago the Bluray-box.

I've been watching it from the start, aiming to go through the whole series again. It's probably been a decade and a half since I saw it last. I love this show, I really do. There are a few episodes that feel kind of throwaway, but most are solid entertainment, and quite a few are really - REALLY - good! My absolute favourite character is Chandler, but Joey and Phoebe aren't far behind. Monica is kind of a 50/50 thing for me...

But Ross and Rachel, sadly, are what keeps this show from being a 10 for me. Ross is an annoying moper at first, then rolls over into obsessed and creepy, and somewhere right before the end of the series (where they try to take him back to ""normal"", but it's too late) he just seem like a mentally disturbed sociopath. Combine this with his weird love for Rachel, the most manipulative and psychpathically indecisive sitcom character ever, and the two of them keep Friends from top spot.

I still love the show, and I'll still watch it every now and again. But if I can I'll skip over the Ross&Rachel heavy episodes.

Word of warning for anyone thinking of buying this on dvd - DON'T! The remastering on the DVD's is nonexistant! The picture is grainy and blurry and pretty much awful!

1312,1312,10.0,17 May 2024,"There are many great sitcoms on American TV. Although they are often seen as the same, each has their own style. FRIENDS is the best sitcom with a soap opera atmosphere ever written.

The episodes are light, fun, the jokes flow naturally according to the situation, sometimes the laughing track is overdone, but it gives the audience a sense of well-being. Unlike other comedies, such as Seinfeld, the dramas and romances are essential parts of the programme, with the protagonists living out small soap opera arcs (pregnancy, divorce, adoption, etc.). The fact that none of the six protagonists have left the series, as is common in several other popular tv shows, is another strong point of FRIENDS that has maintained its cohesion. The opening theme, ""I'll Be There For You"" by The Rembrandts, is a classic that reflects the spirit of the sitcom.

However, the programme has a serious diversity problem, with hardly any black or asian actors throughout its ten seasons. In the first two seasons, Ross (David Schwimmer) gets a pet monkey. Having a pet monkey is forbidden in many places, the situation even becomes a joke in one strange episode. The producers' aim was to make the series more family-friendly. Today it seems awkward. Once they got rid of the monkey, FRIENDS got a lot better. In the first few seasons, the focus was on the characters Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), and it took a while to achieve a healthy balance between the actors.

Some situations aren't believable, like the episode in which Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) thinks her mother has reincarnated into a cat or when a saleswoman goes to Ross's (David Schwimmer) apartment to ask him out. But in general, the situations are realistic, especially between the third and seventh seasons. Friends could also be accused of being too Americanised, with many references to characters from American culture, which is understandable given that it was a series shown on free-to-air television in the United States.

The episode ""The One Where No One's Ready"" is the peak of FRIENDS, as it contains all the elements mentioned, a well-integrated cast, good jokes and balance in the scenes between the actors.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",there are many great sitcoms on american tv although they are often seen as the same each has their own style friends is the best sitcom with a soap opera atmosphere ever written the episodes are light fun the jokes flow naturally according to the situation sometimes the laughing track is overdone but it gives the audience a sense of wellbeing unlike other comedies such as seinfeld the dramas and romances are essential parts of the programme with the protagonists living out small soap opera arcs pregnancy divorce adoption etc the fact that none of the six protagonists have left the series as is common in several other popular tv shows is another strong point of friends that has maintained its cohesion the opening theme ill be there for you by the rembrandts is a classic that reflects the spirit of the sitcom however the programme has a serious diversity problem with hardly any black or asian actors throughout its ten seasons in the first two seasons ross david schwimmer gets a pet monkey having a pet monkey is forbidden in many places the situation even becomes a joke in one strange episode the producers aim was to make the series more familyfriendly today it seems awkward once they got rid of the monkey friends got a lot better in the first few seasons the focus was on the characters ross david schwimmer and rachel jennifer aniston and it took a while to achieve a healthy balance between the actors some situations arent believable like the episode in which phoebe lisa kudrow thinks her mother has reincarnated into a cat or when a saleswoman goes to rosss david schwimmer apartment to ask him out but in general the situations are realistic especially between the third and seventh seasons friends could also be accused of being too americanised with many references to characters from american culture which is understandable given that it was a series shown on freetoair television in the united states the episode the one where no ones ready is the peak of friends as it contains all the elements mentioned a wellintegrated cast good jokes and balance in the scenes between the actors,POSITIVE

1318,1318,10.0,22 October 1998,"When this sitcom came out, it was original! It was funny! Oh, what a great show it WAS! But now, the writers have lost their grasp on the whole idea of originality. It seems the same kind of thing happens every episode! For example, there was hardly a single episode in the first season when Ross didn't mention his wife being a lesbian, which quickly got boring. Janice's character got so out of control, and when she was brought back we were very lucky that the writers decided to get rid of her very quickly.

Then, there's the much hyped London episode. How could anyone be so disappointed as me, a British person, when he finds that all the hype, plus the fact that many respected British actors were featuring, all this was for nothing! The episode had no funny parts, it was like the writers sat down, thought of a small plot, thought of the ending, and just sat down and wrote a boring, repetitive episode that started boring and ended boring!

All I'm saying, and I know a lot of people disagree with me, but a lot of people agree too, is that the show should stop while it's ""ahead"". The show should have stopped after season three, when it still had a molecule of dignity about it....sorry fans of Friends, but this show is toast!","September 22, 1994 (United States)",when this sitcom came out it was original it was funny oh what a great show it was but now the writers have lost their grasp on the whole idea of originality it seems the same kind of thing happens every episode for example there was hardly a single episode in the first season when ross didnt mention his wife being a lesbian which quickly got boring janices character got so out of control and when she was brought back we were very lucky that the writers decided to get rid of her very quickly then theres the much hyped london episode how could anyone be so disappointed as me a british person when he finds that all the hype plus the fact that many respected british actors were featuring all this was for nothing the episode had no funny parts it was like the writers sat down thought of a small plot thought of the ending and just sat down and wrote a boring repetitive episode that started boring and ended boring all im saying and i know a lot of people disagree with me but a lot of people agree too is that the show should stop while its ahead the show should have stopped after season three when it still had a molecule of dignity about itsorry fans of friends but this show is toast,NEGATIVE

1324,1324,10.0,11 April 2019,"Friends is a show full of whitty humor, fun characters, heartbreaking moments, and awkward situations. From the airing of its first episode in 1994, up to last episode in 2004, writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman found ways to keep audiences captivated, Humor, brilliant set designs and the wildly ordinary lives of Joey, Chandler, Ross, Monica, Phobie, and Rachel are what kept us all watching. Thanks to the creative writing style of Marta Kauffman and David Crane, Friends quickly became a fan favorite. Many of the iconic phrases they used throughout the show fall may somewhere in your vocabulary today. Phrases like, ""we were on a break,"" ""how you doin?"" and worst of all, anything that comes out of Janice's mouth. We can all her her voice now, ""CHANDLER BING,"" and ""Oh. My. Gawwwwwwwd."" Kauffman and Crane were brilliant writers, their ability to adapt and come up with new fresh ideas is what kept Friends alive. The two writers spent a lot of their time during shooting tweaking their writing to the crowds reaction. If they didn't get the reaction they were expecting, Kauffman and Crane would turn to the audience and ask for input. They turned to the cast members, particularly Matthew Perry aka Chandler, for suggestions as well. Many times the those suggestions made it to the final cut of the episode. This was their way of ensuring that everyone was enjoying the show. Kauffman and Crane's writing was fantastic. Their writing however, was not the soul reason Friends was as successful as it was, people like the writers who helped Kauffman and Crane, editing teams, cameramen, light guys, boom operators, and the set teams. These amazing groups of people mad it all happen and brought writing on a paper to a ten season tv show. Just as iconic as the character of Friends are, some of their set pieces are equally as iconic. When thinking of Friends, there are a couple pieces in each set that one might recognize, the orange couch from the coffee house Central Perk, the foosball table in Chandler and Joey's apartment, the picture frame around the the peephole in Rachel and Monica's apartment, and even the bizarre 3D framed picture named Edna that floats around from time to time. These things, along with others you may be thinking of, enhance the aesthetics of the show and draw your attention to the sets and what is happening around the characters. When you see these pieces, you know exactly where the characters are. This, along with good camera work are another reason why Friends, more than ten years later, is still loved by many. But arguably, the best part of the show are the characters. Ross, Joey, Chandler, Monica, Pheoby, and Rachel are 6 iconic names that made Friends into the show it is today. Writers Kauffman and Crane made these characters relatable, friendly, and funny in order to gain fandom amongst all crowds. From the controlling behavior of Monica, to the corky dad like humor of Chandler, everyone has someone they feel they closely relate to. The choice of actors for Friends could not have been any better. With Jennifer Aniston aka Rachel, being the most popular of the bunch, all have been able to go onto different acting jobs and perform very well in various roles. Friends has been off the air for over ten years now, but the humor is not lost on us. We use their language, we recognize their names, and we see their talent.

1337,1337,10.0,22 November 2000,"I have been watching Friends since the third season and after I watched one episode, I was hooked. I immediately started recording all of the episodes and reading anything I could find about it. This show is one of the few exceptions of smart TV. It's funny but not to the point where it becomes silly.

Most if not all of the episodes are absolutely hilarious. When I watch Friends, I actually laugh out loud, which is unusual for me. Perhaps, the thing that I like best is that every week, two or three plots are running at the same time. Any other show, ONE plot is the main focus. Since the cast is made up of six characters, it calls for different situations and I love that. The most ordinary situations/dialogue/problems can be turned into something so complicated. And that's what makes it so funny.

Friends is a well written show that doesn't get out of control with its stupidity. At some times, the annoying laughter from the audience at the dumbest things makes me so mad.

The one downfall of the show is the constant change of wardrobe with the cast. (Specifically with the ladies.) I can't say that I've ever seen an outfit worn twice.

Even though the endless wear of dresses and khakis irritates me to no end, I still love the show because of its writing and terrific acting.

1343,1343,1.0,23 December 2023,"I enjoy Friends every time I watch them, but what I especially love is the amazing comedy of David Schwimmer. Ross is for sure not my favorite character nor does he get the best jokes, we all know who that would be, but David makes such a fabulous work with what material he's got, it amazes me time and time again! I just hope he's done enough money for a life time there, because it does feel a little bit like he has given all of his talent to the show.

My second point is actually a bit of a complaint. For the show that big it is weird how many story inconsistencies it has. There wre a lot of examples for it through out the years, but I get especially mad with ep 2 in season 7, where Ross and Monica's parents have these lines:
I remember when we first got engaged... Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant... I still don't know how it happened?

1345,1345,10.0,9 March 2023,"This review is the result of years of sporadic trying to get something from this show. I tried honestly to find something in it, be it funny or warming. Sure, from time to time, a line jumps that would be funny perhaps in another context. But the wannabe soft parts are mushy, the quiproquos would have been easily avoidable through simple clarification, and the immature, childish behavior of all the characters destroys even the rare glimpses of fun, because everything is not life-like at all.

The main characters are not relatable. They are in their late 20s but they act like teens, and they are so sketchy: the spoiled, independent girl, the quirky girl, the competitive girl, the oh-so-funny guy, the shallow stud, and the dorky unrequited lover. Many people appear to like them and the show, maybe as a result of heavy promotion and of the viewers' own shallowness. But even as an escapist show, it doesn't work because it's almost annoyingly unreal.

Others noted its leaning towards dumbing down, because the only character with higher education (Ross) is constantly mocked for it and appears as boring and awkward. To me, paradoxically perhaps, the only almost likeable main characters are sometimes Phoebe and Joey, for their sporadic, down to earth common sense.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",this review is the result of years of sporadic trying to get something from this show i tried honestly to find something in it be it funny or warming sure from time to time a line jumps that would be funny perhaps in another context but the wannabe soft parts are mushy the quiproquos would have been easily avoidable through simple clarification and the immature childish behavior of all the characters destroys even the rare glimpses of fun because everything is not lifelike at all the main characters are not relatable they are in their late s but they act like teens and they are so sketchy the spoiled independent girl the quirky girl the competitive girl the ohsofunny guy the shallow stud and the dorky unrequited lover many people appear to like them and the show maybe as a result of heavy promotion and of the viewers own shallowness but even as an escapist show it doesnt work because its almost annoyingly unreal others noted its leaning towards dumbing down because the only character with higher education ross is constantly mocked for it and appears as boring and awkward to me paradoxically perhaps the only almost likeable main characters are sometimes phoebe and joey for their sporadic down to earth common sense,NEGATIVE

1352,1352,1.0,1 May 2024,"As a lifelong fan of ""Friends,"" it's hard to put into words just how much this show means to me. From the very first episode to the emotional finale, ""Friends"" has been a constant companion, a source of laughter, comfort, and countless unforgettable moments.

What makes ""Friends"" so special is its timeless appeal. No matter how many times I've watched it, the jokes still land perfectly, the characters feel like old friends, and the iconic moments never lose their charm. Whether it's Ross's hilarious ""pivot"" scene, Phoebe's quirky songs, or Chandler's sarcastic wit, each character brings something unique to the table, creating a dynamic and unforgettable ensemble cast.

But beyond the humor, ""Friends"" also excels in its heartfelt portrayal of friendship, love, and the ups and downs of life. The bond between Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe is the heart of the show, and their journey through careers, relationships, and everyday struggles resonates with viewers of all ages.

One of the things I love most about ""Friends"" is its ability to transport me to another time and place. Whether it's the cozy Central Perk coffee shop, Monica's meticulously organized apartment, or the iconic orange couch, the show's setting feels like a warm hug, inviting viewers to escape into its world time and time again.

And of course, I can't talk about ""Friends"" without mentioning its unforgettable theme song, ""I'll Be There for You"" by The Rembrandts. Whenever I hear those opening chords, I can't help but smile and sing along, knowing that I'm about to embark on another adventure with my favorite group of friends.

In conclusion, ""Friends"" isn't just a TV show - it's a cultural phenomenon, a timeless classic that continues to capture the hearts of viewers around the world.

1358,1358,10.0,29 June 2019,"Friends is the best sitcom I have ever seen. I watched all ten seasons multiple times and plan on doing so again in a couple of years.

Here's what's so great about it:

1. Great characters Who wouldn't like to have friends as good and diverse as this? Yes, they're all white. But remember that Friends began at a time when it wasn't considered a neccessity to at least have a black, an asian and a gay character in the same show. I can't imagine a person who can't relate to at least one of the characters.

2. The balance Friends is quite often simple fun, sometimes it's emotional, sometimes it's almost depressingly sad. But somehow the writers always managed to clear the air with a laugh at the right moment.

3. Friends takes its characters seriously. Sure, it makes fun of them as part of the comedy but every character also has its honest, heartfelt moments without seeming forced.

4. The guest stars Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Bruce Willis, Julia Roberts, JCVD, Elle MacPherson, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Danny de Vito... The list goes on.

5. The 'quotability' Me and my friends still use many phrases, jokes and references from Friends in our every day life. Here are just three examples. 'My girlfriend's a lesbian.' 'Joey doesn't share food!!' 'We were on a break!'

6. The writing Although the show went on for 10 seasons, it didn't feel too repetetive. In my opinion they found a good time for the end of the show. Some storylines feel similar but never bore me. I don't know how they did it, but they did.

I subtract 1 point for the laugh track (never understood that...) and some best-off-episodes consisting mostly of funny moments from previous episodes (no-one needs that!)

1359,1359,9.0,21 February 2020,"Hard to imagine more famous tv series than ""Friends"", however, I still stumble upon people that haven't seen a single episode. I believe they just skip it from stubborness, it's quite common to avoid something because of its popularity. Well, I don't recommend to do this.

The whole decade has passed with this wild bunch. So many hilarious and heartbreaking moments revolve around a group of six people. I cannot say that every situation portrayed in the show has real life analog, but they are funny. Not every season was outstanding, but repetition hasn't occurred once. It is completely understandable as no one's life can be a complete comedy.

A quick circle of tribute to the main characters should be done of course. The head of the group for me is Chandler: always sarcastic guy with tons of insecurities keeps an arsenal of jokes to defuse almost every situation - some people should try his methods. Joey - an ultimate foodie, womaniser...basically, Gluttony and Lust with a dumb attitude, but you cannot stop being amused with him. Ross - the most ordinary person of the group is the bridge to the viewer in my opinion, but also is a counterweight to all-fun colleagues. Phoebe - an outlandish friends that is hard to understand, but full of surprises. Rachel is presumably the beauty queen of the group pretty much likes to live easily and play with other people. Monica - the chef to the marrow: always want to be in control and loves perfection. Alone they sound horrible, but the beauty is in the fusion of all those unique differences.

While I was writing all of this, I realized that many moments are way more serious than you might think from the first glance. So my advice is not to give too much thought and simply enjoy the show.

Watching this series reminded that song a lot. The song was written in the early 80s. I don't know if the creators of the show were in any way inspired by that. I am mainly writing this review to mention about this song. The rest you can ignore - the summary is that it's recommended and I don't like the character played by Jennifer Anniston.

About the series itself:

I would have given it a 10 if for not Rachel-Ross's not so believable ending. While I don't like this duo same as the others, the acting was pretty good. Jennifer Anniston was great.

Other casts were also great. It's surprising that none of the male leads didn't have that successful career.

1365,1365,10.0,16 November 2021,"It feels weird rating it so low. Throughout my whole childhood, I used to go out with friends; watched Malcolm, Friends, and some other shows; and then later on played PC games. I used t othink it was a great comedy show, mostly because they used to put it on some TV programs every day. Then I grew up, found out that offensive, dark humor is much more for me, and started watching shows like ""Two and a half men"", and it hit me - I actually didn't like Friends that much, it was just always on TV. It makes you feel comfortable, makes you think of your after teen years, and also makes you not think. People with jobs, in the middle of the day, drinking coffee, not caring about their jobs, being cringey, basically making small talk almost all the time, and occasionally hooking up with each other or with other people. It's the perfect show for one's background, but to sit down, watch it and have a good laugh with quality humor - I don't think so. They had their moments, I laughed my a55 off at some moments. But generally speaking, this is one of the few shows that I've watched its all episodes, yet I never rewatched it and I never will. I do it every other year with Scrubs, Two and a half men, and Futurama, because I cannot put them on the background since these shows keep my interest still.

1406,1406,1.0,9 November 2004,"For a comedy, they added way too much drama, nor was the comedic elements really funny. All the characters just acted like nimrods and talk funny because apparently subtlety isn't amusing to a lot of people. Also, I found it so predictable (wow, Rachel and Ross wound up together. What a freaking surprise) and abusively cliché (how many weddings and babies can one show have?!). To make matters worse, the spin-off is going to be based around the worst of the six - Joey. Ugh! Overrated and over-hyped are words too good to describe this show.

But then again, with the exception of a select few, I think all sitcoms are rubbish.

I also want to say this beats Charmed because Charmed truly sucks, and I don't understand why it's adored like it is. A Buffy rip-off but without the wit, intelligent themes, allegories, and accurate study of human nature (there appears to be no grey area on Charmed as far as I've seen).","September 22, 1994 (United States)",for a comedy they added way too much drama nor was the comedic elements really funny all the characters just acted like nimrods and talk funny because apparently subtlety isnt amusing to a lot of people also i found it so predictable wow rachel and ross wound up together what a freaking surprise and abusively cliché how many weddings and babies can one show have to make matters worse the spinoff is going to be based around the worst of the six joey ugh overrated and overhyped are words too good to describe this show but then again with the exception of a select few i think all sitcoms are rubbish i also want to say this beats charmed because charmed truly sucks and i dont understand why its adored like it is a buffy ripoff but without the wit intelligent themes allegories and accurate study of human nature there appears to be no grey area on charmed as far as ive seen,NEGATIVE

1416,1416,10.0,16 May 2002,"Even my favorite show of all time, ""Seinfeld,"" started to wane out in the final seasons. I think ""Friends"" has reached that point. It's almost time to call it quits. I think the show should go about two more seasons, but that's it. Now, the writers are simply going for cheap techniques to lure in audiences. Can they even call the show ""Friends"" anymore? They're all screwing each other! I never had any friends like these! So let me see, what's the update...Rachel is having Ross's baby, Joey confessed his love for Rachel, Chandler got married to Monica and Ross got married to practically everyone on the show. This is a sitcom, but the writers are treating like it's ""Dynasty"" or ""Dallas."" I think all of them should break up and they should just be FRIENDS again. After all, that's the name of the show.

But to be on the positive side, the show hasn't lost all touch. I still think the show is very funny. The cast still has the energy and chemistry they had when they first started. Chandler has gained back his sarcasm--which is great, because I was getting worried for a while. I still wish Chandler didn't get married to Monica, because he was so much funnier when he was slacking off with Joey, kicking back on the La-Z Boy, drinking beer and watching free porn. His trademark sarcasm was in full swing back then. Then after he became romantically involved with Monica, he became her lapdog and the sarcasm was lost. But recently, his sarcasm has been coming back, which makes me feel proud. Everyone has that sarcastic buddy who constantly makes smart-aleck comments. We all know Chandler. I know Chandler. I am Chandler. I can totally relate to his character; I'm always spewing the sarcastic remarks at exactly the right times. As for Joey...Joey's still Joey and he will always be Joey. I don't always embrace airhead characters on sitcoms--most of the times the writers make those characters stupid-stupid and not stupid-funny--but him and Phoebe are both a hoot and a half. As dim-witted as Joey is, his gags are often witty. I love that line where he says to Ross, ""If homosapiens were in fact HOMOsapiens...is that why they were extinct?"" Ross replies, ""Homosapiens are humans."" Joey says, ""Hey I'm not judging."" David Schwimmer is funny, and sometimes hilarious, as the well-to-do but mildly stuck-up Ross Gellar. As dry as Ross's sense of humor is, he usually cracks me up, even if I'm laughing AT him. Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox top off this great cast, which also includes some memorable recurring actors, like Christina Pickles and Elliott Gould as Ross and Monica's parents. I haven't watched too many of the recent episodes, so I didn't get to check out all the guest appearances on the show, but I did see the episode with Bruce Willis and he was hilarious.

I still like and will support this show for a few more seasons, but Ii still say if you want to see some memorable episodes of ""Friends,"" watch the first couple of seasons on the repeats. I, personally, have seen those episodes thousands of times, so I don't even want to watch a minute of the repeats, but if you haven't seen the show before--do check out the old episodes before the new ones.

1427,1427,10.0,30 May 2005,"Friends is hands down the best sitcom of all time, the main reasons are the chemistry on screen and that they are best friends off screen, which is rare because in most sitcoms, the actors hate each other because one gets overshadowed and has less publicity! even tho friends is like that because of Jennifer Aniston overshadowing Courtney and Lisa, they still stick by each other! lets explore the main characters:

Rachel Green: played by Jennifer Aniston, when we first saw her back in 1994 she was spoilt and was daddy's little girl, but as time went she became independent and into her own after the ""We were on a break"" and when she married Ross and Vegas, we saw that she was over Ross and stood up and said ""we can't stay Married"", she is telling him that its over, this is the main highlight, Rachel standing up for herself. season.since she had her baby thats when we see the true Rachel Green for the first time. Plus shes HOOOTTT!!!!! rating 8/10

Monica Gellar: played by Courtney Cox- Monica is the bitchiest out of all three girls because she gets very competitive and never lets anyone win, especially chandler since they got married, she isn't my favourite character but she does have her moments i.e as fat Monica. rating 7/10

Phoebe Buffay- Played by Lisa Kudrow, Phoebe is the funniest female character hands down, her songs, her wit and her blondness makes her such a brilliant creation to watch, i couldn't imagine anyone playing her, also her twin sister is funny because you can see that they don't get along and after the ""Buffay the Vampire layer"" porn movie incident where Ursula used Phoebes name, you can see why Phoebe hates her.also Lisa portrays Phoebes troubled life with a smile and i think that is what makes Lisa such a great actress. rating 10/10.

Joey Tribbiani: played by Matt Leblanc. Joey is a great character but he is not my favourite because after a while, Joey became a tiresome character and all the other Friends all got married had kids etc but he didn't seem to fit in anymore, i mostly admired the Joey and Chandler relationship, which got built up over the years which is great, they have more chemistry on screen than Chandler has with Monica, because i think that they were closer than he was with Monica. i don't think that his Sitcom will ever be as successful because they main characters bore me, and there is no chemistry on screen.8/10

Chandler Bing: played by Matthew Perry, Chandler the best he really is, my favourite Character because he is always making fun of how slow and dumb Joey is, i grew bored of him when he married Monica because he lost his Witt, Monica kept on being serious all the time and thats when Chandler became serious and thats why i grew bored! but he is still the best! he still does have is moments but Monica took that away and made him more mature which was a big mistake for Chandler Fans.rating 10/10

Ross Gellar: played by David Schimmer. Ross, when Friends started he wasn't the best Character because he was quite boring, but as seasons went on Davids acting and comic timing improved and thats when he became really funny! i liked it when he screamed ""WE WERE ON A BREAK"" after this he became funny, and as his relationship with Rachel ended, thats when he challenged Matthew Perry as the funniest Friend. I'm glad that He and Rachel got back together and i would have liked this as a sitcom than 'JOEY'. 10/10

Friends will always be the best and even tho some episodes are bad and some are excellent, you cant take the chemistry and great acting away from this great sitcom, the best seasons are 3,4,5,6,7 and 10! also I'm looking forward to the movie that has just been announced!

1428,1428,9.0,7 May 2006,"Friends is a series that will never die!! Over ten series we watch the six friends grow and get closer, within that we see several marriages, arguments and make-ups. During the seasons I believe that the episodes went deeper into each friends life and showed us a lot more character, along with that the writers managed to show us a whole new side of comedy.

1429,1429,10.0,11 August 2006,"""Friends"" revolves around the lives of six distinctive, yet unique individuals. Although their lives seem to be typically American, if anyone, anywhere, had the chance to live half as happily as any one of the characters of the show, he could without a doubt consider himself the luckiest person on earth. ""'Friends' gives us hope, hope of a better life"". Although the plot caries the characters throughout numerous troubles and quarrels, the love that the six share allows them to overcome any obstacle and even turn the darkest moments into humor. ""Laughter is the best medicine""  quite true. The only shame is that the person to make up that saying never had a chance to see an episode of 'Friends'. Truly incredible, there is not a single episode out of the 240, which would cause you to fall off your couch, or choke on spaghetti out of laughter. Any person to watch only a few consecutive episodes would inevitably fall in love with all six characters, who play the roles of what have become to be their own personalities. The only and greatest negative remark regarding 'Friends', is that they should have kept the show going. The writers, Marta Kaufman and David Crane, proved they can keep the excitement of the show going for ten years, which means they could have continued it indefinitely, and they should have. The greatest show to ever exist can be hardly considered a compliment.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends revolves around the lives of six distinctive yet unique individuals although their lives seem to be typically american if anyone anywhere had the chance to live half as happily as any one of the characters of the show he could without a doubt consider himself the luckiest person on earth friends gives us hope hope of a better life although the plot caries the characters throughout numerous troubles and quarrels the love that the six share allows them to overcome any obstacle and even turn the darkest moments into humor laughter is the best medicine quite true the only shame is that the person to make up that saying never had a chance to see an episode of friends truly incredible there is not a single episode out of the which would cause you to fall off your couch or choke on spaghetti out of laughter any person to watch only a few consecutive episodes would inevitably fall in love with all six characters who play the roles of what have become to be their own personalities the only and greatest negative remark regarding friends is that they should have kept the show going the writers marta kaufman and david crane proved they can keep the excitement of the show going for ten years which means they could have continued it indefinitely and they should have the greatest show to ever exist can be hardly considered a compliment,POSITIVE
1430,1430,8.0,2 June 2013,"I admit it. I haven't watched a single episode of Friends until two weeks ago. After watching some random episode I thought 'Hey! This ain't so bad', so I decided to give it a try. Now, two weeks later I'm halfway through season 9... I really got drawn into this show. You start to care for those six people like they were family. Each character has his own perks and flaws and that's why you start identifying with them. And with 3 guys and 3 girls there's really enough material to appeal to both men and women.

Even though I love the characters and the comedy, I can't give this show the full 10/10 because, after 7 seasons, plots are starting to repeat themselves, I especially got tired of the whole Ross & Rachel situation after a while. Also this show often contradicts itself. While in the beginning Ross has ""only slept with one women"" (His ex-wife Carol) somewhere in season 6 or 7 Chandler reveals that he slept with some cleaning lady in college which simply is not possible. Stuff like that happens quite a few times and I sometimes get the feeling that the writers forget to watch their own show. Those flaws really do bum me out and keep me from really 100% getting into this show.

Still great, 9/10.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i admit it i havent watched a single episode of friends until two weeks ago after watching some random episode i thought hey this aint so bad so i decided to give it a try now two weeks later im halfway through season i really got drawn into this show you start to care for those six people like they were family each character has his own perks and flaws and thats why you start identifying with them and with guys and girls theres really enough material to appeal to both men and women even though i love the characters and the comedy i cant give this show the full because after seasons plots are starting to repeat themselves i especially got tired of the whole ross rachel situation after a while also this show often contradicts itself while in the beginning ross has only slept with one women his exwife carol somewhere in season or chandler reveals that he slept with some cleaning lady in college which simply is not possible stuff like that happens quite a few times and i sometimes get the feeling that the writers forget to watch their own show those flaws really do bum me out and keep me from really getting into this show still great,POSITIVE

1435,1435,9.0,1 March 2022,"It's important to know that I don't typically write reviews, but after seeing how high this show was rated I had too.

I have watched the entire series and quite honestly I don't know how this series is so highly ranked. To me the shows writing is mediocre perhaps even less than mediocre and the acting is some of the worst I have seen. Of course, there are a few exceptions being Lisa Kudrow and a couple of secondary characters but the rest of the cast is by far some of the worst actors/actresses I have ever seen.

Now for the so called comedy... this is just not funny. By the way sitcom stands for situational comedy therefore there it should be funny. The jokes are basic and lacking in mental stimuli. The laughing in the background makes me wonder if these people were drugged or perhaps the show did not travel well through the time. I suppose I'll never know.

Maybe I am the odd one out but it seems this show is far overrated and just liked by a bunch of people who want to follow the bandwagon.

Sure, one of the most successful and popular comedies ever made but it's no lie that it isn't 100% about quality.

From season 1 to 4 the show is a complete mess with unfunny situations, SNL imitation sequences, and awkward performances.

The show starts to get a unique vibe and special charm since 1999. To be honest, the humor gets more witty and leaves behind cheesy lines for raunchy humor instead; but keeping the typical American humor all the time.

Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston and David Schwimmer shine all the time while the rest of the cast does it very fine and even gain status as people's favorite characters on any sitcom.

The situations are tremendously creative from 1999 on and I can't think of any other show to perfectly manage the facial expressions of it's cast. It's also part of the charm of the comedy; pretty people performing decently even with their faces.

I know, like me, millions of people will be tuning into the series finale in May, with their fingers crossed, praying that Ross and Racheal will end up together, and that all the characters will end up happy in their lives.

Friends has no natural flow, no surprises and no funny jokes.

1478,1478,10.0,8 June 2024,"I never heard anything about the TV show ""Friends"" until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic emerged. During the lockdown, one of my sisters asked me where she could watch ""Friends."" I was curious and asked her why it was fun to watch. She enthusiastically told me that I would love it. Intrigued by her recommendation, I decided to give it a try. Once I started watching, I was hooked. I ended up binge-watching all ten seasons in just one week. The characters, humor, and relatable storylines captivated me. After finishing the series, I found myself watching it again and again, completing the entire series two to three more times. Each time I rewatched it, I discovered new nuances and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The show became a comforting and enjoyable escape during the challenging times of the pandemic.

Originally when I watched when i was younger (around 15) I thought seasons 7-10 were the best as, to me, they were the most relatable, but as I've got older I've grown significantly more fond of the first few seasons of friends. By the end of the show it gets dry, however it may still be funny at moments, the characters draw out to be so hyperbolic they are no longer relatable and it is clear they ran out of ideas for the show. When you watch the first few seasons it's filled with humor and lovable relatable characters. I think Joey gets treated the worst by the end, although Joey was not particularly known for his intelligence in the early seasons, he wasn't so over the top obnoxiously dumb like they make him by the end of the show.

I consider David Schwimmer being one of the best sitcom actors ever, along with Jason Alexander from Seinfeld. Although their characters were sometimes a bit annoying and too whining.

Of course, reviewing a show 20 years after its final episode is always tricky. People not only have different tastes, the social taste even changes over time.

1500,1500,10.0,19 January 2022,"Well, can anyone really not love such a great series?! In my opinion, this is one of the most amazing series - great director's work, great acting, great humor, everything is great! I think that for everyone who loves 'Friends', all the characters have long become family. Phoebe is a charmingly crazy, out-of-this-world girl, an animal rights activist who believes that in her previous life she was a nurse and her arm was torn off in the war. Only Phoebe can believe that the soul of her late mother now lives in a cat! Monica is beautiful, clever, witty, funny and ... well, just turned on purity! Only Monica, because of revenge on Chandler, could once 'chop off' a piece of his toe. Rachel is the pride of her dad! A beauty who has made an excellent career from waitress to boss! Sometimes she behaves like an adult sensible person, sometimes - like a true child! Rachel sobs on the day of her own thirtieth birthday, believing that youth is gone. Joe is a handsome, charming, cute, funny and narrow-minded actor. But it is his 'narrow-mindedness' that makes him so beautiful, charming, cute, funny. And his phrase 'How do you doin'?' entered the fund of the best replicas of the series! Chandler - unlike, perhaps, Joe, he is not funny, but insanely witty! This guy laughs at his own even the stupidest jokes and dances absolutely amazing! Chandler is absolutely the most charming friend living next door, who has huge problems communicating with the opposite sex, as long as he does not 'meet' Monica... Ross is a cute-cute-cute botanist, or rather a paleontologist (although who is easier from this?!). Although Ross is to some extent even a scientist, he is still absolutely crazy. But his craziness makes me smile just when I look at him! Ross is the main married friend. Despite the fact that he was divorced all 3 times, he gives advice to friends on how to build a family life correctly! Only Ross can wear a tie with dragons on an important evening for him! Without at least one of these friends, perhaps the series itself would have lost its zest! Finally, I want to say that 'Friends' has been going on and off for 10 years, and during all this time the series has not lost its popularity. Even the notorious off-screen laughter for so many years did not annoy me at all!

One of my female friends (who I had a crush on at the time) lent my a video of the start of the first series. That summer I ended up watching 2 series every 3 days, laughing my way through the lot, and within a week I was finally up to the current episodes. Since then I've been addicted. Buying the DVDs at a premium the day they came out, putting them on every birthday and Christmas list, and then putting them on as my night time watching, something regular, something to fall asleep to.

Then I realised about a year or two ago, I hadn't really laughed at a Friends episode for a long long time. But I kept watching. Why, because Friends is more than just the laughs, more than just the misadventures of each episode. The whole of the series and complete friends is so much more than just the sum of its parts.

You start to see a decrease in quality. Not sure how much money had to do with it, but I noticed that half the scenes only had two of the characters in it, like it was too expensive to have everyone on screen for the whole episode. Also, they introduced the worst and most forced storyline of the entire series... a new love story between 2 characters that never showed it before. The previous seasons went away from the drama and were jam-packed with jokes, but seems like they decided they needed to go back to drama. I almost gave this season a 6/10 because some episodes were hard to watch, but it finished strong, and also has my favorite episode of the series, the one with Brad Pitt.

A step up from last season but laughs are less plentiful than the early seasons and they continue with some forced drama. Still enjoyable.

1555,1555,10.0,18 February 2019,"I usually don't like to be mean about shows or movies, I'm pretty much ok with the idea that everybody likes different stuff, live and let live. However, when I feel that there has been serious misjustice done in the world of comedy/humor, I can't stay silent. The very reputation of the words ""funny"", ""comedy"", ""humor"", and ""hilarious"" has been irreparably damaged by shows like this. There are many shows, presently and in the past, that have done this, but they were usually very easily identified and correctly put in their place in the ol' 'sub-par' category. However, after seeing the rating this show has received, I felt it was my duty to dispel the ridiculous rating of 8.9 (as of 2/17/19) and one should not be deceived by such numbers.

Ok, 'Friends': This is a show for people with a bland, generic, tame, underdeveloped and/or a non-existent sense of humor who want to feel like they're normal people that have a good sense of humor. But alas, it may be genetic, or it may be environmental, but there is simply a large segment of the population that are incapable of distinguising what is genuinely funny. It's not their fault. They can't change. It's too late. But we don't want to make them sad, or feel left out, so that's the reason shows like this one are created.

This show labels itself a sitcom, but it seems that it couldn't make up its mind on whether to be a sitcom, a dramedy, or a soap opera for teenagers/early 20-somethings. But I understand why it has this identity crisis. If you're catering to the audience I described in the previous paragraph, you know that, because of their underdeveloped sense of humor, they would not be able to keep their attention on the show if it was more strictly comedy/humor-driven with maybe a drop of drama/sentimentality here and there (think along the lines of 'The King of Queens'), so big batches of non-comedy time needed to be dumped into to 'Friends'. The range of humor these people get is so limited that the show couldn't expect to fill more than 10 minutes of comedy, and they had to keep them tuned in for the whole 22 minutes of airtime, so this is where the terrible (or ""amazing"" to Friends fans) filler came in.

If you think all that sounds appealing, or you know you're in the demographic of being humor-deficient, then by all means, watch 'Friends', you will love and enjoy it. There's nothing wrong with that, that's what it's there for, people like youself. But to those reading this that like to laugh at things that are actually funny, and enjoy the many facets and types of comedy in the world, I urge you not to watch this show, as chunks of your sense of humor may wither and die if subjected to 'Friends' in any amount.

FYI: I don't like to rate things 1 star, because it kinda makes me feel sad. So I had to come up with reasons to give this tv show 2 starts. The reasons I came up with are, as follows: 1.) Courteney Cox gets a lot of cool points in my book because she was in Bruce Springsteen's video for 'Dancing In The Dark'. And she's hot. 2.) Lisa Kudrow was in an episode of a truly funny show ('Cheers') and she had black hair in it and she was sexy with black hair. Ok, 2 stars justified now.

1558,1558,10.0,23 September 2005,"Friends, in my opinion is the best television show ever and i was devastated when it ended after the tenth series. All of the actors portray unique and incredibly funny characters, and manage to keep the atmosphere and character relation throughout the whole ten years.

A review that i just read on the main page of Friends claims that their favorite are in this order: Chandler(Perry), Ross(schwimmer), Phoebe(Kudrow), Monica(Cox-Arquette), Rachel(Aniston) and lastly Joey(LeBlanc). This could not be more off. My favorite characters in order from worst to best: Ross: The only character that i HATE. He has very little funny lines and does not bring the atmosphere to the show that the other characters/actors do. He is geeky and annoying and takes ten minutes to get out one sentence. Also, the fact that the character(nothing to do with the actor at all) always tries to get Rachel, and cheats on her, and wants her again, and then marries another woman, and then wants her again etc. I find Ross to be a pointless and pathetic character, probably only added into the show to have an even mix of Male/Female characters.

Phoebe: Even though Phoebe is my fifth favorite, she is a very good character. Phoebe is the ditzy one that believes in Fate and spirits. Phoebe is very strange, and while seemingly innocent, can be very dirty at times. She delivers many funny moments and adds to the show.

Joey: Joey is an Italian from Queens who is an actor, though usually out of work or in dead end plays. Joey's incredible stupidity also adds to the show. He is also the ladies man and tough guy of the show, his lack of intimate feelings being the focus of many of the plot points about Joey.

Chandler: Chandler is also a great character. All of his one liners make up the best part of the show, but he just gets a tiny bit annoying. Chandler's parents divorced before he was 12, which gave him some psychological problems. Luckily for viewers, these problems bring humour. Chandler is a great character who is acted well by MAtthew Perry.

Monica: Monica is the skinny, competitive, prissy and perfect one. Monica is a chef and she strives for excellence in everything and will never give up a fight. Even though she wins at virtually everything, her parents have always favoured Ross over her, which also adds humour.

Rachel: Rachel is my favorite character in the show, simply because she is the uptown spoiled one. When Rachel first moves to Manhattan after running out on her wedding, she still uses her parents credit cards and has never had a job. She is witty and funny and brings A lot to the show. The only drawback of RAchel is that she falls in love with disgusting Ross, which is a real shame.

Ross and Rachel's relationship is the main idea of the show, but along the way they started to pair them up: Monica and Chandler, Rachel and Joey for a short period of time and of course Phoebe and Mike. The show presents the life of six young friends that live in New York, their relationships with each-other and with others, their jobs, etc. Ross is a paleontologist, divorced from a lesbian that carried his child, the romantic of the group. He had a crush on Rachel since high-school and they started going out in the second season. Rachel is a spoiled, cute girl that moved to NY to start a new life and meet her soul-mate, which turns out to be Ross. Monica is a chef at a local restaurant, Ross' sister and Chandler's wife in the last seasons. She is obsessed by having things clean and she likes to boss people around. Phoebe is a weird, but cool girl that used to be Monica's room-mate before Rachel moved to NY. Chandler uses humor as a way to push people away, like a defense mechanism. He and Ross used to be room-mates in college. Joey, Chandler's room-mate, is a funny Italian actor that came from a big family. He is the macho of the group with a lot of success at women, but also a very caring person. When I think of Friends I think of: ""Heey, how you doin'?"", ""WE WERE ON A BREAK!"", Ross always getting divorced, Phoebe's triplets, Chandler's jokes and Joey who is a littler slower than the rest of them. I remember a joke with Ross and Joey that I really like. Joey goes like this: ""Hey Ross, I've got a science question! If the homo-sapience were in fact HOMO-sapience... is that why they're extinct?"" Ross says: ""Joey, homo-sapience are people."" and then Joey says this killer line: ""Hey, I'm not judging!"". Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox are perfect for their parts, it's like the director chose the actors first and then made-up the characters that suited them better.

1574,1574,2.0,22 August 2012,"Friends was a massive TV show back in the late 90's and early 00's and is still regarded to this date as being one of the best TV shows ever created. It follows 6 friends and their lives living in Manhattan.

I'm young. And so, this show isn't so big anymore. But I still managed to watch every episode of every season and I must admit - I love it. The characters are great and are well acted by each. The story lines are very good and the jokes are hilarious.

I think the mid-seasons are the best, as they give Ross more funny episodes and the laugh track is used less. If I have one complaint it's this - The laugh track is used a bit too often. - A lot of the jokes are funny but not every little thing they say. However, they stopped using it so much as the seasons went on.

Each episode is interesting and they created characters we all love and are somewhat different.

1575,1575,10.0,16 February 2024,"I like it. I hate it. I don't know. I used to love this sitcom when I was a kid. I was obsessed. I was too young to realize how some of the jokes are mediocre or not funny at all. Sometimes, I feel like kids could have written some of the show. Maybe it just grew on me or I grew out of it. I don't know why it's still very popular after all these years. I know the cast too well. That's not the bad part. I like the cast. It's just the show itself. They just sit around and goof off most of the time. Many of the jokes don't make sense. If the main characters explained many of their contradictory subjects and jokes a little bit better to each other or something afterwards, maybe the show would make more sense. Sometimes, they complain and fight about the dumbest things. They also seem to yell a lot at each other. It's really annoying. They just sound childish or aggressive.

There aren't that many interesting situations. If there's a death, they are all just depressed about it. They don't find it mysterious like other stories do. Usually, the problems are as simple as ""I lost my coat"" or something. If the problem is, ""They may get back together"", the take on that isn't very strong. The characters don't support that enough. They just question and wait. Also, I get that they are supposed to make the situations seem real, but every time there's a fight, the characters can seem immature. You don't even get to see how some of their problems get resolved (at least not in the best ways or the best times). The timing in a lot of the show is just bad.

1581,1581,10.0,5 May 2006,"Friends is a juggernaut of a television show. A king of the comedy world. An award winning sitcom that also won millions of hearts during its lifespan.

It portrays the lives and loves of six inseparable friends, three guys and three girls. Starting in 1994 and ending no less than a decade after, the show saw its core characters go from strength to strength. Personally, i think the roots of the shows massive success are the writing, and the six main actors themselves. The relationships between the characters grow and develop over long periods of time, so effective and endearing is the writing here that it's almost like: ""Hey there are some actual people stuck in this television set, oh my god get them out!""

Don't believe me? Friends was and is so popular that in its first two seasons it boasted celebrity guests such as George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Ben Stiller etc.. as well as Brad Pitt and Danny Devito in its last season. It really does hit the spot every time. Basically if you like having friends, then you will love this show. If you don't, then you will probably still love this show..

Friends is unique. It features six of the most lovable flawed characters that you could hope to meet. They each have endearing characteristics and hilarious quirks. From series one, the scriptwriters had molded their characters perfectly, and none of them swayed from how we knew them.

Each show had at least two themes running through it. Each character had their starring moments. The jokes and laughs were shared out equally among the cast. I can't recall a single episode that fell short in any way. Even the secondary characters that appeared in just a few episodes were wonderful - the Janice character popped up at least once in every series and was a great addition to the slick team. Ross & Monica's parents were funny, as was Phoebe's brother. It's kinda wrong to pick out a favorite character from the main six as they were all great in their own way.

Every screenwriter in this genre would love to be able to create a 'Friends' - but it requires more than one great writer - you need a great team of writers to keep the standards high.

1599,1599,1.0,25 May 2006,"it's basically understandable and welcomed even in china mainland, by those who are not good in English and live in a totally different background, mainly wade through the lines and dialogues by Chinese captions (unfortunately, most likely it's translated by some idiots from hong kong, full of stupid mistakes, like translate ""massage"" as ""message"", or ""straight"" (sex) as ""something not bent"", probably make Chinese who totally depend on the caption be confused with American humor).

what i want to emphasize is, even if with so many obstacles, it makes Chinese laugh! my favorite is chandler, i wonder how can he figure out those witty jokes always immediately, you know, those are not meaningless trashes but always to the point and avoid awkward or stressful atmospheres. CHANDLER IS THE KEY OF THIS COMEDY. other four people except monica perform very well too.

my only disappointment is monica, she's old and appearencely not suitable for playing ross's once fat younger sister and chandler's wife (the two actors are respectively two and three of her junior). more importantly, i don't think her performance is funny at all, especially when she was teased in restaurant kitchen by hostile kitchen staff, and she toasted at her parents' anniversary, i felt sorry for her but not funny. her action is formulaized: yell at people while twist her body and arms, staring with blank eyes, that can fit any lines, or maybe none. like joey's Australian girlfriend in one episode said: she's loud for such a small person, and i think she's annoying too.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",its basically understandable and welcomed even in china mainland by those who are not good in english and live in a totally different background mainly wade through the lines and dialogues by chinese captions unfortunately most likely its translated by some idiots from hong kong full of stupid mistakes like translate massage as message or straight sex as something not bent probably make chinese who totally depend on the caption be confused with american humor what i want to emphasize is even if with so many obstacles it makes chinese laugh my favorite is chandler i wonder how can he figure out those witty jokes always immediately you know those are not meaningless trashes but always to the point and avoid awkward or stressful atmospheres chandler is the key of this comedy other four people except monica perform very well too my only disappointment is monica shes old and appearencely not suitable for playing rosss once fat younger sister and chandlers wife the two actors are respectively two and three of her junior more importantly i dont think her performance is funny at all especially when she was teased in restaurant kitchen by hostile kitchen staff and she toasted at her parents anniversary i felt sorry for her but not funny her action is formulaized yell at people while twist her body and arms staring with blank eyes that can fit any lines or maybe none like joeys australian girlfriend in one episode said shes loud for such a small person and i think shes annoying too,NEGATIVE

There is not a single episode in their 10 seasons that's not funny. It's so amazing how the creators and writers made each friend with a distinct character. And how they evolve through those characteristics through 10 long seasons. I have watched most of highly rated comedy shows, but I have never laughed as hard as watching Friends. And I know I never will. Maybe because Friends set the bar too high. Friends was a show out of this world.

1602,1602,10.0,15 May 2024,"""Friends"" has long been cherished for its humor, heart, and the deep connections between its six main characters. Over ten seasons, the series delivered countless laughs and poignant moments, making it a cornerstone of television comedy. However, as a dedicated fan, I feel compelled to voice my strong disapproval and emotional hurt over a particular storyline that deeply undermined the show's legacy.

The romantic involvement between Joey and Rachel in the latter part of the series is not only a glaring misstep but an outright betrayal of the characters and the fans. Ross and Rachel were always portrayed as soulmates, their tumultuous relationship serving as a central, beloved thread throughout the series. To see Joey and Rachel have a romantic affair was nothing short of a violation of his character's integrity and the trust of the audience.

This storyline was not only unnecessary but also deeply insensitive. It felt as though the writers completely disregarded the emotional investment that fans had in Ross and Rachel's relationship. The idea that Joey, a character depicted as a loyal and caring friend, would act in such a way is not just implausible but offensive. It suggests that friendships cannot be trusted and that betrayal is inevitable, which is a damaging message to send.

I am genuinely upset and emotionally damaged by this turn of events. It's shocking and disheartening that the creators chose to pursue such a controversial and hurtful storyline. The decision to depict Joey and Rachel's affair reflects a lack of sensitivity and understanding of the fanbase's emotional connection to the characters. It's a glaring miscalculation that left many fans feeling betrayed and disillusioned.

""Friends"" will always hold a special place in my heart, but this particular plot twist has cast a long shadow over an otherwise exceptional series. It's a reminder that even the best shows can falter when they lose sight of what made them special. The creators should have explored different, more respectful storylines that honored the characters and the fans' emotional investment.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends has long been cherished for its humor heart and the deep connections between its six main characters over ten seasons the series delivered countless laughs and poignant moments making it a cornerstone of television comedy however as a dedicated fan i feel compelled to voice my strong disapproval and emotional hurt over a particular storyline that deeply undermined the shows legacy the romantic involvement between joey and rachel in the latter part of the series is not only a glaring misstep but an outright betrayal of the characters and the fans ross and rachel were always portrayed as soulmates their tumultuous relationship serving as a central beloved thread throughout the series to see joey and rachel have a romantic affair was nothing short of a violation of his characters integrity and the trust of the audience this storyline was not only unnecessary but also deeply insensitive it felt as though the writers completely disregarded the emotional investment that fans had in ross and rachels relationship the idea that joey a character depicted as a loyal and caring friend would act in such a way is not just implausible but offensive it suggests that friendships cannot be trusted and that betrayal is inevitable which is a damaging message to send i am genuinely upset and emotionally damaged by this turn of events its shocking and disheartening that the creators chose to pursue such a controversial and hurtful storyline the decision to depict joey and rachels affair reflects a lack of sensitivity and understanding of the fanbases emotional connection to the characters its a glaring miscalculation that left many fans feeling betrayed and disillusioned friends will always hold a special place in my heart but this particular plot twist has cast a long shadow over an otherwise exceptional series its a reminder that even the best shows can falter when they lose sight of what made them special the creators should have explored different more respectful storylines that honored the characters and the fans emotional investment,NEGATIVE

The people who created Friends have a special gift, otherwise this show wouldn't be so damn funny and so successful. And with 'people' I do not only mean David Crane and Marta Kauffman. I'm not saying that without Jennifer Aniston, Courteny Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer this show would suck but I think it would be less funny. And that's because these actors make the Friends characters alive in such a fun way that EVERY episode I laugh my ass off... Even after 15 times I've seen all ten series. But we shouldn't forget the writers of course! 'Cause, and that's a sure thing, without them this show WOULD've sucked. The dialogues they write are hilarious and, yes I'll say it again, make me laugh at EVERY episode! Even when I'm not watching the show they make me laugh when I'm paying a picture in my head.

1612,1612,3.0,20 November 2015,"I realized that one of the closest things to my heart is going to end forever, six episodes before the last. So much so that despite being a contained person as myself, I began posting constant whatsapp statuses about it, talking to all my friends everywhere, how it was all going to be over for me, forever.

Then came the second last episode, two days later. After watching that episode, I couldn't bear to watch the last one. Not just because all of it was going to get over, but also because the way it was supposedly going to get over. I knew Ross and Rachel would end up together, but Monica's house would be gone. The group won't be hanging out any more. At least not as often as they used to. Everyone was getting settled in their life.

I had come to terms with the fact that it was going to end. But this way? I can't even imagine them beyond the series? When Harry Potter series ended, it was devastating for me. But at least it ended on a note that gave me the thread to extend it post the ending. To imagine how their daily lives might be like. The second last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S, however, made me immensely sad.

Two days later, I shut my room and saw the last episode of F.R.I.E.N.D.S. It was the best ending ever.

I will tell you how. I will avoid the spoilers. Those who know the ending, know how perfect it is, despite all the fears that accumulate on watching the second last. Apart from that, I cherish the fact that now they are a part of my life. Now I have the chance to re-run the whole series (which I am doing currently) and watch it from the perspective of different characters and I must tell you, it is just as funny and light hearted as it was when I watched it for the first time.

It won't be a hyperbole to call F.R.I.E.N.D.S a classic. It is, hands down, the most famous series ever made. 21 years post it's pilot, people are still watching it and enjoying it more than the current running series. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the scale. The quality of other series are measured in comparison to it's standard.

Despite it's yesteryear limitations of technology (they were using flip mobile phones in their last season!), guest roles that would hardly excite the current generation, the storyline, theme and dialogues of the series are so timeless that they have achieved eternity. And so you still find Taylor Swift, Adele and many other major artists talking about watching the series, like it were something still being telecast for the first time. Just likes it's eternity making it cut through generations, it is a series which, no matter how many times you watch it, will make you feel the same way it did for the first time.

1613,1613,2.0,31 May 2007,"It's one of the simplest ideas for a show- just 6 friends who share their lives together. But that is part of what makes it so wonderful. The 6 friends and actors have such a great understanding and connection with each other, it makes YOU want to be their friends. All 6 of them: Chandler, Joey, Monica, Pheobe, Rachel, and Ross, have their own personalities but yet still have that bond with each other. And also, because of the personalities being so diverse, it is quite funny.

Chandler: I know he is usually the favorite of everyone, and yes, he is my favorite, probably since I can relate to him the most. I certainly use sarcasm a lot and see his point of view most of the time.

Joey: He is the most childish out of the 6 but that's what you grow to love about him. Sure, he makes some dumb mistakes, I'm not gonna lie, but there's still a certain cuteness about him you can't deny.

Monica: I relate to Monica quite a bit too, from her competitiveness, to her OCD cleanliness everything has to be perfect. Sometimes that works in her favor and other times, not so much.

Pheobe: While she can be completely blonde at some times (No offense meant, I am blonde as well) she is most-likely the one who's the most wise out of all of them. Having grown up on the streets she isn't afraid to defend herself, yet is such a caring and gentle person.

Rachel: I find her to be the most annoying mainly because of how selfish she can be but there are times where I agree with her 100%. And she DID make it without her father's help.

Ross: He can be whinny and needy however, there's still something about him that you can't quite place but that makes you want to see what he'll do next.

It would be unrealistic if they didn't change at all. I would say however that they should finish it soon.

The chemistry that these actors share is incredible, and the writing is absolutely spectacular. Rarely have I seen a sitcom that is willing to add deep, personal story lines for their characters. Friends had that special something, that ""X"" factor. They were able to get away with just about anything, one second you are hearing joke after joke, and the next you are seeing the actors break out in tears over some big news.

1628,1628,4.0,29 June 2008,"I regret having watched all the 10 seasons of Friends in a span of 8 months when the truth is it should be in a span of 10 years. The regret is purely due to all the pleasure I immensely enjoyed during this period. I and my brothers saw nothing else but Friends. We discussed nothing else but friends. Summarizing this 8 month period of bliss we lived, laughed, lamented with Friends. If you have continuously watched 8 episodes without an eye blink you'll understand the level of obsession I went through.

If I pick my favorite character of the 6, it'll be criminal injustice on my part since I enjoyed and loved each character with all my heart.

Ross's the geeky dinosaur lover. I just loved the turmoil of heartbreaks he goes through with Rachel. As a doting brother of Monica, their affection towards each other is exemplary. Lesbian wife, English wife, Rachel as wife- All ending in divorces. Doting Father of Ben and Emma.

Chandler Bing, oh I just love this guy's sense of humor. To be able to find a joke in all situations does make him the Funny man of the group. As Monica's Husband, could there be a lovelier pair. They were a perfect couple in happiness and hardship. Chandler-Joey friendship and attachment is soul stirring. They are exactly how I wish to feel in midst of my friends. Oh My God!!! Joey  Howyou doin?- the line that makes girls fall for him. His characterization of a aspiring actor. He is exact opposite of Ross (know it all)  know it none. But he is the favorite of the other 5. They all care for him and his success. Loves Sandwiches and Sex. The part he falls in love with Rachel was incredible.

Rachel the star performer of the show rises from a rich spoilt kid to a wonderful mother. I can't imagine her in any other role other than the character she portrayed in Friends. Ross's dream girl, Monica's best friend.

Monica the Chef, the Obsessive cleaning disorder, the obsessively organized military regime following lady.

Phebe Buffe, the street raised lady. Her view of life is simply out of the world. She is completely wild. Such a misfit ting fit of the group. The awesome acting as pregnant women when she was really pregnant deserver's a standing ovation.

1670,1670,8.65,10 August 2024,"Friends is not just a TV show; it's an enduring phenomenon that has captured hearts around the world for decades. From its witty dialogue to its heartfelt moments, the series remains a quintessential comfort show, blending humor and emotion in a way that continues to resonate with audiences.

At the core of Friends are its exceptional performances by the main cast. Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green transformed from a spoiled shop girl to a successful businesswoman, bringing depth and charm to her character. Courteney Cox's Monica Geller, with her obsessive-compulsive tendencies and nurturing spirit, offered a perfect balance of comedy and warmth. Lisa Kudrow's Phoebe Buffay was a quirky breath of fresh air, her offbeat humor and unique outlook on life adding a special flavor to the ensemble.

Matthew Perry, who portrayed Chandler Bing, was a master of delivering sarcastic quips and emotional depth in equal measure. His portrayal of Chandler's insecurities and growth was both hilarious and touching, making his untimely passing a profound loss to fans and the entertainment world.

Matt LeBlanc as Joey Tribbiani brought an endearing and comedic innocence to the group. His portrayal of a lovable but dim-witted aspiring actor was both hilarious and heartwarming. And David Schwimmer's Ross Geller, with his nerdy charm and complex romantic entanglements, provided a perfect foil to his friends' antics while anchoring the group with his earnestness.

The guest stars on Friends further elevate the show's legacy. Brad Pitt's memorable cameo as Will Colbert, a high school rival with a grudge against Rachel, brought both humor and star power. Christina Applegate's portrayal of Rachel's sister, Amy, was a delightful addition, infusing her character with a comedic edge. Reese Witherspoon's appearance as Rachel's other sister, Jill, added a charming and dynamic presence to the show. Bruce Willis's guest role as Paul Stevens, the father of Ross's girlfriend, brought a surprising blend of drama and comedy, showcasing his impressive range.

Beyond the stellar performances and memorable guest stars, Friends is celebrated for its remarkable storylines. The show deftly navigates the complexities of friendships, relationships, and personal growth. Whether it's the will-they-won't-they tension between Ross and Rachel, Monica and Chandler's journey from friendship to parenthood, or the hilarious escapades and heartfelt moments shared by the entire group, Friends manages to capture the essence of human connection in a way that feels both universal and deeply personal.

In summary, Friends is a timeless comfort show that excels in every aspect. Its excellent performances, unforgettable guest stars, and amazing storylines come together to create a series that continues to bring joy, laughter, and comfort to viewers around the world.

1682,1682,8.65,2 April 2012,"I did not just watch a TV series for fun although it was really fun, I also lived with ""friends"" and I did learn so much. I'm not the same person before ""friends"". You can barely find something that makes you laugh in the meantime teaches you. Watching friend you get everything you want, laughing, crying, learning, annoying, sadness, happiness

I'm young and I still haven't had sex, but I think now after finishing friends I know a lot about it and I think it will help me handle my sexual life. It helped me overcome my little sexual obsessions.

I'm not going to adore ""friends"" unwisely with all infatuations; it has its own flaws, but it does have some hidden layers while you watch it. The things between friends and how they deal with their issues, that's really instructive and sometimes inspirational. I learned how to get along with people I love and how unselfish we should be at some critical points. I learned how sometimes we should be submissive and ignore ourselves; how to be compassionate about our important individuals. How to speak without talking (actually I don't know how I learned that from the series, but I did.)

Chandler always gets right to the point without wasting your time, directly to the ultimate point. He is the very moment joker, who never gets clichéd and is always fresh. Phoebe is extremely creative and comes up with ideas that amaze the audience with its novelty, not clichéd at all. Rachel has the greatest heart which you can hear her heartbeats. After all if I am to choose one of friends to be with, that's for sure Ross.

I used to be a little Monica, but I'm definitely Chandler+Ross. I'm not saying these because I adore these two characters, so I'm trying to say I'm like them; besides maybe no one really cares who I'm alike the most but with this arrangement of characters I think every specific audience can find his/her look-alike to some accuracies. That's the strength of ""friends"".

Of course there are clichéd sequences at the series that sometimes are hard to avoid because, patterns can be not enough. Like when they're apparently unwilling to do something and they come to an agreement not to do that thing, but suddenly someone breaks the ice and others follow. Actually I don't consider these repetitive sequences as a serious shortcoming for two reasons; first, the series is really long and after some time one way or another repetition comes to the way and second, we cannot say we don't have those repetitions in our routine lives, so it's going to be OK because the series is a model of real life.

1685,1685,8.65,17 October 2024,"I started binge-watching a few weeks back. And it's where you get seriously involved as one of the characters in the episode. You get to feel Chandler's jokes, Monica's neuroticism, and Ross's ever-complicated love life. Each character brings something unique, making their interactions both hilarious and heartfelt.

Rachel Green embodies the journey of self-discovery. Starting as a waitress, her transformation into a fashion executive is inspiring. Her on-again, off-again relationship with Ross adds depth, showcasing her struggles with love and independence. You can't help but root for her as she navigates the challenges of adulthood.

Monica Geller, Ross's competitive sister, brings a mix of humor and heart. Her obsessive cleanliness often leads to comedic moments, but her passion for cooking and her journey toward finding love with Chandler make her character relatable. Watching her grow from a neurotic chef to a devoted wife and mother is both touching and entertaining.

Phoebe Buffay is the wild card of the group. Her quirky personality and unique outlook on life are refreshing. From her hilarious songs like ""Smelly Cat"" to her unconventional backstory, Phoebe reminds us to embrace our individuality. Her relationship with Mike showcases her ability to love deeply, adding layers to her free-spirited nature.

Chandler Bing is the Bing/king of sarcasm, with a wit that often hides his insecurities. His journey from a job he hates to finding fulfillment through love with Monica is compelling. Chandler's humor serves as comic relief, yet it also reveals his vulnerability, making him one of the most relatable characters in the group.

Joey Tribbiani is the lovable goofball who captures our hearts with his charm and innocence. His simple-mindedness leads to many laugh-out-loud moments, especially with his infamous pick-up lines. Despite his superficial pursuits, Joey's loyalty and big-heartedness shine through, reminding us of the importance of friendship.

Ross Geller is the intellectual with a knack for romantic entanglements. His passion for paleontology and his complicated relationship with Rachel drive much of the series' drama. Ross's quirks and memorable catchphrases, like ""We were on a break!"" add humor while also showcasing his growth throughout the series.

The chemistry among these six characters is electric. You find yourself laughing, crying, and cheering them on as they navigate life's ups and downs together. Their stories remind us of the importance of friendship, love, and being there for one another. Even after finishing the series, the characters linger in your mind, making you feel like you've lost friends rather than just characters on a screen.

In a world where time feels fleeting, ""Friends"" offers a comforting escape, reminding us of the importance of laughter and connection. It's truly goat stuff, a show that never leaves your heart.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i started bingewatching a few weeks back and its where you get seriously involved as one of the characters in the episode you get to feel chandlers jokes monicas neuroticism and rosss evercomplicated love life each character brings something unique making their interactions both hilarious and heartfelt rachel green embodies the journey of selfdiscovery starting as a waitress her transformation into a fashion executive is inspiring her onagain offagain relationship with ross adds depth showcasing her struggles with love and independence you cant help but root for her as she navigates the challenges of adulthood monica geller rosss competitive sister brings a mix of humor and heart her obsessive cleanliness often leads to comedic moments but her passion for cooking and her journey toward finding love with chandler make her character relatable watching her grow from a neurotic chef to a devoted wife and mother is both touching and entertaining phoebe buffay is the wild card of the group her quirky personality and unique outlook on life are refreshing from her hilarious songs like smelly cat to her unconventional backstory phoebe reminds us to embrace our individuality her relationship with mike showcases her ability to love deeply adding layers to her freespirited nature chandler bing is the bingking of sarcasm with a wit that often hides his insecurities his journey from a job he hates to finding fulfillment through love with monica is compelling chandlers humor serves as comic relief yet it also reveals his vulnerability making him one of the most relatable characters in the group joey tribbiani is the lovable goofball who captures our hearts with his charm and innocence his simplemindedness leads to many laughoutloud moments especially with his infamous pickup lines despite his superficial pursuits joeys loyalty and bigheartedness shine through reminding us of the importance of friendship ross geller is the intellectual with a knack for romantic entanglements his passion for paleontology and his complicated relationship with rachel drive much of the series drama rosss quirks and memorable catchphrases like we were on a break add humor while also showcasing his growth throughout the series the chemistry among these six characters is electric you find yourself laughing crying and cheering them on as they navigate lifes ups and downs together their stories remind us of the importance of friendship love and being there for one another even after finishing the series the characters linger in your mind making you feel like youve lost friends rather than just characters on a screen in a world where time feels fleeting friends offers a comforting escape reminding us of the importance of laughter and connection its truly goat stuff a show that never leaves your heart,POSITIVE

1696,1696,8.65,7 March 2009,"Friends did pretty much rule American comedy culture and one of the most popular programmes in the world. The premise of the sitcom is about six friends from New York starting, in their mid 20s and goes into their 30s. They are Rachel Green, a woman working in the fashion industry; Ross Gellar, a paleontologist who is in love with Rachel; Monica Gellar, Ross' sister, Rachel's best friend and a successful chef; Chandler Bing, an office manager, Ross university roommate and later marries Monica; Joey Tribbiani, an actor who loves women and food; and finally Phoebe Buffay, a masseuse and the most Bohemian of the group.

Friends had some top writers working on the show and kept it consituenly funny, also had drama and strong character development and you see how they all change. Everyone has a favourite character, my was Chancellor. This is comfort viewing, it doesn't matter how many times you have seen it you can just easily watch it over and over again. I grew up with Friends, and like the Simpsons at its peak a highlight of how good American television can be.

Friends was also able to employ top guest stars such as Bruce Willis, Tom Selleck and Hank Azaria. The key actors all had a excellent comedic timing and Friends always did well at the Emmys.

There are some problems in later series. Joey slowly becomes more dumber; when Friends started, Joey was not as well read as the other character but he wasn't stupid.

We pray to God that Joey doesn't get an incurable disease. And we are drawn into these hopeful young peoples' lives and made to feel like we're also sharing a cuppa joe and listening intently to Monica's dating problems or Phoebe's horrendous songs.

It's brilliantly written with great jokes, a great sitcom (strange to seem a great sitcom starring young people). Phoebe and Joey are really funny characters, their dumbness is the reason and their loveibility. Monica was a wonderfully sweet girl at the beginning with a sense of tidiness and bossiness but in the later series, it seems she's been absolutely transformed into this loud, bossy, hardly sweet girl and I always wished for the old Monica back. Ross maybe annoying to some but he does end up with the best lines sometimes in episodes. Rachel is overrated. She may be a big star in real life, being married to Brad Pitt, but it doesn't make her the best character on the show as that goes to Chandler. Who's always being funny and I don't care if the other characters don't like his jokes because I do.

At least in my exprience, a guy who doesnt love romance-comedy at all , I cried like a baby.

It's so rare to see casts that dives really deeply into their characters that you wouldn't be able see if this is a show or real life. It even changes a lot of my perpective about us, human. This show just shows me that people are so complex and complicated with all those various emotions, our life with people around us are meant to be sometimes rough and sometimes smooth.

1770,1770,8.65,7 December 2002,"This series used to be so funny, I mean, it still is funny at times, but as soon as the marriage seasons started (first with Emily, then Chandler/Monica), the series shifted slowly into Soap Opera hell.

Chandler has/had the most brilliant, sarchastic lines, which really made the series more watchable. Why do the other ""Friends"" pick on Chandler and look upon him as a worthless jerk, when he's about the most likeable character in the show? Always hints at him being less manly (or something). In his relationship with Monica he's now the whipped dog, always ""luuuvving"" his wife, slowly becoming less and less funny.

Now, the series are sticky, full of crying and love-declarations. A series that tries to make us believe that a girl's favorite dream is to walk around in a wedding dress, or better: to get married. You would think a sex-fixated series like this would've dared to say that people could DROP MARRIAGE and still be happy, but no.. keep the US family friendly-trash.. (to be honest I don't know why you americans accept this family-propaganda BS) Right now where I live, they're showing Joey falling in love with Rachel, and it's just pure sickening. Joey is only slightly funny in his normal role as incredibly stupid, but when he starts acting emotional, it's throw-up-time.

When Phoebe ""juggles"" two boys or the female characters act slutty in other ways, that's OK, but the boys are always nice, trying to tidy things up, stay pure-hearted and honest-ish; a moral mistake from a boy in Friends is strongly punished. Phoebe is the kind of goose-like woman no man would ever want; still in the series, she'd kick out any wimp-ass man to get the next italian-looking dork who walks past her. She generally acts judgemental and evil in most episodes now, but never gets the kind of low status Chandler has gotten. It was funnier when she was just plain stupid; she was a good ""stupid/ crazy character"" in her time. Ah well..

1774,1774,8.65,29 April 2004,"When Friends began way back in 1994, I was not swept by the euphoria that this TV series started. I did not find it funny, in fact I found it rather silly and could not relate to the 6 characters created. Then one day, I was watching an episode that I started laughing at, then from that time on I was able to relate to Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe, and the crazy antics that each one of them seems to get into.

This half-hour comedy features six young friends who face life and love in New York. Together, they find true companionship and comfort as they get entangled in numerous hilarious dilemmas. Through any circumstance, the group have a bond of friendship that helps them laugh while dealing with the world around them.

The show was created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, and they must be astounded by the popularity of the show. To create such interesting characters was wonderful, with the difference in personalities being fascinating.

This leads me to the dedicated writing team that have brought us 'Friends'. Helping Crane and Kauffman is a huge team of writers. All of these writers have continued to come up with funny, interesting and shocking storylines. It also has to be said, that these people do have a very fine sense of humour, as some of the lines these characters say are priceless. It is credit to these people for how fresh the stories have stayed for the show.

The main characters are all people I have grown to love as I have got to known them. Here is a small piece on each of them:

Rachel (Jennifer Aniston): Rachel is a very good girl at heart, although she can be tough to get along with when she wants. She has a history with Ross that has been funny to see as the years have gone on. It is a known fact that Rachel cannot cook or make a decent cup of coffee. Jennifer Aniston is simply stunning in this role and is probably the only actor out of this six that has been able to transgress into mainstream movie acting.

Ross (David Schwimmer): Ross is a guy that has had some really bad luck, but you would have to also say that he is pretty stupid for some of the things that he does. He has been divorced three times (one from a wife who is now a lesbian). Ross also has some of the more crazy stuff happen to him. David Schwimmer is a very interesting actor, as he really does make a fool of himself for the millions of people around the world. Interesting note: Schwimmer has directed a few episodes of 'friends' as well.

Monica (Courtney Cox Arquette): Monica is Ross' younger sister, a girl who is very head strong, stubborn, unbeatable (in her mind) and someone who likes to get her own way. She is also a person that is very articulate and likes to keep things extremely clean. Monica was once overweight, eating everything she could get her hands on. Courtney Cox is very good at being Monica, with her strange personality a little over the top, while her performances as overweight 'Monica', being the best in the entire show. Cox has been a part of the famous 'Scream' trilogy, which has helped her career. It was funny to see the episode where all the cast had the name 'Cox-Arquette' attached with there names.

Chandler (Matthew Perry): Chandler is the comedian in the group, always likes to laugh, tell a joke or make a smart comment in a conversation. Yet he knows when has said a bad line. Chandler for the best part of the show has had terrible luck with relationships, until he hooked up with Monica, which was one of the big highlights to the show. The lengths that the pair go to hide the fact was very funny. Chandler's parents were also very interesting to meet. Perry plays his part very well (no joke).

Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow): Phoebe is the wacky part of the group. She sings and plays guitar at the coffee shop, albeit badly. She has lost a mother, has an identical twin and has been a surrogate mother for her half brother Frank and his older partner Alice, making her life a bit twisted. Yet through all this she has a very sexy confident manner, which is irresistible not to like. She says and does some of the more silly things, not too unlike Ross. Kudrow plays Phoebe as if she is really like her, but I would be guessing that Kudrow is much different to Phoebe in real life.

Joey (Matt LeBlanc): Joey is the guy all the women die for. Well that is what Joey wants us to believe anyway. He is, I guess, charismatic, but only ever in a relationship for the goal to sleep with the woman in question. Joey is an actor, playing Dr. Drake Ramoray in 'Days Of Our Lives'. He is the unintelligent person in the group, but covers it up pretty well. Joey also has seven sisters. Matt LeBlanc is great as this character, although he is way different to Joey in real life.

'Friends' has had some impressive guest stars including Elle MacPherson, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Selleck, Helen Hunt, Morgan Fairchild and George Clooney to name just a few. I like the sets the show has had, as they are well made and suit the show well. This is a big task for the crew that assemble them. I also love the theme song to Friends titled 'I'll be there for you' sung by the Rembrandts. With Friends now coming to an end, the TV world is losing a big show, as is the audience which it pleases. But we all have to be thankful, that for ten years, our lives have been enriched by six extraordinary people, people I call 'Friends'.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",when friends began way back

lives he is the unintelligent person in the group but covers it up pretty well joey also has seven sisters matt leblanc is great as this character although he is way different to joey in real life

1787,1787,8.65,1 March 2021,"During it's original broadcast I was a huge fan of this show. Even bought the entire DVD series back in the early/ mid 2000's. Have not watched those DVD's since and have not watched the show since.

But recently during COVID I decided to watch a rerun, when I watch the show now it just does not hold up well. The jokes are cheesy, the fashions the guys wore (all the excessive gel and sloppy spiked hair) with those v-neck shirts are laughable now. Aside from the fashion, the plot of the show is just cheesy and predictable, but trying to not be predictable at the same time.

If I had to choose a favorite season, it would have been season one. The rest of the seasons seemed to just blur together, especially in the last 6 seasons.

Some of the gender jokes and plots (Chandlers father playing a transvestite, but it was really a woman playing a transvestite) would be culturally inappropriate today.

As far as scenery, this show does NOT remind me of New York City at all, you can tell it was filmed in Los Angeles. In retrospect while the show is not bad, ....it is just not great, ....it was never a ground breaking show, the tepid 90's style humor and jokes show it was a product of it's time if you watched at all the sitcoms from that era.

1795,1795,8.65,26 May 2020,"I'm sure that everything that needs to be said about this show has been said by now but I just want to say a few things:

As watchable as the show was when you we worn out, the characters could easily be as obnoxious as they were charming.

Monika, I'd like to go easy on. She had a hard time with body image and weight issues even if she could be kind of mean, she is a little bit more broken than most of us.

Phoebe used to be my favorite character. But in time she became the one that annoys me the most. She was the original Luna Lovegood but Luna did it so much better. Your new age, healing crystal nonsense can be funny but that doesn't change that you are a poser and a hypocrite on so many things, delusional about your own level of talent that seems to want to be some warrior for social justice (an admiral thing) but you are just as problematic. To illustrate my point: remember that super sweet and poignant moment where Joey says he wants Chandler to be his plus-one to the premier? Then Phoebe has to say to Monica ""I think these guys want you dress!"". Not only is that a repulsive stab at men showing tenderness to each other, she ruins a great moment.

I like chandler. People say he's annoying but I reckon he was always the outcast kids and just wants attention anyway he can get it. He's the character I root for the most.

Joey is an idiot. I appreciate it's not his fault i know but let's not downplay that he doesn't know anything about anything except seducing women. I'll be the first to admit I'm jealous that's not a secret but how does this guy manage it when people who are just as attractive and know something about something fail? He's the go to comic relief to be sure but I won't hide I laugh at him more than I laugh with him.

And finally: Rachel. That Rachel...Yeah I get the whole spoilt girl on her own angle and that was cool for a while. But she never stopped being a spoilt, narcissistic shrew that just caused way more problems that she was worth and had some personal grown but nowhere near enough for me to want to go easy on her. David Shwimmer's character deserves so much better (not Emily she was awful and had an English accent more jarring than mine but still). He should have just gave up on her very early on. He is so much more sympathetic. They were never a will-they-won't-they, they were an always-totally-were which was the wrong movie.

This show is perhaps the first '90s show to feel retro with its electric guitar transitions and how it seems to think it's so edgy an hip for talking about lesbianism and pre-marital polygamy and stuff. In that regard it can be fascinating or annoying depending on your mood.

These writers knew what they were doing. They were clever with how the mix of clever and dumb humor made this show feel safe and friendly (no pun intended) when you were in a bad mood. It keeps finding new audiences with the new generations and even my dad just keeps watching it though I know he's seen it all.

My favourite gag of all time of the show is...the one that ends ""baby kangaroo Tribaini"".

For me the worst thing was that saga with Emily.

The ending was basically impeccable even if i am not team Rachel.

And one more thing: They were on a break! But even if they weren't Rachel deserved it. Wish he'd stayed with Bruce Willis' daughter...

1812,1812,8.65,5 December 2008,"Many times I back away of writing about it. It brings the worst of me, and it doesn't deserve the time either. But let's do it anyway. So, simply why it is hatful, AND causes this huge amount of provocation also?!

_It got a more-than-enough-time on the TV. Actually, 10 years is a time record, and a proof of being pushed by the network deceitfully as the ""best of the best""?? It's not about bad work, No, it's about bad work that had been propagandized as great. It could be the ultimate scheme where the sponsors or the advertisement's companies promoted it heavily and incessantly like that. And it's the urge to find any star-show, superiority's symbol, or any number one even forcedly, falsely, whatever. It's how to sell the so-so, or what's lower, as big, and make it sound brilliant. It reminds me when some movies' channel promoted (Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace - 1999), before airing it, as the highest grossing movie OF ALL TIME, while it's absolute garbage, and everybody knows about it. It's more like the top of the American box office holy list, where number one is one because it made half a million (and it ends up having only this half of million too!). Well, believe it or not, (You Got Served - 2004) was on the top of this list one day. So the lesson is: Don't believe the propaganda.

_The characters are ugly. When you have a comedy about nerds, morons, or idiots persons, so that's the definition of low, cheap, easy comedy for me. Here, I felt so many times that the dumb characters had been handled, and developed, dumbly too. Other shows got humans in it, though here they were the caricature yet of who? Of originally perfectly caricature! It's like a silly parody of silly cartoon. It even didn't reach to be the brainless amusing, or the light smiling time. It didn't get (Becker - 1998: 2004)'s plain deepness, neither the efforts of (Seinfeld - 1989: 1998)'s writing. GOD, it was hopelessly tasteless all along!

_Most of the cast is in one word: Unfunny. Save (Kudrow), there was a pretense of being laughable where ""pretending"" replaces nonexistent talent or risible charisma. Nearly all of them weren't innately droll. Nearly all of them were unbearable in other roles in cinema, especially the all-time-awful (Matthew Perry). I want to send him a message that says: please, making laughs is not about fallen down or goggling eyes only, and if you don't understand, search for another job to have mercy on yourself and us!

_Be ready for this: Every moron of this bunch at one step had ONE MILLION DOLLAR payment for every single episode of this nonsense. Highly provocative huh?!

_The chain of relationships in the show's drama! I was sick of cases like: sleep with me, slept with him, slept with her, sleeping with everybody!! And they're calling it Friends?! Well, at least not my kind of friends. And for its fans: wouldn't you feel wrong with that ever? I mean you never felt that these fellows' sexual behaviors were so exaggeratedly reckless?! Really, didn't anyone feel disgust out of this, or sense how that was too much sometimes, and not in a comic way?!! Anyhow, I couldn't stand those friends or this friendship. Maybe it's something the rich brats, more than the middle-class, can appreciate and love, or maybe it's something produced by the rich brats for the middle-class to appreciate and love!

_Now for something irritating yet doesn't belong to the show; it ran for a decade already, while - in the same time - some good shows with potential, and creative actors, weren't given the chance to continue properly. So you have to feel implied anger because of the long continuation of it, while other extremely better, shows got the ""cancel"" decision way early. Over and above, I think good shows like (Vengeance Unlimited - 1998: 1999) were canceled because it got in the way of (Friends)'s time on air. Ok, that's another reason to be angry!

_The fact of being on every channel, with non-stoppable reruns. It's naturally since it's a long one, with more than 200 episodes. However, think of it from my point of view; it's like running into your horrid ogre on TV everyday! Plus, it's truly a killer when you have other versions of it internationally, with some trash that nearly imitates it, and delivers its goods perhaps purely or excessively, like for horrible instance (That 70s Show - 1998: 2006)!

_I feel bad when shoddy, banal at its best, work like that, with no serious anything, or even a respectable comedy, has more than it merits. It's so underrated when it comes to evaluate its real position. I recall the saying ""Not every great is famous, and not every famous is great"". So, when you hear a dude saying: ""It's the best show I saw in my whole life!"" you must understand fine just 2 things: 1) Everybody's entitled to their own opinion. 2) This dude surely didn't watch many shows in his ""whole life""..

1818,1818,8.65,1 December 2004,"The long running ""Friends"" was a carefree comedy that well deserved the recognition it received. The writers always created a plot that would draw the viewer out of the stressful real world into the carefree NY of ""Friends."" There was always some witty line or humorous event in the show that could get a laugh, which is, after all, the point of a sitcom. The real magic of this show, however, came not from the writers, but from the characters and the incredible chemistry they shared. It seems unlikely that a spoiled, rich, pretty girl, an uptight, clean-freak, formally fat chef, a dorky paleontologist recently divorced from his lesbian wife, a sarcastic son of a cross-dressing father who is bored with his job, an Italian playboy from a large family who loves eating sandwiches, and a singer-songwriter masseuse who lived in a box after her mother killed herself could be thrown into the same world and come out friends, but this eclectic mixture makes for variety and creates situations that could not happen on any other show. Occasionally ""Friends"" becomes formulaic, as with the mandatory dating between friends, but the characters are endearing, and throughout the course of the show, the viewer comes to love them. The character quirks of ""Friends"" are so endearing, that they have shaped American society. Where would we be without Joey's favorite pickup line ""How you doing?"" The show is humorous because the characters are flawed, thus they are real. Their flaws may be exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but the viewer can still relate to the characters, because (aside from the fact that they magically earn a living by going to their job about once a month) they are real.

1820,1820,8.65,5 February 2003,"I was in the Sixth Grade when friends first aired. It wasn't as funny as seinfeld but it was close. The first three seasons of Friends were absolutely hilarious. But as I look back on the plot lines, they focused on the wrong things. The things that make me laugh like no other are pheobe being pregnant with her brothers twins and needing to eat meat, rachel dressing up like a cheerleader to get a guy, joey being on days of our lives etc. NOBODY CARES ABOUT ROSS AND RACHEL or CHANDLER AND MONICA.

Focusing on this well, . . . crap, has permanently made the reruns of this show unwatchable. 7 years after it started, ross and rachel are still a big question mark. How ridiculous. And when you watch reruns of the show, the center of the show is jockeying between which friend is dating who and who's freaked out about marriage at the time. Who wouldn't have guessed that chandler would ""flip out"" at his wedding, he'd been doing it for 7 years.

Also, i saw a recent episode that relied completely on jokes started in the first season. Everyone at chandler's work thought he was gay. ""hahaha"" make an episode about it. But then every episode after the same shtick starts. in the ninth season, ross still cries out, ""if rachel wants to kiss other guys, then so will I!"" to which chandler looks at him with a ""?!?!??!?!?!?!?"" expression. I rest my case. it's just not funny. the characters weren't that original to start off with. This show should have ended after the 5th season.

Friends is its own world. I live in new york, and i have never seen ANY sort of life like that of the friends crew. I've never sat in a an all caucasion coffee house or gotten an exec job at ralph lauren with ""waitressing at central perk"" as the main part of my resume. Sit coms all have their individual problems, but friends needs to quit while it's ahead. I'll still watch the older episodes and laugh myself silly. They should have been making one million an episode then when they were actually trying to produce something funny and worthwhile and not just letting the series play out with no work.

And as for the individual characters, recently, all of them except joey are SO irritating i can't even make it through a show. I miss the days of Rachel spraining her ankle and having no insurance and of monica trying to become a chef. What do they do now? well, that's a good question . . . i think they do nothing (rachel doesn't even take care of this baby that ""resurrected the show,"" the nanny carts her around) apparently it's something so entertaining and important to society that NBC feels it should center a show around it for another year.

1827,1827,8.65,7 February 2023,"This is one of the best American sitcoms that exist. And particularly the first couple of seasons were decent fun. The characters were one sided and they were easy to relate. Halfway through, they became more than one sided New Yorkers. It was still great to watch though. Because they were developing and the show was still funny. But six seasons into the show, the characters that I liked so much in the first place, somehow managed to be really really unlikeable. The fact that I realized they were always telling these stupid lies to each other, made the whole show much less enjoyable. I actually think that the last half should be called ""Liars"" instead of the original title.

1830,1830,8.65,25 January 2005,"This show was the thorn in the side for many lovers of wit, art and taste for an entire decade. This show just kept going, season after season, and none of us could figure out who the fools were that kept it on the air by watching it. Some of us suspected a terrorist plot to dumb down America; surely the ratings were rigged.

The show focused on up-scale yuppies whose glorified materialism provided most the plot fodder. The jokes were dumb and usually predictable. The acting was untrained and unfocused. There was no emotional connection between viewer and those on screen; when Rachel was pregnant there was a glimmer of hope she would die during child-birth. No such luck, of course.

Most episodes exploited human sexuality, but that is nothing new in 1990s television. Cheap sex captures attention and saves the writers from having to do any creative work.

The fact that unscrupulous network executives, producers, etc. broadcast this show with full knowledge and intent of it being seen by children is unforgivable. The show's main themes were not friendship (for a better understanding of Friendship Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics is recommended) but rather hedonism, sexuality, materialism, and foolishness. Those who knowingly beamed this show to children made their pockets of dough, but on judgment day they just best not talk about their souls.

If you are looking for intelligent comedy, look elsewhere. As of this writing, IMDb recommends fans of this show also watch The Bob Newhart Show. This is ironic since both Newhart's main shows are brilliant. Friends, on the other hand, is trash.

Then of course, there's the sub-friends: Gunther (James Michael Taylor) a Central Perk waiter who lusts after Rach; Carol (Jane Sibbett), Ross's ex-wife-turned-lesbian; and Ursula, Phoebe's twin sister (and porn star!) - also played by Lisa Kudrow.

I'm sure the writers of these episodes, at one point figured ""Hey, since we have no more plot ideas, let's have ____ sleep with ______"". Literally every character on this show has slept with at least two other members of their little circle of friends. Nobody in their right mind could ever relate to these spoiled brats. The friends' financial security seems quite suspicious considering most of these friends are working jobs that fetch minimum wage, so how can they afford those plush NY apartments and gorgeous clothes? Plus, I hate how whiny these guys are. They seem very well-to-do despite their minimum wage jobs, but are still hopelessly miserable because of their relationship failures (hint: try breeding outside your little circle of friends, and maybe then you'd actually have a long-lasting relationship, you whiny dolts!). Here's a rundown of the personalities on ""Friends that, from what the show tells viewers, are apparently the basic types of people in NY... Chandler: token ""sardonic witty guy"". Monica: token ""Neat Freak"". Joey: token ""Lovable male moron"". Ross: token ""Lovable geek. Phoebe: token ""Spaced-out female moron"". Rachel: token ""Bland and boring, somewhat neutral character used as basis of comparison for how 'normal' the rest of the neurotic characters should be, but aren't"".

1852,1852,8.65,2 June 2005,"I spent years absolutely hating Friends for even pretending that it was a comedy, but I think I've had a slight reappraisal recently.

I still think it would be hard-pressed to be less funny. As far as I could see, there are only limited number of 'laughs' on Friends:

1) Phoebe calls someone something funny, eg. someone walks in with a pair of rabbit ears on and Phoebe says, ""Hey, rabbit boy.""

2) Speaking in a funny voice.

3) Age-old immediately rebuked ironic statement, eg. someone says they aren't afraid of mice, a mouse appears and they jump on the table and start screaming. This happens once in Blackadder and was kind of a let-down for me because it reminded me of Friends, even though associating the two would be like trying to draw comparisons between Sirloin Steak and a hamburger.

If I missed something then I probably didn't see the episode in which it happened.

BUT strangely, and worryingly, all that doesn't make it the least funny programme you can watch. That prize has to be shared by the multitude of follow-up 'sitcoms' like Will and Grace etc etc, which can even make Friends seem humorous.

In defence of the show, I do realise that there are many people, I even know some of them, who would rather miss out on oxygen than Friends. And by listening when they talk about Friends I get the impression that what is most important to a devotee is the story-line. Cliff-hangers at the end of series don't happen in most sitcoms after all. I get the feeling that they would watch Friends even if it was announced that the next series would be pure drama and would make no attempt to be funny. I think it has been around long enough that, in the viewer's eyes, the comedy aspect has lost its significance in comparison to simply being able to keep track of the characters' lives.

I haven't maybe watched enough Friends to comment on its value as a drama, but I do know that I can count the number of times it has made me laugh on one finger. So, I offer no opinion of where Friends stands amongst the ranks of drama series, but for people to call it a 'comedy', let alone 'the funniest programme ever', is frankly an insult to the many programmes out there that are actually funny.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i spent years absolutely hating friends for even pretending that it was a comedy but i think ive had a slight reappraisal recently i still think it would be hardpressed to be less funny as far as i could see there are only limited number of laughs on friends phoebe calls someone something funny eg someone walks in with a pair of rabbit ears on and phoebe says hey rabbit boy speaking in a funny voice ageold immediately rebuked ironic statement eg someone says they arent afraid of mice a mouse appears and they jump on the table and start screaming this happens once in blackadder and was kind of a letdown for me because it reminded me of friends even though associating the two would be like trying to draw comparisons between sirloin steak and a hamburger if i missed something then i probably didnt see the episode in which it happened but strangely and worryingly all that doesnt make it the least funny programme you can watch that prize has to be shared by the multitude of followup sitcoms like will and grace etc etc which can even make friends seem humorous in defence of the show i do realise that there are many people i even know some of them who would rather miss out on oxygen than friends and by listening when they talk about friends i get the impression that what is most important to a devotee is the storyline cliffhangers at the end of series dont happen in most sitcoms after all i get the feeling that they would watch friends even if it was announced that the next series would be pure drama and would make no attempt to be funny i think it has been around long enough that in the viewers eyes the comedy aspect has lost its significance in comparison to simply being able to keep track of the characters lives i havent maybe watched enough friends to comment on its value as a drama but i do know that i can count the number of times it has made me laugh on one finger so i offer no opinion of where friends stands amongst the ranks of drama series but for people to call it a comedy let alone the funniest programme ever is frankly an insult to the many programmes out there that are actually funny,NEGATIVE

1858,1858,8.65,25 February 2000,"I had never fallen in love with a tv show before I started watching Friends. It's incredible how you start to be a part of the group like you were one of them. When I saw it for the first time, I thought it was very funny and intelligent, I certainly want to see it again, but after the third time I saw it, I just couldn't stop anymore, I watched all the episodes that came after it, and start watching the old ones every day. It became one of the most important things of my life, if for some reason I couldn't see it, I went to bed like something was missing.

There is nothing special about the show and maybe it's the reason why it is so great, you feel yourself at home, suddenly you forget all your problems and feel like you were the seventh one of a group of friends who spend all the time taking the best of the life, even when they are in trouble they never lose the sense of humor. It's a wonderful lesson to be learn, life is so beautiful that we should never waste our time worrying about anything.

Besides that, the cast couldn't be better, we see a connection between them, they are actually friends what makes it more real and they look like normal person, people who could be our friend, they don't look like celebrities. Phoebe is the funniest character, Lisa Kudrow is perfect. Courtney Cox plays my favorite one, Monica is like central of the group, she dates Chandler, is the sister of Ross and she kind of introduce the other girls.

1860,1860,8.65,4 December 2006,"I must say that,after watching every(?) episode of this series,I found myself,unlike other shows that went into syndication(""Seinfeld"",""Threes Company"",""Cheers"",""Benson"" for examples)that I had enjoyed,I had had enough of it.

Maybe it's because the show,a ten year ratings winner on NBC,was SO made over in it's run that by the time it had wrapped,all the ""Will Ross and Rahel get together?"" and ""Will they know about Chandler and Monica?"" type questions and plot-arcs,coupled with the make-cute leaps in plot-logic(as mentioned before,the fact that there seemed to be nary a person of color in NYC that the gang of six ran into until about season five or that,despite the fact that all six usually had jobs,they still had an inordinate amount of time to spend socializing at the Central Perk or at their apartments,for examples)had me burned-out on it. Otherwise,I have to say that this show,which was born around the premise of creating a ""Seinfeld"" for Gen'Xers,actually worked. Worked a lot better than it had a right to be.

In other words,in the hands of different writers and(especially)different actors,this show would've been a leaden wannabe. The whole sextet is strong,with standout s(in my opinion)being Lisa Kudrow as the loopy,eccentric and savant-like Phoebe Buffay,Matthew Perry as the put-upon wiseacre Chandler Bing and Matt LeBlanc as goofy pretty-boy actor Joey Tribbiani. While I'm not sure they merited the million-an-episode they garnered by the show's mid-run,I DO believe that they(and I mean all six of 'em,really) earned the right to being invaluable assets to a hit t.v. show and budding stars in their own rights.

1868,1868,8.65,13 January 2002,"Friends just gets better and better. In the last season I especially noticed the quality of Matt Leblanc's acting. He does more with a double take face shot or turn of a phrase than anyone with a 5 minute dialogue. That said this Ms. Pacman episode was a prime example. The expression on his face with date when she says she looks different at someone by looking at them from behind was an Actor's Studio worthy discussion of how to do a double take. The finale with Rachel in his arms was subtle, heart warming and so real.

What sets Friends apart is how when it's ""on"" it hits every mark. As strong as the Joey, Rachel storyline in this episode exceled in showcasing three stories. For nostalgia fans the Ms. Pacman was not only hilarious but come on admit it down right true! Who hasn't filled the best off scores with dirty words only to realize ""how am I going to get these off?"". Lisa Kudrow take a bow.

Finally David Shwimmer deserves a very large piece of credit for this best of the series episode. A show as good as writing may be still must make it visually to the screen. Shwimmer's direction, blocking, close-ups to get Matt and Lisa's performance made the episode.

1869,1869,8.65,30 January 2000,"Since its debut in Australia in 1996, imitations of ""Friends"" have been strewn all along the Australian T.V schedule. It has remained the country's highest ranked T.V show ever since then. This proves the creators MUST be doing something right.

The half hour sitcom provides a hilarious insight into the lives of six now thirty somethings living in well furnished apartments with terrible jobs and equally worse love lives. Its excellence away from the standard pack of comedies is that it doesn't need to try very hard to be funny. Instead of trying to create a fantasy world, the creators wrote exactly about what they knew when they were in their twenties.

All the characters, funny, smart and sexy, are loveable people that we want to know, who we have come to know over the years. Chandler, Joey, Ross, Monica, Phoebe and Rachel have in a sense, become a part of every day life. In its somewhat miraculous conception, the writers have averted the deadliness of favouratism within the ensemble.

In embarrassing ways, the situations these people continually find themselves trapped within the throes of imagination, can be related to on some other level. This remains one of the many reasons ""Friends"" has deserved success.

As the premiere of the sixth season in Australia dawns, one can only wonder how much longer the freshness and creativity of the sitcom can be sustained. Some of the hilarity in the fifth season has diminished and it will be far better if the sitcom is ended on a high note.

1881,1881,8.65,20 October 1999,"Unless season 6 turns out to be a total disaster, then ""Friends"" will probably in my opinion stay one of, if not the best TV show ever. It is with no doubt my favorite half-hour of the week.

""Friends"" has all the elements, which make up a sound and solid sitcom. The cast is unbelievably talented. All six of them portray their character so well and unlike many other shows, they have really good chemistry. The scripts are amazingly well written, the dialogue is always sharp and the jokes are consistently funny. I can watch each episode over and over and they will still make me laugh.

Some of the episodes, which deliver the most laughs, are funny enough, those, which really have ""no point"". For instance, take ""The One Where No One's Ready"". The whole episode took place on the same set and was about the six of them getting ready to go. Or ""The One Where Ross Can't Flirt"", where the whole gang is gathered in front of the TV tuned into Law & Order. They even made the episode about throwing a ball funny. And then there were those other episodes, which not only made us laugh, but also touched us. Fans will remember moments from the past such as the kiss in ""The One Where Ross Finds Out"" and the break-up in ""The One The Morning After"", which brought cheers and tears.

The show also appeals to such a broad range of viewers. The reason for this is that it is purposely not targeted at a specific audience or generation; all my friends can't live without it, my brother loves it, my mom and her friends watch it and it even entertains my 88-year-old grandmother.

So take six talented young actors, a couple of writers with a good sense of humor and get Kevin Bright, Marta Kauffman, David Crane to produce it and there you have it, ""Friends"".

1882,1882,8.65,23 August 2000,"I think that Friends is the best sitcom to come out of the states since Cheers. The characters are excellent and I have to say that my favourite is Chandler (Matthew Perry). He comes up with some great punchlines and I think that his wit is what keeps some of the less exciting episodes going. Everyone plays their respective roles well.

Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel who at the beginning is seen as a spoiled rich kid. She eventually changes though, and is now part of the working world. Courtney Cox plays Monica, who sometimes gets on my nerves and is my least favourite character. She is obsessed with being neat and tidy and sometimes this is really annoying. I guess that means she plays the part very well. Phoebe is played by Lisa Kudrow and she is definitely my next favourite. She is so unpredictable and next to Chandler, she comes up with the most funny and wacky lines. Her song ""Smelly cat"" is one of those songs that just keeps going around inside your head!

Ross, played by David Schwimmer, is the shy doctor and is Monica's brother. He can have his moments but mostly he just plays off the other characters. Joey, played by Matt LeBlanc, is the next character that I like the most. Joey and Chandler are the funniest duo in sitcom today, I can safely say. When Chandler eventually moved in Monica, the plot lost some of the funnier moments, but thanks to some clever writing, not that much. My favourite episode has to be ""The one with the Prom video"". This shows how Ross wanted to bring Rachel to the prom when her date didn't show. Rachel sees this video and she and Ross finally get together.

Friends is definitely a must see and even for people who don't follow the story every week, it is a good watch.

1883,1883,8.65,5 June 2000,"I started watching Friends near the end of the first season. (TOW the Ick Factor is the first episode I saw) I got hooked on it quite quickly. It is definitely one of the best shows on TV and an argument could be made for it being one of the best sitcoms of all time. However, with shows like All in the Family, M*A*S*H, Cheers, Mary Tyler Moore, and The Honeymooners, that's extremely tough company to break into.

Seasons 1 and 2 had great potential, but the show went downhill in the middle of season 3 and did not pick up again until season 4. (For episode purposes, I would say the time just after the Turkey Bowl game until the time Joey meets Kathy in season 4.) Season 5, easily the best season they ever had. Season 6, if it weren't for the last 4 episodes, would have been something of a disappointment.

I always thought it funny that people in the past (and in the present) said it was a sad copy of Seinfeld. Friends is one of the few shows in the 90's that WASN'T a copy of Seinfeld. An entire genre of comedian-hosted shows could be listed here, and only a small handful (Home Improvement, Ellen, and Drew Carey) could be considered good. I always equated Friends to be more along the lines of ""Cheers"" without a main character. When you think about the comparisons (bar vs. coffee shop, assortment of different personalities, situations, etc.) I think you'd agree with that.

Best episodes: TOW Everybody Finds Out (Season 5), TOW The Flashback (Season 3), TOW The Thanksgiving Flashbacks (Season 5), TOW The Prom Video (Season 2), TOW Two Parts (Season 1), and TOW Ross' Wedding (Season 4)

Worst episodes: TOW The Cat (Season 4), TOW The Ultimate Fighting Champion (Season 3), TOW The Unagi (Season 6), TOW The Jellyfish (Season 4), TOW The Bullies (Season 2)

Joey-He is all about the women. He is stupid, but charming. He can't speak French for the life of himself. J'm'app-ell(sorry about spelling) Claude. Blah blah blah blah Claude.

1902,1902,8.65,31 October 2001,"I am quite insulted that some people think this is the best comedy since Seinfeld. Firstly, it is unfair to both shows because Seinfeld cannot be matched. I must admit that I watched a few of the earlier episodes because of the hype and the stars, but I found it mediocre, mildly amusing at best. It wasn't awful, just nothing particularly special. It was bearable to the extent that I would watch it if there was nothing else on.

But recently I saw a couple of episodes of the new series, and I was appalled by how bad it had become. The jokes are just not funny anymore, and appear to be based solely on the stupidity of the characters now (who were never really that bright to begin with). The characters have seem to have lost appeal and dimension, becoming very single faceted- especially Joey (I've noticed his IQ dwindle quite significantly from the first series). Ross has always been annoying, Monica has never really been funny and Phoebe has always been irritatingly unfunny. Chandler, who was quite funny earlier because his jokes were based on wit, has lost much his luster.

How it is able to sustain ratings is quite beyond me. I think if people step back and look at how much the show has deteriorated, they will realise that they have been watching the show for the sake of watching it rather than for any serious enjoyment. Either that or they still think the girls/guys are hot.

By the way, how could Aniston possibly be nominated for an Emmy? She's an adequate professional actor, but definitely not Emmy standard. Then again, Jerry Seinfeld was nominated year after year despite looking like he was going to crack up laughing in at least one scene every episode.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i am quite insulted that some people think this is the best comedy since seinfeld firstly it is unfair to both shows because seinfeld cannot be matched i must admit that i watched a few of the earlier episodes because of the hype and the stars but i found it mediocre mildly amusing at best it wasnt awful just nothing particularly special it was bearable to the extent that i would watch it if there was nothing else on but recently i saw a couple of episodes of the new series and i was appalled by how bad it had become the jokes are just not funny anymore and appear to be based solely on the stupidity of the characters now who were never really that bright to begin with the characters have seem to have lost appeal and dimension becoming very single faceted especially joey ive noticed his iq dwindle quite significantly from the first series ross has always been annoying monica has never really been funny and phoebe has always been irritatingly unfunny chandler who was quite funny earlier because his jokes were based on wit has lost much his luster how it is able to sustain ratings is quite beyond me i think if people step back and look at how much the show has deteriorated they will realise that they have been watching the show for the sake of watching it rather than for any serious enjoyment either that or they still think the girlsguys are hot by the way how could aniston possibly be nominated for an emmy shes an adequate professional actor but definitely not emmy standard then again jerry seinfeld was nominated year after year despite looking like he was going to crack up laughing in at least one scene every episode,NEGATIVE

Friends is about six friends who live in new york! these friends include Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green, David Shwimmer as Ross Gellar, Courtney Cox Arquette as Monica Gellar, Matt le-Blanc as Joey Tribbiani, Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing and last but not least Lisa Kudrow as Pheobe Buffay! they all unique in different ways and all give out a different characteristic that different people can relate to! this is why its loved so much!

I am aiming to get every single episode on DVD so far i have series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7! i would recommend friends to anyone who likes a good comedy.

i was so sad when friends ended in may this year! the last episode was fantastic! it was moving, hilarious, upsetting all in one! i cant believe that its over i haven't really got my head round it yet! i must sound really geeky but it is the best sitcom i have ever seen! in fact its the only sitcom i can watch over and over and over again without getting bored and thats unusual for me!

anyone who hasn't seen it must be mad! you should start watching TODAY! you will fall in love with it i swear!

1911,1911,8.65,13 September 2004,"FRIENDS...

Some of my friends were always telling me to watch FRIENDS... but I refused every time... till the day I sat in front of my TV and gave it a chance. I can't describe how pleased I was! I have watched from the first season to the sixth and now I'm waiting for the realese of the seasons remaining...

It's just too good to see these friends get together... All that jokes and funny situations get lots of laughs from me (sometimes I also drop a tear).

I think Chandler and Monica are the best characters. I like them so much... Maybe it is because I have some of Monica's crazies... and sometimes I make fun of my friends, just like Chandler does. I don't know...

What I know for sure is that FRIENDS is great TV show, not because it discusses all the big questions of Humanity, such as ""Where I came from?"" or ""What is meaning of life?"". It is great because it doesn't matter what is going on in your life: all you need to get your heart light is to watch these funny friends for a couple of minutes...

Yes... you will always be able to find out some of your friends characteristics among those portrayed by Chandler, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel and Ross.

The actors are so good that the character they play will always be remembered. It is impossible to Jennifer Aniston without thinking of Rachel... and the same to the others...

I can't wait the next season come to the store... And I already have that strange feeling that you have when you know something you like is about to end...

I know ten years is a lot of time... but... it doesn't matter how long you stay with your best friend (or FRIENDS)... if you know he is leaving it seems that your heart is being broken.

Yea... these six FRIENDS will always be among the best memories I'll have.

Hope to hear from you around the world that also like FRIENDS...","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends some of my friends were always telling me to watch friends but i refused every time till the day i sat in front of my tv and gave it a chance i cant describe how pleased i was i have watched from the first season to the sixth and now im waiting for the realese of the seasons remaining its just too good to see these friends get together all that jokes and funny situations get lots of laughs from me sometimes i also drop a tear i think chandler and monica are the best characters i like them so much maybe it is because i have some of monicas crazies and sometimes i make fun of my friends just like chandler does i dont know what i know for sure is that friends is great tv show not because it discusses all the big questions of humanity such as where i came from or what is meaning of life it is great because it doesnt matter what is going on in your life all you need to get your heart light is to watch these funny friends for a couple of minutes yes you will always be able to find out some of your friends characteristics among those portrayed by chandler monica joey phoebe rachel and ross the actors are so good that the character they play will always be remembered it is impossible to jennifer aniston without thinking of rachel and the same to the others i cant wait the next season come to the store and i already have that strange feeling that you have when you know something you like is about to end i know ten years is a lot of time but it doesnt matter how long you stay with your best friend or friends if you know he is leaving it seems that your heart is being broken yea these six friends will always be among the best memories ill have hope to hear from you around the world that also like friends,POSITIVE

1913,1913,8.65,16 August 2004,"Friends is an amazing show. It is the best show I have ever seen and it's definitely my favorite show ever! They picked brilliant actors to play the parts and I love all of them. What's so great about friends is you feel like you know them. You feel like they are YOUR friends and you can relate to them on so many levels. Whenever I feel sad I just put in a video of friends and laugh my way out of the blues. I have seen most episodes 4 or 5 times and the episodes on my tapes over 15 but I still laugh at the jokes. Friends make me feel so comfortable...they don't seem just like jokes they seem like inside jokes between me and my friends that I could hear 2000 times and still love it and think it is hilarious. The writing is tremendous and so is the acting. I think many people judge it after the first time of seeing it and think it's stupid. To all of you who did that, give it another chance. Watch 2 or 3 more episodes and you'll love it. From Monica's obsessions to Chandler's sarcasm. From Rachel's gossip to Joey's cluelessness. From Phoebe's ditziness, to Ross's loyalty.

1915,1915,8.65,16 January 2003,"I generally tend to hate shows everyone won't shut up about and the ones that get like a gazillion viewers every week because that just makes you look harder for flaws, but I can't do that with Friends. Yes, as everyone has said, there are flaws, but if you are looking for the flaws then you're missing the point anyways. Do you sit down and watch a sitcom to see what you can complain about in it or do you sit down to watch it and have fun?

One thing that you do need to get through this thing is a little suspension of disbelief, however. To believe that an actual person can be as ditzy as Phoebe or as stupid as Joey requires some leeway there. Joey would be put in ""special"" place if he were real and Phoebe...well...let's just say she'd also be a ""special"" girl. The jokes are often very unrealistic in the fact that no one's life is THAT funny and no one tells jokes every 30 seconds.

The whole laugh track seems timed, and that is one thing I will comment on about being flawed. I hate the whole system where they babble about something, make a joke, babble, joke, babble, joke...see where I'm going? And no one in the show seems to think anything is funny. Something insanely funny will happen to, let's say, Phoebe, so that you are cracking up and the other people (Ross, Rachel, etc.) are just standing there. Their reactions are all wrong.

In one episode, Rachel let a pillow fall off their apartment balcony and later a man came to their door and handed the pillow to Chandler, who was unaware it had even fallen, and he takes it with a weird look, the laugh track goes crazy, and he turns around and just sets it down, not even bothering to ask his friends in the room ""What the hell was that about?"" I mean, who would just put it aside and not say ""Hey guys, someone just gave me a pillow..."". Hello? He just forgets it? Sure.

But all this is not the point, however bad it may seem. It's a fun show with funny situations and the characters are great so the show has endured for years. If only people in real life knew how to kick it back like these people, there'd be no worries. I think everyone could take an example from the characters of Friends.

And by the way, what's with the bad reviews? I mean, the show gets number 1 or 2 every week in the Nielsen's...that MILLIONS and MILLIONS of viewers...obviously just about...gee...90 PERCENT of America thinks it's funny! Who's bad-mouthing, the other 10 percent? Enjoy it, it's a funny show.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i generally tend to hate shows everyone wont shut up about and the ones that get like a gazillion viewers every week because that just makes you look harder for flaws but i cant do that with friends yes as everyone has said there are flaws but if you are looking for the flaws then youre missing the point anyways do you sit down and watch a sitcom to see what you can complain about in it or do you sit down to watch it and have fun one thing that you do need to get through this thing is a little suspension of disbelief however to believe that an actual person can be as ditzy as phoebe or as stupid as joey requires some leeway there joey would be put in special place if he were real and phoebewelllets just say shed also be a special girl the jokes are often very unrealistic in the fact that no ones life is that funny and no one tells jokes every seconds the whole laugh track seems timed and that is one thing i will comment on about being flawed i hate the whole system where they babble about something make a joke babble joke babble jokesee where im going and no one in the show seems to think anything is funny something insanely funny will happen to lets say phoebe so that you are cracking up and the other people ross rachel etc are just standing there their reactions are all wrong in one episode rachel let a pillow fall off their apartment balcony and later a man came to their door and handed the pillow to chandler who was unaware it had even fallen and he takes it with a weird look the laugh track goes crazy and he turns around and just sets it down not even bothering to ask his friends in the room what the hell was that about i mean who would just put it aside and not say hey guys someone just gave me a pillow hello he just forgets it sure but all this is not the point however bad it may seem its a fun show with funny situations and the characters are great so the show has endured for years if only people in real life knew how to kick it back like these people thered be no worries i think everyone could take an example from the characters of friends and by the way whats with the bad reviews i mean the show gets number or every week in the nielsensthat millions and millions of viewersobviously just aboutgee percent of america thinks its funny whos badmouthing the other percent enjoy it its a funny show,POSITIVE

It's nowhere near stretched out, the characters remain fresh, and one can only WISH you had friends like these? There's Chandler M. Bing, the one who makes fun of his 5 friends in this show, yet they all make fun of him, not always appreciated by Mr. Bing himself. Married to Monica Geller, these two are the only married couple inside this friends gang.. There's Rachel Karen Green, a once posh, spoiled rich girl who made it on her own, without help of her dad's creditcard, but with these friends.

Joey Francis Tribbiani, the ladies man, who as an actor wishes to be Al Pacino, instead of being just as good as him. He may not be the smartest of the bunch, but he's always there when you need a little Joey! Ross Geller, the nerdy geeky guy, works something with dinosaurs, had a crush on Rachel like, forever, and now has a child with her. A bit soft, but loyal to his friends, it wouldn't be the same without a little bit Ross.. Monica Geller, the one who's always the host of the gang. Used to be very big when she was young, she and Rachel are the ones who know each other the longest. Obsessive in a funny way, you can tell she's related to Ross :) Last but not least there's Phoebe Buffay, the masseuse who's a bit weird and funky!

These 6 friends share a life together, most of the time in Monica's appartment or at Central Perk, a coffeehouse in New York, and in a funny way we see what's going on in their lives.

Recommended episodes are: Pilot Episode, TOW No One's Ready, TOW The Prom Video, TOW That Could've Been, TOW The Free Porn, TOW All The Thanksgivings, TOW Everyone Finds Out, TOW The Chick And The Duck, TOW Ross Got High.

These are probably some of the best episode of the Friends series, in which you will find every character at his/her best. But heck, almost every episode is great. The series never get boring: from all of my DVD's, these are the ones that are played most often.

1925,1925,8.65,11 January 2003,Friends is a 30 min show about 6 Friends who live in the State of New York. Some are roomates or married. It basically shows their everyday life and events. I know many people say that the plots are irealistic. To begin with they are not THAT irealistic as many people make it seem. First of all it is possible for you and your friends to live in the same city or be roommates it is also possible in real life to get married as did Monica & Chandler or Rachel & Ross. And the past of each character adds a little something but are not impossible nor improbable. Ok! so on the show there not always at work but its showing the times there at home or hanging out.

1926,1926,8.65,30 January 2006,"Friends tells the story of a group of 6 people who are tied together by the force of friendship. Through their 10 year journey, they have filled our hearts with laughter, joy and sometimes even sadness. Even in some cultures where living separately from one's family is very uncommon, Friends has shown that it is not as hard as it sounds, and has even made me want to move out and live with my friends. The great storyline and the way everything just 'fits' it the best part of Friends. In some way at least one of the characters resembles you. The 6 goofy coffee house people live their life in the funniest manner, giving us faith and courage about living life single, and at the same time making us laugh. The sweetness of Rachael, motherness of Monica, crazy, hippy Phoebe, the sarcastic jokes of Chandler, the slow brain of Joey and geeky Ross, all make us understand the importance of friendship.

1931,1931,8.65,19 January 2004,"""Friends"" has been one of my all-time favorite shows. The writing has always been top notch, with equally top notch acting. The 6 actors lucky enough to be cast in this very funny show have done it well for 10 years. Kudos to Ellie Kanner for the initial casting of these fine comedic actors.

While I have enjoyed all of their performances, I must confess that Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc have been my absolute faves, with Courtney Cox-Arquette being my least favorite. I feel her talents lie not with comedy, per se, but rather within the dramatic realm. If Lisa Kudrow can keep her ""Phoebe"" character out of other roles (hasn't accomplished this yet), she will have a fine film career.

I must comment, though, that even though I've enjoyed the comedic talents of Aniston, et al and their talented writers and producers, I must not ignore my utter disappointment in the lack of guest-starring minorities in the 10 years it's been on the air. With the notable exceptions of the talented Gabrielle Union and the actress who played Joey-then-Ross' girlfriend in 2003, I was appalled at lack of ethnic minorities depicted on the show. One needs only to walk out onto the sidewalk in NY to witness the cultural diversity. Fans from other countries never having been in Manhattan surely might deduce that it is an all-white territory. I am continually bothered by Hollywood's erroneous depiction of how America is. Why is it that sitcoms always have either an all-white cast or an all-black cast? This is 2004 and people of all races co-mingle and co-exist everywhere. Except maybe in Montana, Utah, and places of similar demographic populations.

A-N-Y-W-A-Y, it's been a great 10 years. After a shaky first few episodes in '94-'95, ""Friends"" developed into one of the all-time greats. Great writers, producers, and actors all share credit for this enormously funny sitcom. I just hope that writers and producers in 2004 can create equally funny sitcom material that can be applied to another group of equally talented actors that displays diversity.

From Monica's high maintenance to Phoebe's weirdness, the producers of the show have done a good job to ensure Friends never fell into the hashed out old boring theme found in shows such as Mad About You and Suddenly Susan.

The main supporters of this show are evidently those who list their main asset as an unroadworthy RV and like their Raccoons well done. Perhaps it would be appropriate if Friends was to be relocated to a trailer park somewhere in the mid-West of the US.

1953,1953,8.65,18 December 2004,"The show 'Friends' is one of the most successful sitcoms the world has seen. It has an all star cast, and fantastic writers, the raw talent of the writers is unbelievable. it is rare to get so many jokes in one episode from a sitcom, but 'Friends' never fails to please. When people watch the show, they compare themselves with one of the characters, whether it be neurotic Monica or geeky Ross, either way they shine a light on the stereo typical people in the world, making them feel better about themselves. you can tell by watching the sitcom that there is a friendship outside the media bubble, and that on and off set, they will always be there for each other. this may sound like i am favouring Friends over other sitcoms but it is the most successful, because of the witty jokes that are put into the love factor. People always say that the 'Ross and Rachel' situation is too much for a sitcom, and that it shouldn't have gone on for so long, but they are the most famous couple in the television world. Even people who aren't so keen on the show always have a favourite character or episode, and i think that shows that the sitcom has such a big effect on the world. It draws you in and makes you believe that you could be a ""friend"".

With so many personalities in the show, it lets everyone have someone to compare to: Chandler-Witty, Ross-geeky, Joey-sweet but dumb, Monica- cleaning freak (has to be perfect), Rachel-prom queen /bimbo, Pheobe-blonde, individual the show wouldn't be here today without the creators David Crane, Marta Kauffman, and Kevin Bright. Lisa Kudrow quotes 'There would be no six of us without the three of them' and that hits the point head on, they have made sure that the writers are the best, and that the actors are like they are. they opened doors for these six actors, and have given them their futures, without Crane, Kauffman and Bright, they would probably be sat at home watching the show just like everyone of us, and wishing that they could play the part of their favourite character.

The only reason they got to play the parts of these characters is because of their own personalities, as that was the deciding point in the casting. So before people comment on the structure of 'Friends' i'd like them to put pen to paper and write a show as successful as it, then and just then can they make remarks on the show.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",the show friends is one of the most successful sitcoms the world has seen it has an all star cast and fantastic writers the raw talent of the writers is unbelievable it is rare to get so many jokes in one episode from a sitcom but friends never fails to please when people watch the show they compare themselves with one of the characters whether it be neurotic monica or geeky ross either way they shine a light on the stereo typical people in the world making them feel better about themselves you can tell by watching the sitcom that there is a friendship outside the media bubble and that on and off set they will always be there for each other this may sound like i am favouring friends over other sitcoms but it is the most successful because of the witty jokes that are put into the love factor people always say that the ross and rachel situation is too much for a sitcom and that it shouldnt have gone on for so long but they are the most famous couple in the television world even people who arent so keen on the show always have a favourite character or episode and i think that shows that the sitcom has such a big effect on the world it draws you in and makes you believe that you could be a friend with so many personalities in the show it lets everyone have someone to compare to chandlerwitty rossgeeky joeysweet but dumb monica cleaning freak has to be perfect rachelprom queen bimbo pheobeblonde individual the show wouldnt be here today without the creators david crane marta kauffman and kevin bright lisa kudrow quotes there would be no six of us without the three of them and that hits the point head on they have made sure that the writers are the best and that the actors are like they are they opened doors for these six actors and have given them their futures without crane kauffman and bright they would probably be sat at home watching the show just like everyone of us and wishing that they could play the part of their favourite character the only reason they got to play the parts of these characters is because of their own personalities as that was the deciding point in the casting so before people comment on the structure of friends id like them to put pen to paper and write a show as successful as it then and just then can they make remarks on the show,POSITIVE
1954,1954,8.65,25 May 2003,"I got into this show about 3 or 4 years ago and I was quickly hooked. It was always so refreshing and funny. I was so upset last year when they were thinking about ending it after 8 seasons, and I was at first very happy when the cast signed on for a 9th season. Yet I soon realized they should have ended it after season 8. There were a few funny moments this year, but most of it was just lame. The writers just really ran out of ideas. For example, the whole Ross and Rachel drama was funny the first MILLION times, but now after nine seasons there's still talk about whether or not they are going to get back together. And they have a baby together. And to add to that, Joey gets a crush on Rachel while she's pregnant with Ross' baby, but she doesn't like him....but then she does and they hook up! What is that? I'm tired of the show having the friends hooking up with each other and all these other crazy story lines. I can't even imagine what the tenth season is going to be like.

I have the first 3 seasons on DVD along with the 20 fan favorites. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND watching the older episodes. In fact, I think the show is great until Chandler and Monica get married. The show really should have ended then, but what show ever ends at its peak? Of course the producers are going to wait until it dries out its audience. Compare the first 3 seasons with the last couple seasons. The older episodes are much more enjoyable than the newer ones. It was great to watch the Friends grow and become successful, but it was just more funny when they were still struggling in their 20s. It's like a completely different show now that they are all in their 30s and have to settle down.

By contrast, in Friends, there was absolutely no mention of Joey moving to L.A. and nothing about Ross' kid Ben, just to name a few large loose ends. They should've spent less time on the Rachel-Ross simpering sessions, which got really annoying towards the end, and a tad more time tying everything up.

1960,1960,8.65,4 October 2001,"I would have to say ""Friends"" has long since crested it's appex. Last seasons shows were all devised as obvious attempts to steal ""Survivor's"" megalithic ratings. When a show can't gain ratings on it's own ( a lesbian college kiss between the ""Beatlegeuse"" girl and Jennifer Anistan Pitt, come on now that's straying far from the shows baseline stories ) is a sign of serious writers block in the shows creative team. Also, these ""Friends"" are really demanding when it comes to NBC dishing out the dough. Why should NBC pay them phenomenal paychecks when average sparingly-paid people living in the wild are wiping the floor with them on the other station? Rachael pregnant, Who's the father?

1961,1961,8.65,17 May 2003,"Why is it in America whenever something is great they have to ruin it? Songs on the radio that get played every 10 minutes, horrid movie sequels (Casablanca with Jlo????), and great tv shows that just don't know when to throw in the towel.

I realize that whether Friends is still good or bad is not the issue when it comes to business and advertising. As long as people still watch the show NBC can sell their advertising spots at a very high price. The quality of the show is not relevent. So sad.

When friends first aired and people started talking about it I refused to watch. I thought 6 pretty people who all are friends in NYC? Not interested. It was only by the 3rd or 4th season when it was still going strong that I decided to watch it. Much to my surprise it was hilarious! I was completely hooked. I was so glad that they put the reruns on other channels so I could see all the great stuff I missed.

It was a great ensemble cast. Often I pondered which charactor I liked the best and the least, while Ross always came up as the most annoying while discussing friends with anyone he actually was a very good charactor. They all had something about them that made them almost equally interesting and funny. I never was disappointed if they focused more on one charactor than another. I thought the show was very well acted and the actors had great comedic timing. I must say that throughout Chandler was probably the funniest and most adorable. This brings me to my point;

Friends ""jumped the shark"" a long time ago. I don't remember the exact moment, but Chandler and Monica, in my oppinion the worlds worst couple getting married? No, no no. Them dating was actally kinda cute, but them being married like on many other shows just killed the story line. Chandler was funny single, insecure guy who had a great personality but was clueless with women. Also, I realize that just by virtue of their age that him and Joey still living as roommates would seem unlikely, but them living together and the scenes with them were some of the funniest on the show. Monica was funny in her own way, but her and Chandler together killed the funniest parts of the both of them. Monica's neurosis's just got intensley annoying as she henpecked Chandler draining him of all his humor.

Ross and Rachel having a baby? Ok, I liked Ross and Rachel together. They were a great couple because they were so different. The geek and the prom queen. They had real chemistry, but now, years later when they had one last fling and she got knocked up? I always thought that they should end friends with Rachel and Ross falling for each other again and maybe end the series with their marriage, but that clearly won't happen again because as we see now their fling was a drunken meaningless one and now Rachel lives with Ross and all they do is annoy the crap out of each other becasue they both still want to date other people and now it's considered rude and insensitive.

This last episode reminded me of the last Seinfeld, which I hated, where they portayed the charactors in just the worst possible light. Phoebe's long lost lover comes back from Minsk and she reunites with him but is still in love with another guy, Mike. She keeps saying Mike when she's addressing David. How cruel and unlike her real charactor. It was terrible. I thought they could have summed Phoebe up by bringing her back with David who she seemed to truly love years back and was devastated that he had left.

Last but not least, Joey and Rachel.I must admit it was a little exciting to see them kiss and weird too, but the whole thing is just a little too incestuous. Rachel has a small baby from the former love of her life on a one night stand and now one of his best friends is gonna start something up with her? I realize stuff like this does actually happen,but it's a little pathetic and don't want to see it on a show I used to love.

1971,1971,8.65,11 July 2008,"Friends is hailed as one of the best sitcoms the '90s ever produced, and that high regard holds true years after it ended its phenomenal run. It is often considered a more universal show than others in its league. On the surface, it seems typical: a few locations the characters frequent, laugh track, situational irony. What differentiates the show, however, is very much its core idea - friendship against all odds. It may seem difficult to make such a concept as funny as it became in the hands of the creators, but the show manages with ease, even in the beginning when the group still seemed rough around the edges.

Almost right away, Friends adapted a strongly serialized format - creating story arcs that lasted for whole seasons, at times; references to past occurrences; continuing plot lines from one episode to the next, and from season to season. Though some might find this concept too soap opera-like, the main intention is clear: it mirrors real life. The show never tried to shove morals down viewers' throats, condescend to lowbrow humour, or be drastically different (and yet just by doing this, it was different).

Throughout the show's run, even though there were points where the quality dipped just a little, the writing and setup remained razor-sharp, something unexpected due to its nature. For many of the 'milestone' episodes, the show's original creators, David Crane and Marta Kauffman, would take over writing and remind us what made the characters so endearing, real, and hilarious. And that's where the real strength lies: The ensemble cast worked seamlessly together, never missing a beat from episode to episode. On their own, they could shine; but together, they took on a new concept. Some story lines broke them off into groups of two or three, and each character had a different dynamic with every other character, creating a complexity that, again, was unexpected.

But behind all this, the show had a wonderful simplicity. The characterizations could not be broken down easily, although each one had neuroses and real-life qualities, and they were all simply trying to get through life with each other's help. Along the way, four of the six eventually paired off within the group (Monica and Chandler about halfway through; Ross and Rachel, off-and-on throughout), and it only strengthened the bonds and the humour, rather than failing miserably, as it may have done in the hands of some. To quote a recent editorial on the best TV shows ever: It claimed to be about friends, but it was really about family.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is hailed as one of the best sitcoms the s ever produced and that high regard holds true years after it ended its phenomenal run it is often considered a more universal show than others in its league on the surface it seems typical a few locations the characters frequent laugh track situational irony what differentiates the show however is very much its core idea friendship against all odds it may seem difficult to make such a concept as funny as it became in the hands of the creators but the show manages with ease even in the beginning when the group still seemed rough around the edges almost right away friends adapted a strongly serialized format creating story arcs that lasted for whole seasons at times references to past occurrences continuing plot lines from one episode to the next and from season to season though some might find this concept too soap operalike the main intention is clear it mirrors real life the show never tried to shove morals down viewers throats condescend to lowbrow humour or be drastically different and yet just by doing this it was different throughout the shows run even though there were points where the quality dipped just a little the writing and setup remained razorsharp something unexpected due to its nature for many of the milestone episodes the shows original creators david crane and marta kauffman would take over writing and remind us what made the characters so endearing real and hilarious and thats where the real strength lies the ensemble cast worked seamlessly together never missing a beat from episode to episode on their own they could shine but together they took on a new concept some story lines broke them off into groups of two or three and each character had a different dynamic with every other character creating a complexity that again was unexpected but behind all this the show had a wonderful simplicity the characterizations could not be broken down easily although each one had neuroses and reallife qualities and they were all simply trying to get through life with each others help along the way four of the six eventually paired off within the group monica and chandler about halfway through ross and rachel offandon throughout and it only strengthened the bonds and the humour rather than failing miserably as it may have done in the hands of some to quote a recent editorial on the best tv shows ever it claimed to be about friends but it was really about family,POSITIVE

1979,1979,8.65,1 September 2004,"I recently started watching Friends. Its a bit weird that the first episode I saw was the finale, but once I saw it for the first time I knew it had a great history behind it. So I started watching season one and worked my way through the entire 10 years. I must say it is very easy to get addicted to it. What I enjoy watching most, is the trials and tribulations that go on between Ross and Rachel. I'm always eager to learn what happens to them in each season. Some people say that Friends was on television for too long. I strongly disagree, because It is a great show that people can relate to. Others say that they do not like how many of the friends get married, or how in the later seasons they get into more fights, etc. While some people think they should just go back to being friends, I say the writers of the show did the right thing. If they were just friends throughout the entire 10 years, it would get rather boring. Not to mention it is an example of real life; no group of friends stays perfectly fine forever. They are bound to have their fights, relationship crisis', etc. This just shows how life really is. What is so great about Friends is that it keeps you laughing constantly, and makes you cry when things don't work out between the characters. It has variety and thats what is so great about it.

What makes this show work is the chemistry between the characters and the actors who play them. Sure, the one liners, plots, and jokes are great, but it wouldn't be the same if there wasn't chemistry. Courteney Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc work together so well, so fluently, and so convincingly, that you start to really care about the characters. Their quirky habits walk the line between charming and annoying, but come out so much more charming because they're so relatable.

Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Green. Out of all the characters, I'd say she's changed the most. We saw her go from a prissy rich girl who just left a man at the altar and painfully cutting up her credit cards to a successful, confident, independent woman. Plus, she's got some great hair! ;) Courteney Cox-Arquette plays a formerly fat Monica Gellar, Ross' (Schwimmer) sister and now, Chandler's wife. She's a neat freak if there ever was one, and that's where many of her laughs come from. Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay (my personal fave), a ditzy but lovable folk singer and massuse. Her songs are hilarious (who can forget Smelly Cat?). David Schwimmer plays Ross- Monica's brother and the father of Rachel's baby (Emma). I feel he's been overlooked in the cast. He's a little geeky, a little dorky, but you've gotta love him. He's had three [failed] marriages (first wife- a lesbian, second- accidently said Rachel's name at the alter, thrid- he and Rachel got drunk in Vegas and eloped). He and Rachel have been the on again-off again- on a break couple of the show, and fans are rooting for them to be the next couple. Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing. His one liners are classic, and his sarcasm is hilarious. (Could he BE any funnier?) Matt LeBlanc is the aspiring (emphasize that word!) actor, who, like Phoebe, is a little ditzy and quite the womanizer. ;)

Friends has been able to take the usual sitcom plot and liven it up to make it something new and exciting, as well as come up with many plot twists and storylines of their own.

1988,1988,8.65,27 August 2001,"Although I admit I enjoy seeing Friends, I've got a problem with post-production and the backing laughs, which many times come on when nothing funny has actually been said. Can't the staff do better and keep them in a low profile or just drop them? Anyway, this is a problem common to all sitcoms.

As other people have commented here, it's time to put an end to Friends. Why? Simple. The cast is not in their late-twenties anymore and is getting OUTRAGEOUS amounts of money for what they do. Add to this the fact that the writers seem to have squeezed their brains dry looking for decent plots and these are getting dull and weak. For instance, why did they need to bring Winona Ryder to kiss Jennifer Aniston? Was that intended to gain some audience who prefers ""Survivor""? If a sitcom gets to the point of including a lesbian kiss to attract potential viewers it only proves the show is running out of ideas.

Eight years is too much time for any TV show, so the smartest decision (In artistic terms, of course) would be to call it quits now, before Friends dies from lack of inspiration and greed from the actors. Many sitcoms have made the same mistake before: going on and on until becoming rubbish, and sadly that's how they're remembered (Seinfeld comes to mind).

It's actually curious how little success most of the Friends cast has achieved elsewhere. Maybe Courtney Cox has been the luckiest one, in lousy horror movies like Scream, but most of the rest haven't been very wise choosing acting roles in movies (At least regarding quality).

Friends first season was weak and little funny. The second season was better, so they were the third and the fourth, and the fifth was the best season ever, probably due to the Chandler/Monica secret affair. Even after being discovered by their pals (Hysterical that episode, as a matter of fact) kept being amusing. Early series 6 lived up to expectations, but was slowly losing interest. I can't say a lot about the seventh season, since I live in a country where it hasn't been aired yet but (According to people who have seen it), the downhill slide has continued. And now they're about to start series 8. I wonder what the writers will come up with, after the wedding. Are they planning to make the still single foursome tie the knot as well? Who knows?

One may complain that Friends is a show full of cute faces and that is not realistic (Even I say that myself), but the problem is that's what the bulk of the audience wants to see, whether we like it or not.

Rating: 7/10.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",although i admit i enjoy seeing friends ive got a problem with postproduction and the backing laughs which many times come on when nothing funny has actually been said cant the staff do better and keep them in a low profile or just drop them anyway this is a problem common to all sitcoms as other people have commented here its time to put an end to friends why simple the cast is not in their latetwenties anymore and is getting outrageous amounts of money for what they do add to this the fact that the writers seem to have squeezed their brains dry looking for decent plots and these are getting dull and weak for instance why did they need to bring winona ryder to kiss jennifer aniston was that intended to gain some audience who prefers survivor if a sitcom gets to the point of including a lesbian kiss to attract potential viewers it only proves the show is running out of ideas eight years is too much time for any tv show so the smartest decision in artistic terms of course would be to call it quits now before friends dies from lack of inspiration and greed from the actors many sitcoms have made the same mistake before going on and on until becoming rubbish and sadly thats how theyre remembered seinfeld comes to mind its actually curious how little success most of the friends cast has achieved elsewhere maybe courtney cox has been the luckiest one in lousy horror movies like scream but most of the rest havent been very wise choosing acting roles in movies at least regarding quality friends first season was weak and little funny the second season was better so they were the third and the fourth and the fifth was the best season ever probably due to the chandlermonica secret affair even after being discovered by their pals hysterical that episode as a matter of fact kept being amusing early series lived up to expectations but was slowly losing interest i cant say a lot about the seventh season since i live in a country where it hasnt been aired yet but according to people who have seen it the downhill slide has continued and now theyre about to start series i wonder what the writers will come up with after the wedding are they planning to make the still single foursome tie the knot as well who knows one may complain that friends is a show full of cute faces and that is not realistic even i say that myself but the problem is thats what the bulk of the audience wants to see whether we like it or not rating,NEGATIVE
1990,1990,8.65,6 April 2009,Friends is a great show that deals with many different issues. I particularly took interest in the episode involving Phoebe when she decided to donate the use of her uterus to house embryos for a couple that could not have children without the help of Phoebe. This episode really stood out because it showed that there are couples who have realistic dreams that they are not able to fulfill on their own. This deals with science and the ability to create embryos without sexual activity. This episode shows why such practices should continue to be legal and the positive effects that it has on many couples in the world today. The positives of such practices seem to far outweigh the negatives such as a story that has been in the news recently. Apparently there is a woman who has been fertilized twice through in vitro fertilization and now has 14 children and no father for any of them. This is a rare case and should not be the basis of an argument against this technology.,"September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is a great show that deals with many different issues i particularly took interest in the episode involving phoebe when she decided to donate the use of her uterus to house embryos for a couple that could not have children without the help of phoebe this episode really stood out because it showed that there are couples who have realistic dreams that they are not able to fulfill on their own this deals with science and the ability to create embryos without sexual activity this episode shows why such practices should continue to be legal and the positive effects that it has on many couples in the world today the positives of such practices seem to far outweigh the negatives such as a story that has been in the news recently apparently there is a woman who has been fertilized twice through in vitro fertilization and now has children and no father for any of them this is a rare case and should not be the basis of an argument against this technology,POSITIVE

1992,1992,8.65,15 October 2000,"When I was young (and still living in LA) I liked shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie (which I still love). I also liked all those animated cartoons (Which I now don't, with the exception of those made for more mature audiences such as Daria and Dilbert). But the first ever show in my mature life that I LOVED was Friends. I first got into it when all the 'grown-ups' of my family one night watched Friends and Seinfeld. I wasn't too impressed with Seinfeld (which I now love as mush as Friends) but I did love Friends. Seinfeld is hilariously funny but the jokes are more sophisticated and can be understood much more by adults or teenagers than young kids. Friends (whilst having it's share of sex and political jokes) can be liked by kids of younger ages as a lot of jokes are simpler or more visual. I still get a kick of watching all the old episodes I watched when I was young, I didn't understand so many jokes then or mistook them for other meanings and I now go ""Of course! How could I have missed that?"".

The cast is great. I don't know why so many people keep attacking Monica, I actually like her a lot. My favorite character no doubt has to be Phoebe (played by the hilarious Lisa Kudrow, who could have potential movie talent which she wasted on movies with no potential but she is climbing up since Analyze This). Phoebe is the very zany, spiritual, not very knowledgeable woman who can also remember stuff from her past lives. Chandler (played by Matthew Perry, who like Lisa did stupid movies until The Whole Nine Yards proved to be funny and successful) is the cynical, sarcastic guy who makes most inside jokes and whose job is a mystery to all. Monica (played by Courteney Cox, now with the addition of Arquette to the name. Courteney probably proved to be most successful on the big screen with the Scream trilogy) is the cleaning-freak, tidy, neurotic of the gang. Chandler and Monica make a great couple. Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc whose only movie worth mentioning is Lost in Space) is the dumbest guy in the group (every group has one). Rachel (played by Jennifer Aniston, who's movies are all rather stupid and is now married to Brad Pitt) is the spoiled one from the rich background who loves shopping. Ross (played by David Schwimmer, who has made some pretty stupid movies, including one he made with his Israeli actress wife, Mili Avital) is the geeky scientist guy who has been married three times- four years to the mother of his child who turned out to be a lesbian, for a split second with Emily, who oops instead of saying her name at the ceremony said Rachel's'- who he married out of drunkenness in Vegas.

Friends is not as funny as it was in the first four seasons but it is still very enjoyable and worth watching. Ross and Rachel are kinda getting on my nerves always leading us to believe they're on again, then off. And Ross is just getting way too whiny. But I love Friends, and I don't see how anybody can hate it- these are just anti people. Friends is un-hatable, you may not like it, but I don't see how you can hate it.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",when i was young and still living in la i liked shows like bewitched and i dream of jeannie which i still love i also liked all those animated cartoons which i now dont with the exception of those made for more mature audiences such as daria and dilbert but the first ever show in my mature life that i loved was friends i first got into it when all the grownups of my family one night watched friends and seinfeld i wasnt too impressed with seinfeld which i now love as mush as friends but i did love friends seinfeld is hilariously funny but the jokes are more sophisticated and can be understood much more by adults or teenagers than young kids friends whilst having its share of sex and political jokes can be liked by kids of younger ages as a lot of jokes are simpler or more visual i still get a kick of watching all the old episodes i watched when i was young i didnt understand so many jokes then or mistook them for other meanings and i now go of course how could i have missed that the cast is great i dont know why so many people keep attacking monica i actually like her a lot my favorite character no doubt has to be phoebe played by the hilarious lisa kudrow who could have potential movie talent which she wasted on movies with no potential but she is climbing up since analyze this phoebe is the very zany spiritual not very knowledgeable woman who can also remember stuff from her past lives chandler played by matthew perry who like lisa did stupid movies until the whole nine yards proved to be funny and successful is the cynical sarcastic guy who makes most inside jokes and whose job is a mystery to all monica played by courteney cox now with the addition of arquette to the name courteney probably proved to be most successful on the big screen with the scream trilogy is the cleaningfreak tidy neurotic of the gang chandler and monica make a great couple joey played by matt leblanc whose only movie worth mentioning is lost in space is the dumbest guy in the group every group has one rachel played by jennifer aniston whos movies are all rather stupid and is now married to brad pitt is the spoiled one from the rich background who loves shopping ross played by david schwimmer who has made some pretty stupid movies including one he made with his israeli actress wife mili avital is the geeky scientist guy who has been married three times four years to the mother of his child who turned out to be a lesbian for a split second with emily who oops instead of saying her name at the ceremony said rachels who he married out of drunkenness in vegas friends is not as funny as it was in the first four seasons but it is still very enjoyable and worth watching ross and rachel are kinda getting on my nerves always leading us to believe theyre on again then off and ross is just getting way too whiny but i love friends and i dont see how anybody can hate it these are just anti people friends is unhatable you may not like it but i dont see how you can hate it,POSITIVE

1994,1994,8.65,5 November 2005,"I have watched many TV shows out there, but none of them compare to how great Friends is. Friends isn't just about having friends, but it's about sharing memories together and having fun times.

The best part, in my opinion, about Friends, is the very last episode of the 10th season. It's really suspenseful and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's also sad at the same time, but I won't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't watched the final episode yet.

I like Monica the best because she's really organized, although sometimes she can be very competitive, but she's a really great character.

What I find weird about Joey is that sometimes, he knows a lot, but other times, he's really stupid; for example, he can't add simple addition in his head, but another time, he can do 100 minus 3. He's a pretty funny character, though.

Rachel is the whiniest character, but it's really hilarious when she whines. It's so real.

Ross is such a nerd! It seems weird that such a cool person like Rachel would fall for him, but that's part of how funny this is! Ross is really funny in his own special way.

Phoebe is one of those characters who is really funny and pretty brilliant as well. She's a great character.

Chandler Bing. Wow. He's a real joker and I think he and Monica go great together.

I wish Friends went on for more than 10 seasons, but oh well.

1995,1995,8.65,21 May 2000,"I loved Friends during its initial four seasons. The actors were brilliant. The writing was perfect and true to the show's premise. It was the best comedy of the 90's.

Unfortunately these last two seasons were completely messed up. With Seinfeld's departure, Friends became more of a Seinfeld than a standout comedy about young people attempting to live their lives independently.

I no longer like Phoebe. She was fantastic from the Pilot to her giving birth to her brother's triplets. But afterwards, she became a stupid character, unfriendly, selfish. It's not the free-spirited Phoebe I once knew and loved.

These six young people no longer act like Friends. The writing changed completely. What happened to Ross & Rachel? When did Rachel stop loving Ross? We never see Ross's son anymore. Monica & Chandler are the most boring couple I've ever seen. We hardly see them together. They don't have any chemistry like Ross & Rachel had.

The stories used to be dramatic and character-based. They grew and learned from their actions. Recently, there's been no dramatic development on Friends. Instead, awful episodes like the Unagi episode (which doesn't make any sense in the overall storyline) went on air.

I hope Friends gets back on track next season developing its characters in realistic ways as it used to. I want this show back to the glory it was held for four seasons, instead of becoming another dumb sitcom of the 90's like Seinfeld.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i loved friends during its initial four seasons the actors were brilliant the writing was perfect and true to the shows premise it was the best comedy of the s unfortunately these last two seasons were completely messed up with seinfelds departure friends became more of a seinfeld than a standout comedy about young people attempting to live their lives independently i no longer like phoebe she was fantastic from the pilot to her giving birth to her brothers triplets but afterwards she became a stupid character unfriendly selfish its not the freespirited phoebe i once knew and loved these six young people no longer act like friends the writing changed completely what happened to ross rachel when did rachel stop loving ross we never see rosss son anymore monica chandler are the most boring couple ive ever seen we hardly see them together they dont have any chemistry like ross rachel had the stories used to be dramatic and characterbased they grew and learned from their actions recently theres been no dramatic development on friends instead awful episodes like the unagi episode which doesnt make any sense in the overall storyline went on air i hope friends gets back on track next season developing its characters in realistic ways as it used to i want this show back to the glory it was held for four seasons instead of becoming another dumb sitcom of the s like seinfeld,NEGATIVE

2023,2023,8.65,22 April 2000,"I have to admit that I was not a fan of Friends at all until very recently. The show first debuted in 1994, and at that time, I was still bemoaning the loss of Saved by the Bell, the show that I had watched all throughout my formative years. Quite frankly, Friends didn't strike my fancy at all. I began watching Friends periodically in the Spring 1998, but a busy schedule forced me to put the show on hiatus until late last year. Now, after having caught up on virtually every single episode, I am hopelessly HOOKED. Friends has become a part of my daily schedule (hey, re-runs are not all bad, LOL), just as Jeopardy was, and is. The storylines are clever and witty, and the manner in which the producers have chosen to title each episode suggests a certain creativity and boldness that, to my knowledge, has never been tested before.

As far as the six characters go, they are, in my opinion, mutually complementary; that is, that it is the group dynamics that give the characters their charm and appeal because admittedly, it would be very unlikely that I would be able to last 10 minutes alone with any one of the characters. (I suppose, however, that that is the way it is with most television shows.) While some of the characters appear to be notoriously indolent, the lives that they live are gloriously appealing.

2029,2029,8.65,20 April 2004,"Friends is finally almost at an end after ten years, and for a lot of people, this ending is going to be too difficult for words. I think I am one of those people. It's hard to describe why I love Friends so much, and why its ending is going to be so upsetting-it's only a TV show! But ever since I was twelve years old and I made the effort to watch the premiere of Series 2 to see what all the fuss was about, I have been hooked beyond words. Rachel was going to the airport to tell Ross she wanted to be with him, but he was getting off the plane with Julie. I hadn't seen one episode of the first series, I didn't have any idea of the build up to this moment-Ross' infatuation with Rachel for an entire series was nothing to me. I didn't have a clue. But I knew that I cared. And for me to be so involved within two minutes of watching tells me Friends must be something special. And it is.

At the time, I loved Frasier too. Everyone was talking about Niles and his love for Daphne, but I never cared about that half as much as I did Ross and Rachel, even in those two minutes. I think one of the reasons for this is just the realism of the characters. To me, as great as it was, Frasier was a show of caricatures. Friends was about real people, with the possible exception of Phoebe. Phoebe is probably the character with the least depth, despite the fact that she has the most interesting background (her mother killed herself, she lived on the streets). But it's easy to get the feeling that the whole character, background and all, was originally designed for cheap laughs. It's only in the last two seasons that Phoebe has been given a real relationship, and her forays into meaningful storylines have been erratic, which is a shame, because the emotional Phoebe moments have always been my favourites. Whilst her lines are funny, she is deeply unconvincing as a character at times. However, all of the other characters are identifiable, with many of the same problems that we face.

Even as the episodic storylines have become rather more unbelievable in the last couple of years, the characters have stayed constant and for a sitcom, it has had it's true dramatic and emotional moments. In Season Nine, Monica and Chandler discovered they were unable to conceive. That's pretty heavy stuff for a sitcom, but Friends was never afraid to head into these topics. Emotion and comedy has rarely gone so well together.

Friends has made me laugh out loud and cry into my pillow. It has never failed to lift me up after a bad day. I have every single episode on DVD, and I must have seen them all at least ten times but I don't stop enjoying them and I don't believe I ever will. Friends has something magic about it and I don't know if I will ever put my finger on what that is exactly, but I know I will always appreciate it for being there and making me smile.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",friends is finally almost at an end after ten years and for a lot of people this ending is going to be too difficult for words i think i am one of those people its hard to describe why i love friends so much and why its ending is going to be so upsettingits only a tv show but ever since i was twelve years old and i made the effort to watch the premiere of series to see what all the fuss was about i have been hooked beyond words rachel was going to the airport to tell ross she wanted to be with him but he was getting off the plane with julie i hadnt seen one episode of the first series i didnt have any idea of the build up to this momentross infatuation with rachel for an entire series was nothing to me i didnt have a clue but i knew that i cared and for me to be so involved within two minutes of watching tells me friends must be something special and it is at the time i loved frasier too everyone was talking about niles and his love for daphne but i never cared about that half as much as i did ross and rachel even in those two minutes i think one of the reasons for this is just the realism of the characters to me as great as it was frasier was a show of caricatures friends was about real people with the possible exception of phoebe phoebe is probably the character with the least depth despite the fact that she has the most interesting background her mother killed herself she lived on the streets but its easy to get the feeling that the whole character background and all was originally designed for cheap laughs its only in the last two seasons that phoebe has been given a real relationship and her forays into meaningful storylines have been erratic which is a shame because the emotional phoebe moments have always been my favourites whilst her lines are funny she is deeply unconvincing as a character at times however all of the other characters are identifiable with many of the same problems that we face even as the episodic storylines have become rather more unbelievable in the last couple of years the characters have stayed constant and for a sitcom it has had its true dramatic and emotional moments in season nine monica and chandler discovered they were unable to conceive thats pretty heavy stuff for a sitcom but friends was never afraid to head into these topics emotion and comedy has rarely gone so well together friends has made me laugh out loud and cry into my pillow it has never failed to lift me up after a bad day i have every single episode on dvd and i must have seen them all at least ten times but i dont stop enjoying them and i dont believe i ever will friends has something magic about it and i dont know if i will ever put my finger on what that is exactly but i know i will always appreciate it for being there and making me smile,POSITIVE
2030,2030,8.65,12 December 2005,"What can I say about a great show, that lasted 10 years, won tons of awards, over 55 of them, had a great cast, great plot, great lines? Well, I'd say that sums up ""Friends"" perfectly. ""Friends"" was a great show, so great that a lot of people were devastated when we heard the news, that it had come to an end, including me. I loved ""Friends"" and still do, like I said before the cast is brilliant, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, David Schwimmer, Courtney Cox-Arquette and of course one of my favourites Jennifer Aniston.

I remember watching the pilot, and I thought it was so funny, don't ask me what my favourite line or favourite moment was, because there are too many of them. Even now that it's over, lot's of people ask me what was my favourite moment, I just smile and say, I don't have near enough fingers to count them.

The concept was there's 6 people who are friends, hence the name of the show, and they all live in New York. They all get together every day at the local coffee shop, Central Perk, and talk about there day, and there relationships, basically there life. The neat part is with some shows you watch it, and you feel like your watching a show, but with me and lot's of other people, when you watch the show you actually feel like your watching your friends on TV, kind of like a home movie.

Who's my favourite ""Friend""? Well, that would have to Phoebe (played by the hilarious Lisa Kudrow), she was my favourite ""Friend"" and still is. I love Phoebe and lot's of people say I'm kind of like her. I guess it's in the ways we think, and were very open-minded, although I'm not a vegetarian. Jennifer Aniston though would have to be the best actor on the show, she plays Rachel Green, who has had lot's of relationships, she's been married I think 2 or 3 times to Ross Gellar (David Schwimmer). She played Rachel to a T, she was very funny and very enthusiastic. Than there's Monica Gellar (Ross' sister) who's played by the hilarious Courtney Cox-Arquette, Monica is a woman who is very, very clean and organized, kind of the opposite of me, however, all 3 are willing to lend a hand and keep an eye on the guys.

Which brings me to Joey, Chandler and Ross (LeBlanc, Perry and Schwimmer), all 3 of the guys are hilarious, they too have had there share of relationships, and get a lot of funny lines and sometimes don't always get each other's jokes. Joey would have to be my favourite guy, you've probably seen him in the show, ""Joey"", which is a spin-off of ""Friends"".

Anyways, the reason why I wish my friends were more like the cast is because the ""Friends"" on TV are more funnier, always willing to lend a hand, and they all work together kind of like a family. Whether it's through deaths, births of marriages the ""Friends"" are always there. I remember sharing countless laughs and quoting lines, and trust me, there's no show that's going to top this one.

So, to conclude, it was a great show, I still love watching re-runs and laughing at things that I've laughed at before. I'm gonna miss this show, it was really, really great, if I had the choice, I would give it 100 out of 10, but I can't so I'm gonna have to give it a 10, which sucks, because it should deserve a heck of a lot more.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",what can i say about a great show that lasted years won tons of awards over of them had a great cast great plot great lines well id say that sums up friends perfectly friends was a great show so great that a lot of people were devastated when we heard the news that it had come to an end including me i loved friends and still do like i said before the cast is brilliant lisa kudrow matt leblanc matthew perry david schwimmer courtney coxarquette and of course one of my favourites jennifer aniston i remember watching the pilot and i thought it was so funny dont ask me what my favourite line or favourite moment was because there are too many of them even now that its over lots of people ask me what was my favourite moment i just smile and say i dont have near enough fingers to count them the concept was theres people who are friends hence the name of the show and they all live in new york they all get together every day at the local coffee shop central perk and talk about there day and there relationships basically there life the neat part is with some shows you watch it and you feel like your watching a show but with me and lots of other people when you watch the show you actually feel like your watching your friends on tv kind of like a home movie whos my favourite friend well that would have to phoebe played by the hilarious lisa kudrow she was my favourite friend and still is i love phoebe and lots of people say im kind of like her i guess its in the ways we think and were very openminded although im not a vegetarian jennifer aniston though would have to be the best actor on the show she plays rachel green who has had lots of relationships shes been married i think or times to ross gellar david schwimmer she played rachel to a t she was very funny and very enthusiastic than theres monica gellar ross sister whos played by the hilarious courtney coxarquette monica is a woman who is very very clean and organized kind of the opposite of me however all are willing to lend a hand and keep an eye on the guys which brings me to joey chandler and ross leblanc perry and schwimmer all of the guys are hilarious they too have had there share of relationships and get a lot of funny lines and sometimes dont always get each others jokes joey would have to be my favourite guy youve probably seen him in the show joey which is a spinoff of friends anyways the reason why i wish my friends were more like the cast is because the friends on tv are more funnier always willing to lend a hand and they all work together kind of like a family whether its through deaths births of marriages the friends are always there i remember sharing countless laughs and quoting lines and trust me theres no show thats going to top this one so to conclude it was a great show i still love watching reruns and laughing at things that ive laughed at before im gonna miss this show it was really really great if i had the choice i would give it out of but i cant so im gonna have to give it a which sucks because it should deserve a heck of a lot more,POSITIVE

The first few years brought a new approach to an old formula and although it borrowed heavily from previous shows like Cheers and Taxi, it still seemed to have a unique quality. But now, as the television is littered with sitcoms, Friends has become very formulaic and predictable with no real development in the characters. The earlier years when the series was developing to extice larger audiences and when it was trying to impress were the years it did impress. Now, it seems as if the cast of friends turn up to make the fans happy which generally means that there are no surpises and the programme simply becomes repettitive. Once, where friends reined as its markets niche, it seems to inspire more poor quality, unimaginative sitcoms.

We knew about it; we'd read about it; we knew almost exactly what was going to happen; but still we were kept on the edges of our seats.

And there's a nice twist the producers put on the whole thing in the final moments. No giving away anything here, but it is good, it is fun, and it's very nostalgic.

Thanks to everyone working on this series. This is television when it works well like it always should. Thank you for ten years.

2036,2036,8.65,8 March 2002,"Running in its 8th season Friends is now better than ever. An average of almost 30 million viewers (in America only) tune in to Friends every Thursday evening. Why you ask?

Because Friends has a quality that only a few sit-coms in history has possessed; Universal humor mixed with a gang of sweet, relatable characters portrayed by 6 great actors. Everybody in their right mind would want Friends like these! And why, you ask again?

Because these Friends are extremely entertaining, funny, good-lookin' (without being glamorous) but most of all because these Friends are there for you when it really counts.

What makes this sit-com stand out from all the rest (besides all of the above-mentioned!) is a strong crew of writers, producers and directors. Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin S. Bright - the original creators/executive producers of Friends - have done a great job putting everything together.

2037,2037,8.65,6 May 2004,"I guess 10 years have finally come and gone. I have been a fan of this show over the years. I have gone my times where I hadn't followed the series as close as other times, but it always made me laugh. The show is just funny. As I said in my ""Seinfeld"" post, I am not here to debate which show was better. They both did a fine job.

Friends also contributed its fair share of catch phrases and added the greatness of six really funny characters. Each character had their own thing, which made them stand-alone. I just loved the situations these characters found themselves in. Ross, Chandler, and Rachel were my favorites on the show. Ross and Chandler were really funny. Chandler was funny because of his wise remarks and Ross for being neurotic. Rachel was just super hot. :) The rest of the cast was funny too. I wasn't as into the stupid and hippie characters, but they also worked well. There were allot of memorable episodes and I will continue to enjoy them in syndication.

The show ended as well as it could of. Really now, its hard to end a show after this long on the best note. There will always be what if we did this or that. Just look at it as a whole and you know it ended right, it couldn't of ended any other way.

2039,2039,8.65,8 April 2004,"When I first heard that ""Friends"" was goin' off the air, I cried. ""Friends"" first started out as a comedy, but over the 10 years that it's been on the air, it has turned into not only a comedy, but a drama as well. It has been a show that has touched people in a way, that no other show has. Everytime I watch the show, I don't feel like i'm watching a sitcom, I feel like i'm watchin' my friends in a home movie. The cast is phenomenal, they couldn't have picked a better group of actors to play the characters. Lisa Kudrow plays Phoebe Buffay on the show, Phoebe is a great character, she's kind of flighty, but she is very very funny. She's the kind of girl where if your having a bad day, you can just look or talk to her, and she'll make your day happy again. Courtney Cox Arquette plays Monica Gellar, Monica is a neat freak. She's VERY organized, she's the kind of girl that will make you a chocolate pie just because your feeling down. Jennifer Aniston plays Rachel Greene, Rachel is your average girl, she's funny, loves to talk, and wants to be a good friend. The girls are one of the best parts on the show, because there typical girls, who are great, the all love to talk, and make eachothers days feel a lot better.

Than there's the guy who like to have fun too. Matthew Perry plays Chandler Bing, a guy who thinks he's the funniest guy in the world, but some people think otherwise. Chandler got married to Monica on the end of the 8th season. David Schwimmer plays Ross Gellar, (Monica's brother, and the father of Rachel's daughter Emma). Ross is a nice guy, who likes to party, he thinks he's the coolest guy in the world, and well, I don't think he's that cool, but he's still funny. My favourite character i've chosen to save for last, because I think he's the best, Matt LeBlanc plays Joey Tribiani. Joey is the kind of guy that will do anything to get a laugh, and he's very very very funny. He's like Phoebe only male. He's a great friend, and his lines are HILARIOUS. I remember in one of the episodes he's doing an interview for ""Soap Opera digest"", and he's telling the interviewer, all about how he has great friends, and the interview is going very well, than the interviewer asks him a question: ""What is your favourite soap opera?"", and Joey says, ""O, I don't watch Soap Operas, I have a life"" or something like that, and it is sooo funny. You had to have been there. Meanwhile Joey's played Drake Ramoray on ""Days of Our Lives"", a popular soap opera.

The show is great. The characters phenomenal. The times that we, the audience, have shared with them are memories that will last a life time. The show draws you in, it makes you feel as if your one of the character's friends, and not just one of the show's viewers. All in all, I give the show infinity out of 10, because it is the best television show EVER.

2040,2040,8.65,28 March 2003,"When I was about to see the show Friends for the first time two years ago, I was skeptical because my expectations were so high. All of my friends were encouraging me to see it, saying ""Ohmigod, you haven't seen Friends?!"", so I gave in and watched an episode.

I had to admit that it was definitely well written, well acted, and always had an episode of interest that a teen/adult could relate to, and unlike most sitcoms, each episode has something different and new to offer (like a guest star, etc.).

After one episode I was hooked, the show just draws you in, mostly because the characters are so darn cute and likable. Monica (Courteney Cox Arquette), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), Ross (David Schwimmer), Chandler (Matthew Perry), and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) are hilarious, fun, and enjoyable to watch.

Each character has a certain characteristic about them such as: Monica-neurotic neat-freak, Rachel-sweetie, Chandler-smart funny, Ross-cute brainer, and Joey and Phoebe are the ditzy big kids.

The group of six live in New York and spend their 30-something lifestyles filled with ups and downs involving love, loss, and friendship.

Starring: David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Kudrow, and Courtney Cox.

Six people (three men and three women) living in New York have funny plots unfold in their lives. This show *was* my favorite show of all time. *But*, it fell down. There are some unforgivable flaws that I can't seem to forget. The characters, for example, are all slightly flawed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rachel, what a b*tch. She always has to get what she wants. I have three perfect examples. 1) Julie was Ross's love. Ross loved her a lot, and in my opinion, they could've ended up together. But no, Rachel has to barge in the relationship and steal Ross from Julie. 2) I forgot the characters name, but Christine Taylor. Ross was dating her and really liked her. Then Rachel tells her to shave her head bald and steal Ross from her. 3) Emily was going to marry Ross. Ross loved her very much. Then Rachel goes over there to stop the wedding and makes Ross say the wrong name (and ruin the marriage). I can't help but disliking her.

Monica was great. Then she started talking and it was over.

Pheobe was hilarious. Then she got ditzier and ditzier. She's also a b*tch. She's so mean to everyone at times.

Chandler was my favorite character. His witty and sarcastic remarks made him hysterical. Then he fell in love with Monica.

Ross is a geeky guy, but still funny. Then he fell in love with Rachel.

Joey has very little flaws about him. He is my favorite character.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

""Friends"" is an excellent show, but the many flaws made it bad for me.

2050,2050,8.65,10 February 2001,"Like I said, I enjoy watching Friends. It's one of the few sitcoms that I can watch these days. But now, from a recent episode, it appears as though NBC may trying to turn back the clock.

From a recent episode, Rachel turned thirty years old, yet it was my impression that these people had turned thirty a few years ago. It almost appears as though NBC may be trying to turn back the clock to keep the show's younger audience interested, when in fact the majority of the actors are in their mid- to later-thirties.

I will continue watching the show because I still find it to be quite funny, but I do not like it when these ""higher powers"" begin to re-write the show and change the ""facts"" just to keep their ratings up.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",like i said i enjoy watching friends its one of the few sitcoms that i can watch these days but now from a recent episode it appears as though nbc may trying to turn back the clock from a recent episode rachel turned thirty years old yet it was my impression that these people had turned thirty a few years ago it almost appears as though nbc may be trying to turn back the clock to keep the shows younger audience interested when in fact the majority of the actors are in their mid to laterthirties i will continue watching the show because i still find it to be quite funny but i do not like it when these higher powers begin to rewrite the show and change the facts just to keep their ratings up,POSITIVE

2052,2052,8.65,1 August 2003,"I have been watching Friends for as long as I can remember. I think the first episode I ever saw was 'The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy', and I thought it was hilarious. But I wont go into that right now.

After years and years of watching a sitcom, you really feel like you know the characters, and you even pick up on little habits and things that they do. I agree that maybe it *is* starting to wear a bit thin - the actors are almost into their fortys now, aren't they? But still, it had a good run, and I have the entire Friends collection on video, so marathons are a sure thing!

I guess the only things that could possibly annoy me about Friends is the fact that no matter what, no matter how long it takes for them, each one of them ALWAYS ends up with the girl/ guy they have been after. Always. Even if it only lasts a week or an hour, they get them eventually. I don't know if that *does* happen for everyone, but it doesn't seem realistic. Also, is anyone else getting a bit tired of the whole 'Ross and Rachel' thing? I don't know about you, but sometimes I wonder what the hell they see in each other, when they start to annoy me. But that has gone on for far too long, and they should get over each other and find other people. Anyway, I am really not criticising (much) - it's just something I noticed.

Anyway, bottom line is, Friends is THE best comedy sitcom on TV (along with The Simpsons), but I don't think I will be surprised or even sad if 10 is their last season, as it has to end eventually, and I think the timing is perfect.","September 22, 1994 (United States)",i have been watching friends for as long as i can remember i think the first episode i ever saw was the one with the princess leia fantasy and i thought it was hilarious but i wont go into that right now after years and years of watching a sitcom you really feel like you know the characters and you even pick up on little habits and things that they do i agree that maybe it is starting to wear a bit thin the actors are almost into their fortys now arent they but still it had a good run and i have the entire friends collection on video so marathons are a sure thing i guess the only things that could possibly annoy me about friends is the fact that no matter what no matter how long it takes for them each one of them always ends up with the girl guy they have been after always even if it only lasts a week or an hour they get them eventually i dont know if that does happen for everyone but it doesnt seem realistic also is anyone else getting a bit tired of the whole ross and rachel thing i dont know about you but sometimes i wonder what the hell they see in each other when they start to annoy me but that has gone on for far too long and they should get over each other and find other people anyway i am really not criticising much its just something i noticed anyway bottom line is friends is the best comedy sitcom on tv along with the simpsons but i dont think i will be surprised or even sad if is their last season as it has to end eventually and i think the timing is perfect,POSITIVE

What I also love about this show is its ability to portray hilarity one minute, and then the next, complicated emotional issues right to-the-point. With excellent scripts, and fine, precise acting, 'Friends' is about as good as it gets.
