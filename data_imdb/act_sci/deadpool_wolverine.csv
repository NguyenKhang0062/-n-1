0,9.0,25-Jul-24,"Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. What a fun movie. I like the dialogue and clever quips with f bombs sprinkled in. It's definitely not taking itself too seriously. There is tons of fun cameos I didn't expect! I normally watch spoiler videos ahead of time, but I didn't on this occasion and I'm glad I didn't because there was some oh snap moments! It's a very good action packed fun film. The breaking the Fox jokes and speaking to the camera jokes are too funny. I can definitely see more sequels for these two on the horizon. They are promoting this movie hard I just watched these two on Hot Ones eating chicken wings They make a dynamic duo. Until your 90 Wolverine ...until your 90 lol.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1,9.0,24-Jul-24,"What a crazy blast ! Bonkers !!Sooo !... What I can say about this movie is that they (the whole team behind the movie) never hesitated a second to go all in, with everything they have in stores, throwing the kitchen sink in there and everything else.What's to love is how highly satisfying the movie is from the very first to the very last second, when it comes to all the little (or not so little) winks at the audience, especially if you connect with the characters and their previous iterations...But what you can really appreciate and which makes the entire movie (and scenes / story bits) more enjoyable is the whole emotional layer of it and really fun connections that occur (the come-back or introduction of various characters was so well done and really great to see) ...These guys clearly know what they are doing.Between the one-liners and the endless flow of jokes... The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman knocks it out of the park !It is so overflowingly cray-cray and the frame is oh so overfilled with stuffs...Oh, and the tone of the movie is something else !The intro sequence is a masterpiece... The ""corridor"" type of fight scene (that's in fact in a street) around the end the movie, it's just...a banquet of madness.Plus, the soundtrack is -like in the previous movies- super satisfying.I am quite excited for what there is to come next in the MCU and for these characters we've seen in this movie...","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
2,8.0,24-Jul-24,"We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's ""X-Men"" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults, but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near ""fun filler"", it's not ""Infinity War"" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
3,1.0,24-Jul-24,"So many Easter Eggs, so true to the comic characters, and may have possibly single handedly saved the MCU. Everything you'd expect from a deadpool movie plus. Haven't left a theatre so buzzy in a very long time. Rips to shreds the tedium of the last 5 years of the MCU and makes you think there may be life after Endgame after all. Cinematic feel was great, amazing soundtrack and I'll probably go back again over the weekend to watch again. So lucky in NZ to get these preview nights w to 3 days before the rest of the world see them. God bless you Mr's Levy, Reynolds and Jackman, a laugh a minute ride!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
4,9.0,26-Jul-24,"I read an IGN review where the guy gave it a 7 because the story was poor.The guy really needs to read the room.You do not go to see Deadpool for a great, in-depth story which will make you think.You go to see Deadpool for fun, for obscene fight scenes, great jokes, bad jokes... Ridiculous deaths, sarcasms, obnoxious non PC comments and most importantly the most amazing music which brings it all together.And Deapool and Wolverine has that on every possible way.If you want to see this film, go to the cinema, don't wait for TV because you will miss one of the biggest and best watches to ever hit the big screen.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
5,9.0,24-Jul-24,"Went to an early midnight screening in a packed Imax. The whole theater was laughing and cheering throughout the movie. The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too. Hugh Jackman is amazing as Wolverine and the cameos are really something special, especially because they're usually more that just that.It's a fan service, but who cares - it's a entertaining fun summer blockbuster that gives you what you've paid for.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

7,9.0,24-Jul-24,"I saw this at an early fan screening and it was pure cinematic candy. I'm confident that it's the best movie of the summer!The whole audience was constantly either laughing, cheering or clapping. The jokes were hilarious and the cameos were amazing (and so many of them!). I won't spoil anything, but there were multiple cameos by characters you'll never see in any other movie, and I loved them. Fans of comic book movies will have a field day with all the references.It might be recency bias, but it's probably my favourite Deadpool movie (and I loved the first two). They definitely knew what the fans wanted (and what they didn't know they wanted) and gave it to them. Another hit from Shawn Levy.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

10,5.0,23-Sep-24,"I should have known this would be a disappointment. I was too excited by the prospect of Jackman returning and the relatively high rating. But I didn't like Deadpool 2 much and Deadpool & Wolverine continues with a similar tone and even worse weaknesses.This is clearly not a serious movie. I get that. But that comes with a trade-off. By being less serious, Deadpool 3 has more freedom to do whatever crazy, silly, ""offensive"", incongruous stuff the filmmakers want to. But that also sets the bar higher. If you can do anything, you better do some cool things. If you're gonna go crazy, you better go full crazy. But this movie really feels lazy, uninspired and as if it's pulling its punches.Reynolds and Jackman are likeable in the main roles, but they don't have much to do. They're both practically immortal and end up shooting and stabbing each-other hundreds of times. It gets old quickly. And it has no weight or implications. The actors were able to milk many of the lines, so I did laugh at times, but it leaves an empty feeling afterwards. Contrast that with Infinity War where the comedy has more weight because of the desperation of the situation. The comedy truly is relief, but in a comedy movie, jokes need to be bigger, better or more varied.A movie is only as good as its villain and Deadpool 3's villain is awful. Some bald lady doing a performance which would feel below average at a high school play. She has zero charisma or presence. Just this lame intense eye thing and waving her hands around. Her powers seem to be arbitrary and she doesn't consistently use them. Her motivation is also unclear and uninteresting. No idea why they got this actress.The cameos were mildly exciting at first but largely turn out to be gimmicky. Many characters are brought back only to do absolutely nothing at all. I'm reminded of Sheeva in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Sure, you get your cheap laugh, but then what? Several characters are killed unceremoniously with no real wit, shock or meaning. Compared to what could have been done, it's really lazy and disappointing. It feels like Family Guy flashbacks - cheap jokes and nothing more.Of all the worlds in the MCU, this movie seems to build on the world of the Loki TV show more than anything else. A show with no consistent rules and several mediocre actors. Again, of all the things you could do, given such freedom, this is super lame. It feels like they knew they needed time travel and/or multiverse shenanigans to make the plot work and so chose Loki for that reason. Again, it's just lazy - a choice made for convenience rather than passion or potential.There is a relatively serious subplot concerning Wolverine but it seems like things were cut out - we never seem to learn the key facts or context. I thought at least there might be some gravitas or insight with that part of the movie, but it led nowhere.Reynolds is pretty good at breaking the 4th wall, but that's not enough to save an otherwise weak movie. And just because you joke about X, doesn't mean you can get away with X, whatever X might be. For example, sloppy multiverse shenanigans. Oh, we're joking about it too, so that means it's okay. Not really.Channing Tatum was completely miscast in his role. His accent wasn't too bad, but he's way too bulky and just not a good actor overall and not for comedy. One cameo was pretty cool, including his grey streaks of hair, even though I haven't seen any of his movies. Others felt ironic, like look at this obscure character you'd probably forgotten about. Maybe it's a bit nostalgic, but there's a reason certain movies and characters were unpopular.Every step of the way, the movie goes for the obvious, easy, dumb joke, rather than anything risky or more deeply creative. For example, part of the movie clearly evokes Mad Max, which got me a bit excited. Are we gonna get some over-the-top Mad Max style action? What other movies will this pay homage to? But no. It does nothing with it. Here's a character with some history. But let's not delve into that or pay anything off, let's just kill them.Aside from anything else, the filmmaking itself is mediocre. The action is generic, the comedy is generic, several actors are below average, if that. There's too much slow motion which makes boring scenes even more so. Reynolds and Jackman deserve better.And the violence, while generally inoffensive, is nevertheless gratuitous and mean-spirited. At times, it seems the movie has nothing to offer BUT violence, and not very stylised violence at that. Just the same things again and again, done far more effectively in other movies, in terms of VFX, choreography, stakes, style, etc.It's also disappointing to see some characters from the first movie do nothing at all. What's the point? The first one was better and the sequels have gone the wrong way. Nolan's Batman trilogy is funnier while also vastly more original, masterful, challenging and dark. The best MCU movies have much better action, acting and humour. I could've easily skipped this one in hindsight...","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
11,8.0,24-Jul-24,"So that was a trip. I really enjoyed that film, and think both casual and hardcore fans will be pleased. Not perfect, but still pretty darn entertaining. There's a temptation lately for films that aren't perfect to be seen as a disappointment, and I hope that isn't the case here.The Deadpool and Wolverine team up has been teased since 2009's disaster X-Men Origins: Wolverine movie. The film aims to strike a balance between being accessible to casual viewers while also satisfying die-hard fans of the characters.However, the film also faces the challenge of navigating the complex and intricate web of continuity that exists within the Marvel universe. With close to 50 (!) films in its continuity (not including the TV shows and Sony's films), the Deadpool and Wolverine movie needed to carefully thread the needle to ensure that it honors the established lore while also delivering a fresh and engaging story.Despite the potential baggage of its expansive continuity, the Deadpool and Wolverine works as a standalone.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
12,8.0,24-Jul-24,"My first review.I'm not a huge Marvel fan, but I've watched all Deadpool and loved them.Don't know what it is about this one but I've found it hilarious, and it would seem that whole theatre did as well. All jokes are spot on, acting is awesome (with few exceptions), action is great - all in all a movie I would recommend to anyone who can stomach a bit of adult (and childish) humour and gore.Story is OK, nothing special, but execution makes up for it. Cameos are, as far as I'm concerned, awesome as well.And one more thing - pacing is also spot on - 2 hours flew by.I'll keep it short - just go and watch it!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
13,8.0,24-Jul-24,"Watched it on IMAX with my parents and it was definitely worth it. It was truly entertaining and fun. Smiling and laughing from the start till the end. Also, I never thought I would see some ""old"" characters and ""old/new"" characters in this film. Many easter eggs, if you're that nerd, truly nostalgic. I could say this is one of the best multiverse film ever. Also the soundtrack for this film was great. However, the movie should have been longer because we waited for many years for this prequel. When it ended, it was bittersweet because I grew up with these movies. Thank you Deadpool, our Marvel Jesus.....and Logan, the wrong guy always. :)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Don't get me wrong, Ryan Reynolds does a phenomenal job, and the some scenes are just way to hilarious. But it lacked something which i somehow can't explain, it just seemed like they could have come up with a better story imo. But what do I know?I say go for it, and at least you end up laughing.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

17,6.0,28-Jul-24,"This is the first Marvel movie in a long time that didn't make me want to fast-forward to the end. It runs on fan service, cameos and everything that came before. I liked it well enough, but I got the feeling throughout that Disney is throwing a bunch of stuff we've really wanted at us in a sloppy, disorganized way, in the hopes that we will forget about all the flops and start coming to their movies again. It's almost like someone told Ryan Reynolds to make something we'll like because the money is drying up and they need a hit. This movie isn't going to fix anything like a lot of people thought it would. Not as good as 1, but better than 2. I'll probably watch it again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
18,1.0,25-Jul-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" was everything that I ever wanted, and it BLEW MY MIND AWAY, with surprising CAMEOS, but not gonna tell ya! You have to watch it on the BIG SCREEN to believe it! It takes it to a WHOLE NEW LEVEL!!! It literally blow me away with every exciting elements and a whole new adventure, and I'm loosing my mind! I never felt more excited and so happy with joy as I am right now!!!Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, are way OVER THE TOP with their BEST performances! The one and only loud mouth superhero/non superhero comedy goof ball: DEADPOOL, and once again, returns as the X-Men strongest tough superhero: WOLVERINE! The PERFECT team up, straight out of the MCU comic book genre!Emma Corrin played the best supervillain role as Cassandra Nova, and she literally nailed that part so brilliantly, and Matthew Macfadyen did a pretty good job as Mr. Paradox, and I never knew how the TVA can go from a whole new direction in the film. The ACTION, the COMEDY, the SPECTACLE, the JOKES, the GORE, and every best Marvel moments was beautifully well done by the book when it comes to Kevin Feige, and along with the MCU team, that can actually make many Marvel movies possible, to keep Stan Lee's name and his legacy alive!Shawn Levy, who made Free Guy, Night at the Museum films, Real Steel, and The Adam Project, did a really great job making his version of Deadpool happen on the BIG SCREEN, and we finally got what the Marvel fans wanted! Everything with Marvel Studios was brilliant, I'm not gonna say anything about it tho, so NO SPOILERS, lmao, but this was definitely the best buddy superhero movie of 2024, and I would love to go see D&W, over and over and over and over again!LFG!10/10..... more like: 1000/10!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
19,6.0,23-Sep-24,"D&W is a film that objectively deserves a nice 4: full of holes in the plot, history to forget and probably one of the most lame of the whole MCU, characters without any emotional depth and many other cinematic horrors. Wolverine is reduced to a mere character that serves only to support the jokes of Deadpool. Which is a shame, since Jackman is a great actor who could have been used much more. The title of the most suitable film would be: Deadpool (written in giant letters) & a bit of Wolverine (as subtitle). The villain is terrible to say the least: almost non-existent motivations, a little random powers and a forced and fake acting. The secondary characters are strung with force , according to the fan service fashion to which the film continually winks. So why is my grade 6? It's simple: it's funny. It's a very flat and drawn-out movie, but it's funny, and not little. The irony of this film is unmatched and it makes fun of anything, following a comical pattern that has disappeared with the culture of politically correct (Disney...). The final film is free, unrestrained, unregulated and minimally influenced. Get ready to laugh every 10 minutes: the jokes are so sharp that it's almost impossible not to mention a small smile. It's a pity that comedy is not enough, if everything else is as mediocre as few films.Honorable mention for Dogpool, who, believe me, is the best actor in the film. And that says a lot.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
20,5.0,31-Jul-24,"When did cursing more become a recipe for humour?Much of the film is filled with Wolverine and Deadpool needlessly stabbing of one another as if that was going to help the plot.The cameos were more time fillers because the plot itself was without any substance.They should stop Ryan Reynolds from writing screenplays. Anyone encouraging him should be accused of having an agenda.If you feel that my review is stupid, ask yourself what's left of the film once you remove stupid insults, stabbing, shooting and witless sexual references?I get that the film is a fantasy action film. It just doesn't deliver on any other level other than being base comedy.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
21,8.0,24-Jul-24,"Remember back in 2022 when Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness came out? That was when everyone was so pumped up after No Way Home that they were expecting another bang from the MCU? Especially when 'Multiverse' was attached to it, everyone thought they would be tons of cameos, many WOW moments and the scope would be bigger before everyone was kinda disappointed because it was not what we expected it to be though... the film is still good. Just the hype that actually killed the film.Now, after watching Deadpool & Wolverine, it felt like Disney and MCU had learned from that because oh boy, everything you wanted in Dr Strange back in 2022, you will get it here in this third installment. This is a love letter to all the fans. It's a movie that's going to SAVE future MCU movies. From the moment the film began, we knew that everyone in it had so much fun making this. It's quirky, it's jaunty and it's all about giving back to the society.Did I hear cameos? Yeppy, the number of cameos here is the one you would be satisfied with. It's a lot for a 2-hour film. And what's great is that the cameos aren't just limited to the characters, but also to objects, physical references, locations and etc. A lot of the brainstorming and creative processes go to making sure they bring the best out of these cameos. And believe us when we say that they honour the cameos so much more they what they did for Multiverse of Madness. They took note and made sure they delivered the cameos the right way that it should be.Previous Deadpool showed a lot of gore. Now, add Wolverine into it and this is the goriest we've seen MCU pulled in their movie since Iron Man 1. It's satisfying. What we've been hoping from Disney not to tone down anything, they even made this one even better. Blood is this movie's middle name and we're in for a treat.Is the plot interesting enough? Well, it's a bit more complicated to answer this one. Definitely, this is a fun wild ride from beginning until the end, it's like walking down the memory lane. But we cannot overlook that this film does rely on those cameos and fan services to make an impact in its storytelling. Throw all the fan services out there, will it still be good? Might be but it will be another post-covid MCU film. But hey, one thing's for sure, it opens to A LOT of doors for future MCU films. The right doors. But hey, Deadpool & Wolverine has plenty to look out for. The stakes are higher, the villain is formidable and the titular characters' arcs are just golden.Deadpool being Deadpool, it's such a treat watching him having fun. It really feels like Deadpool is directing this movie. And writing it. And putting all the jokes in it. All the jokes are mostly on point. Some are verbally explicit, some really got us laughing out loud, some are even fresh from the oven, it's unheard of. The movie really knows what the fans want.But one thing to note of, you need to have a good pop culture knowledge for you to understand a lot of the jokes or references here. This may be a downside for some especially the general audience. It is a bit hard if you don't follow the current trends or news that's happening. You may be left a tad bit confused.While the fun is there, sometimes they might be having too much fun? To the extent that some scenes felt way too parodied. It took us out from the experience a bit. The CGI felt off at times, with the scenes and contexts became too ridiculous. It's like they had total freedom to do what they wanted without really thinking through where the story should go next. I mean, having total freedom is a rare but great thing in Hollywood but if it's too much, then it's too much.Adding to that, it did feel like it was a 'free roam' film. It's not properly thought out through. It's empty at times, relying on cameos and jokes to sustain audience's interest. It's sort of like a museum filled with artifacts and vintages and rarely seen treasures but there wasn't really a strong cohesive narrative to end it with a bang. It meanders without a clear direction for the bigger scope of the MCU. Not to say that the plot isn't interesting, it still is but just not on par with everything else we're getting in this film.You might think this is a nitpick but we felt there's one particular music that is in the track list that had so much potential but was enormously wasted. They could have done so much more with the song! Like, SO MUCH MORE. Why put it out there if you're gonna properly use it? Might as well just cut the song entirely. Such a wasted opportunity. Sigh.Verdict: Deadpool & Wolverine is like a fanboy's wildest dream come true! It's the ultimate love letter, packing in all the juicy stuff we wished for from Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness-think epic cameos, fan service galore, and gore that makes Iron Man look like a teetotaler. It's a zany, nostalgic joyride that flings open doors for future MCU madness. If you're itching to relive the epic feels of Infinity War, Endgame, and No Way Home, buckle up, buttercup-you're in for a rollercoaster of epicness. Chef's kiss muahhh-this one's a riot!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I went with my mom who does not know anything about marvel (only Spiderman) but had no problems following a few jokes here and there about moments from past films but nothing to worry about not being able to follow the movie.

25,6.0,26-Jul-24,"It was painful to watch this movie at times. While Deadpool is known for his crude, foul language, this movie went overkill.With all the jokes made in prior movies and trailers, this movie showed up with an almost empty tank of gas. The plot was simply dumb and didn't do much for the Deadpool franchise. Most of the humor was the same formula. After a while it felt like a funny comedian telling the same joke but in a different style over and over and over again. It got old.There were some fun scenes, but for the first time in a Deadpool movie, there were many parts where I simply lost interest and checked my watch.They probably should have taken the wins from the first two Deadpool movies and left it at that--and I would have been 100% ok with it.Not worth the movie ticket, but good enough when it goes digital.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Great performances by the cast but it doesn't make up for a shoddy story. This movie leans into breaking the 4th wall and the metaverse aspect which made the original unique but now it's the only substance of the movie and has been run into the ground.

28,1.0,31-Jul-24,"""Disney brought him back. They're gonna make him do this till he's 90."" Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) about Wolverine (Hugh jackman)The allure of super-hero movies is ultimately elusive to me when I try to reconstruct them the way I would a drama, comedy, or piece of art. First, like the current hit, Deadpool & Wolverine, some just don't fit the formula, for it is both a comedy and an actioner. Additionally, it has superior dialogue in the form of the 1930's screwball comedies with enough allusions to current pop culture and The Marvel Cinematic Universe to keep graduate students 100 years from now in perpetual research mode.Secondly, it has two of today's prominent actors in Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Reynolds is a master of co-writing terse, biting dialogue while he delivers it with the finesse of, say, Cary Grant in His Girl Friday. Jackman carries as he always did guilt for his past sins and feelings of inadequacy about being a hero.However, with his buddy Deadpool, he becomes a hero, not unlike the most famous buddies of all, Butch Cassady and the Sundance Kid. Scenes here become almost always set pieces each preparing us for the next but never definitive (regeneration being a possibility in many cases). Their vulnerability is weak while they exploit the unnatural resources of their bodies and spirits to stall inevitable death.For this ""Deadpool,"" getting to another time line to survive and possibly even change history would help both to reverse the guilt they feel for inadvertently causing deaths of those closest to them, both children and lovers. Although the dialogue deserves its R rating, the sentiment is boilerplate superhero stuff: find real love, find family, find yourself.Deadpool & Wolverine is exciting summer fare for young adults and older. It's beautifully photographed, and one of its themes centers on the bromance of the two leads and the general search for love and family. Although MCU is now owned by Disney, it is unsanitized with sparkling, smutty dialogue especially pleasing to word guys like me.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The story is very fleshed out, and put together, and really fits into the wider marvel universe. It's laugh out loud funny? And such a rip roaringly good time. The cameos are fantastic - and feel like real fan service. I've waited a long time for this, and it feels like exactly what I wanted. You can see how much this character and franchise means to Ryan Reynolds - and that makes his the safest hands. I hope to see a fourth entry, in the meantime, I will go rewatch this a few times.

The movie lacked with quite a lot of filler areas with too many attempts at punchlines, a lot worked, a lot didn't.The movie was quite long and could have been cut in a number of areas which was even referenced in the movie as it did feel like it was dragging in the over-extended middle act of the film. A lot of the dialogue in places were ruined by failed punchlines but that's the style that the film goes with.Overall it was fun but nothing out of the ordinary, will do well in the box office! 7/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
31,9.0,8-Sep-24,"Ok after delaying watching this movie at its opening back in July because i never believe all the hype, i finally relented and went to see the thing. Now the only thing going for this movie is the impressive effects you can see alot of money has gone into making this movie .My gripe about this film is the story line .Summed up in one word in my opinion to me the movies is just plain daft. The different time lines ? The different versions of the Wolverine character . Another Marvel movie that comes to mind regarding this topic was the last Spiderman movie when all the actors that potrayed the Spiderman character all appeared in it .To me it just got stupid. As for this latest Deadpool saga Ryan Reynolds quick comedic quips get to be tiresome after a while. At least i did'nt pay to see the thing my wife did.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I do not accept at all that this film be given less than the perfect mark. Indeed, it is a complete film and it is difficult for it in every sense of the word. Although there are some slight bumps, including the speed of people's movement being exhausting, but they are not very harmful, but only a little in some moments of the film. I will support this film and hope that it wins several awards, such as an Oscar or a Golden Globe. It's a great movie.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

What Deadpool has said and shown in the movie, I believe that it will be banned in many parts of the world, but those who know who Deadpool is will be thrilled to know that this is by far the best part of the story of the immortal anti-hero...

35,7.0,2-Aug-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film that is ready to send adults (and it is for adults) to their youth or even childhood. A picture that gives out an eerie stream of interesting things, without giving you a break even for a second. This is a real celebration of the history of superhero cinema, a tribute to all the best that we have seen on screen in recent decades. The film successfully combines the spirit of old tapes and the freshness of the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe, creating a unique spectacular adventure that sees off past eras with love and dignity.One of the film's strengths is acting. Ryan Reynolds, returning to the role of Deadpool, shows unsurpassed skill, balancing on the edge of sarcasm, black humor and sincerity. His Deadpool remains the same brash, witty and unpredictable, causing laughter and admiration from the audience. Hugh Jackman, who has tried on Wolverine's claws again, brings his unique charisma and depth to the film, showing a hero who has come a long way.The script of the film is full of humor and irony, with dizzying jokes that not only mock superhero cliches, but also subtly play with the expectations of the audience. Wild and brazen jokes just blow the roof off, demonstrating that ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is not afraid to be bold and unusual. This film makes you laugh at yourself and at the whole genre, while maintaining respect for its history and heritage.Special attention should be paid to the numerous cameos and small stories of other characters that fill the picture. These moments not only evoke nostalgia, but also add depth and richness to the plot. They serve as pleasant surprises for fans, skillfully weaving into the general outline of the narrative and enriching the world in which the characters live.""Deadpool and Wolverine"" successfully fits into the already well-known Marvel Cinematic Universe, without losing its uniqueness. The film combines elements of comedy, drama and action, creating a colorful and vivid spectacle. This film becomes a worthy ending for the story of some characters and at the same time a new beginning for others, allowing them to look into the future with optimism and expectation.The script skillfully touches on the themes of friendship, devotion and heroism. Even in its ironic and sarcastic style, the film does not forget about the human aspects and emotional moments, making the characters more alive and real.The film also stands out for its great action and thoughtful choreography of battle scenes. These episodes are needed, the fans have been waiting for them, I'm sure they won't be disappointed. I was thrilled. The production combines the intensity and entertainment inherent in the best representatives of the genre, and the unique style inherent in Deadpool and Wolverine. The use of special effects and makeup at the highest level, especially impressive are the scenes using the abilities of the characters and their incredible regeneration.It is worth noting the participation of a talented team of creators, including director Sean Levy, who has already proved himself in projects with a vivid visual style and the ability to work with actors. Under his guidance, the film maintains a balance between humor and drama, without slipping into excessive seriousness, but also without turning into a pure parody.The film is also notable for its high production quality: The costumes of the heroes, from the classic Deadpool costume to the updated Wolverine image, are made with great attention to detail. The creators seem to have satisfied the desires of everyone, without exception, by showing on the screen everything that is needed and what the fans were waiting for. The soundtrack includes both original tracks and familiar compositions that create a special atmosphere and enhance the emotional impact.The creators did not forget about comic book fans either: the film has a lot of references and ""Easter eggs"" that will delight connoisseurs and fans of the franchise. These elements make viewing even more fun and layered, giving fans the opportunity to discuss and discover new details even after several views.We had to wait a long time for a new and, more importantly, a high-quality project in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is becoming, as I see it, an important milestone in the history of the Multiverse, around which the global story has been spinning for the last few years. It's not just a movie, it's an event that marks the end of one era and the beginning of another. He combines all the best things that we loved in superhero movies, and does it with respect and admiration. This is a colorful, bright and timely film that will delight both long-time fans and new viewers.9 out of 10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I thought the action was fine, mostly too bloody and I think therefore it's a little dull when it does come to the action. But other then that this feel had plenty of laughs, Hugh is one of the best casting choices of all time, and Ryan has a Stella performance as Deadpool once again. The Chemistry is on point, they both have some laughs, it's the same type of humour you'd expect, and I understand it might not be for everyone, I completely understand. Deadpools first Installment had many laughs too, But yes the humour can be a thing of the past, I did have some laughs though however.

38,1.0,24-Jul-24,"I just saw the movie together with my family and we don't agree; one thought it was epic, one said really good and I thought it was meh.Don't get me wrong, Reynolds and Jackman are awsome together and many of the smaller roles are great, but the biggest problem lies in the absence of a good story. Deadpool 1 and 2 told exciting adventures packed with humor and entertaining violence. This third installation is packed with that same kind of humor and overly filled with gore, but has a really weak plot. At times it felt like I was watching a bunch of separate skits poorly tied together. And let's hope this is the last multiverse story (which it isn't); variants were fun at first but it's getting really old.To summarize; this movie has awsome moments that will make MARVEL-fans, both MCU and comic readers, smile widely but as a whole it's not great.Hope you'll enjoy it!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Obviously, Wolverine is enough of a hint, but too many people go to the movie just for deadpool/ryan reynolds himself. I think this could have been milder and more funny and undestandable to the average viewer.If you were fully immersed because of your superheroe knowledge, this movie should absolutely be an 8+ because this is exactly what marvel-fans wanted to see. It brings all characters together in a hilarious, yet emotional and exciting way. I'm not the biggest superheroe geek, but I can totally imagine most fans were absolutely delighted and hyped up with all the surprising easter eggs.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Too many cameos that felt like they were there Just Because. I (and I'm sure many others) would have happily sat through another half an hour if it meant getting something of substance from the cameos we got rather than have them pop up so we can all do that one Leo DiCaprio meme. You know the one I mean.Oh, I also think one of the cameos was completely miscast. Like, they used THAT guy? WHY???For the main cast, though, the highlight for me was absolutely Emma Corrin. I mean, we all know that Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are perfectly suited for their roles, and we know that most of the cameo actors are suited to their roles, but Emma Corrin. My word. She was incredible as Cassandra Nova! I do wish, though, that she'd been given more to work with. You know, make her a REAL threat?Anyway, this was easily the weakest of the Deadpool movies so far, to me, and that's a real shame because they had the opportunity to do something REALLY special here...","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

For the record, when to 'break the forth wall' is expected all the fun behind it starts to vanish. But, in recent times, people (the entertainment industry) needed something to make the movie theaters running and this movie helps in this intent. There's nothing in it that subverts the genre, by the way. Again, there are very enjoyable parts that are quite funny but they can't sustain the pace of all the shallowness of the script. The violent scenes are quite impressive, well directed, for sure, but the story is weak.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

50,4.0,26-Jul-24,"Despite pretty much every single superhero movie that came out recenty turning out to be a letdown, I had realy high expectations for this movie just like a lot of other people. Though the bar wasn't high. In fact, it was at an all time low for me due to my first point, all the recent superhero movies being subpar and therefore lowering my standards.So I went in with high hopes on the day of the premiere, and while I enjoyed the movie while watching it, when I left the theatre, I found myself to be questining the movie. Yes, I had laughed a lot while watching it and it was a lot of fun but it really was just mindless fun? The sort of movie that you should turn off your brain in order to enjoy. It just wasn't what I was expecting.Movie spends a lot of time trying to explain the time travel and the multiverse stuff for the uninformed audience while also acknowledging that it is stupid through some wall breaking jokes. Why even bother? When the movie isn't wasting time explaining multiverse shenanigans, people are fighting almost constantly. Yes, the choreography looks cool but when you think about it, there really is nothing at stake when they're fighting.So the movie is just a mixture of cool fighting scenes and boring explanations. A weird combination really and in the great scheme of things, things that happen throughout this movie doesn't seem to be having a big impact on the cinematic universe. Which is a shame considering how they were setting up Deadpool as some sort of ""Marvel Jesus"" with their trailers. Under the light of the MCU, this movie feels like Spider-Man: No Way Home but worse. LOGAN came out in 2017, I can't speak for others but for me it was too soon bringing Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine. I didn't feel any nostalgia or anything and I believe nostalgia is why people are praising this movie so much.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
51,1.0,28-Jul-24,"My dad fell asleep during this. Twice. If he'd been awake, we could have left.This movie is shockingly boring. We couldn't figure out why until discussing it in the car. And then, lightbulb, we realized: there is no point to watching two perfectly matched, immortal beings fight.There are no stakes. We all know no one is going to die or suffer any consequences for longer than five seconds. So every fight scene was basically the equivalent of watching two toddlers squabble. But with even the threat of a time out removed. It got tiresome immediately, yet continued the entire film. The thing could have been about thirty minutes long if they pulled the gratuitous, but pointless, fight scenes out.The multiverse stuff has further removed the stakes, since if anything bad happens, they can just rewrite it and start over in a new film.This movie is yet another fan-service circle jerk. The entire film is set up to feed the audience a string of obscure, niche character and forgotten fandom cameos, with the weakest of plots holding it together like used chewing gum to justify it. They pulled from Marvel, they pulled from XMen, then it got weird and they started pulling from other fandoms, like Mad Max and Blade. I'm honestly shocked Star Wars didn't end up in there, somewhere, but maybe that would have blown the budget and the nerd audience's heads.Having grown up casually watching the XMen cartoon after school everyday in the 90's, I admittedly recognized about 80% of the cameod characters, and had a brief flare of ""oh, it's that one guy! Uh.."" Before again wondering what the point was, because there was little point to them being there other than to be fan-service.My dad had NOT grown up with that particular after school cartoon and said he was completely lost and didn't know who anyone was or why they kept introducing more and more of them.This one feels for-fans-only. If you are the sort to freak out that Wolverine is in a comic-accurate costume and feel sustaining delight at a five second glimpse of some random character who was in a couple episodes thirty years ago in a crowd fight scene, this movie is for you. If you are the sort to realize there are reasons why they haven't used the comic costume, like how it makes Wolverine look like he's got roided-out collar bones in a really, really weird way, and have been a casual viewer of all things Marvel-owned, you won't get the references and will bored, missing what's nine tenths of the film's purpose, so skip it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

55,6.0,24-Jul-24,"Just got home after watching in the theater and I just gotta say, what a great movie. Before going into it I was a little worried that we would get a watered down disneyfied Deadpool, but aside from making a bunch of jokes about it, you couldn't feel any difference. It was the same Deadpool we saw in the first two movies and the same Deadpool we, or at least I, wanted.The humor was, in my opinion, mostly dead on. Of course not all the jokes land the same with everyone and there was a few where I felt it was obvious that I was missing whatever it was referencing, but that didn't really take away from it. Not every joke has to land, just enough and to me enough of them did.I was a bit worried that I would be missing some of the context of the movie since I've pretty much stopped following Marvel since they, in my opinion, have gone sharply downhill since Endgame, but they handled it very well. I'm sure people that are up to date with Marvel will notice some easter eggs and references I didn't, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything plot relevant.Where I think some people will probably criticize the movie is the story. It is not an intricate masterpiece of story telling, but if you go into a Deadpool movie expecting that then you're setting yourself up to be disappointed.Now I'm not going to go too much into the cameos because I don't want to spoil, even though I am sure the internet is already full of spoilers, but they were there and they were great. Having managed to avoid spoilers there were also several cameos that I did not see coming that were absolutely amazing.Last thing I want to mention is the music. It was just on point in a way that...well I don't really know how to explain it, in a way that is just Deadpool through and through.So overall a great movie, most definitely recommend watching it and I'll likely go back for seconds in a couple of days.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This is the weakest of the three movies.As usual, this movie is about one or two stars overrated as it seems most Disney movies are awarded one or two extra stars by default. Comparing it to the previous two, this one is like orange Koolaid compared to real orange Juice.The soundtrack was also poorly placed and they seemed to use it as a tool to improve weakly written scenes.That being said it wasn't un-enjoyable. They certainly gave the audience what they were missing from previous films with Wolverine and the cameos from previous Marvel movies were fun to see. Sadly this movie was lacking the humour of previous Deadpool films. I could count the times I laughed on one hand.I gave this movie 6 stars because of the cameos and fanservice.

Fans in their 40s or older will often feel like they've traveled back in time. The costumes are incredibly beautiful. My advice to those who watch the movie in Turkey is to watch it dubbed without subtitles and see what kind of a performance Harun Can gives. Ryan reynolds definitely elevated his Deadpool performance with Hugh jackman next to him. Incredible harmony, incredible jokes. Watch the movie, watch the movie.

They could've given her character a bit more screentime and we had sr many flashbacks in the film, I was hoping for one wet her character. The villain was under utilised, given her potential, as it was the case in Thor: Love and Thunder.The opening sequence was terrific and one of the best of all times. So many easter eggs and the appearance of new characters, which has opened up for exciting times ahead. I expected a bit more from a movie which served as a farewell to these fan favourite fox studio's characters. With MCU rebooting the entire X-Men franchise, it'll be interesting to see how things unfold.Post credit scene doesn't add much to the future of the MCU and is just a continuation of the film(and a banter).End credit scene is a wholesome tribute to the Fox Studio and its film franchises.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

65,7.0,31-Jul-24,"This had everything that I wanted and more. It is likely to bring the MCU back to profitability, not that it ever truly struggled that much artistically. Disney did not tone this down, it is just as violent, raunchy and otherwise delightfully offensive as the first two. There is definitely a lot of fanservice but all of it works in context and it doesn't feel like pandering. Unlike the Fox X-Men movies, no character just gets lost in the background, everyone gets strong moments. The titular duo are incredible together. This delivers a lot of what we want from the comics and the movie series that it combines.The comedy targets absolutely everyone and is constantly laugh out loud funny; everything is fair game. There's a good mix of different types of jokes, so it never risks getting stale. You never know exactly what you're going to get next. The film definitely does have some issues due to being basically several things at once, similar to Dr Strange 2 and No Way Home. Sequels to highly successful entries, trying to do specific new story lines, follow up on stuff that wasn't even hinted at in its predecessor, and deliver multiversal shenanigans. This fares better by combining these things and tying it all directly into the plot in a very natural way. The villain is quite fun. Everyone feels like they're just jazzed to be on the show, man. 10/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

But ask myself did I find myself saying I NEED to see it again... no.I get the point of it and the very on the nose of how sh#te marvel has been recently. And fully enjoyed big names being involved in the humour and taking part. But it just didn't feel like a complete movie or story to me. Ironically (or not) just the same as the recent stuff that's not went down too well?Don't bash me, I still found it a fun watch but nowhere near as good as previous deadpool.. felt like a way to make fun of itself but also... not doing that as well as previous either.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

68,1.0,26-Jul-24,"The title of this might be misleading, but I did enjoy the film. It knows it's an action-packed superhero movie that you can turn your brain off to. There are lines of dialogue that literally allude to this when they exposition-dump on us or set up a fight sequence and it's this kind of meta humor that really makes it work.There are plenty of funny moments, especially one involving a certain member of the X-Men. The buddy cop dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine works well. It's got a ton of easter eggs for all the geeks who keep up with the lore, but unlike so many other recent Marvel projects, it doesn't feel like that's the only thing you have to look forward to while you watch it.I only have two complaints: the fight scenes and the villains. I felt that the earlier Deadpool installments handled the action better. There were moments that made you scared for certain characters in the other movies, but that element was essentially missing from this one. After the first few they start to feel repetitive. There's one fight scene that somewhat compensates towards the film's conclusion, but overall I would've liked some more intensity from some of the others.The villains felt lackluster. I won't say much because I don't want to spoil anything, but I would've preferred different ones. The ones we got weren't much of a spectacle and the salt in the wound is that the writers behind this are clearly capable of doing so.It's 7/10 for me, go see it if you like Marvel and superheroes, but I don't think it's one of those superhero stories that can bring in folks outside of that demographic like Invincible.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

70,3.0,24-Jul-24,"The cinematic experience that brings together two of Marvel's most beloved antiheroes in a whirlwind of action, humor, and heart. The film's greatest strength lies in the chemistry between Deadpool and Wolverine. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprise their roles with such ease and familiarity that it feels like a reunion of old friends. Their banter is sharp, witty, and perfectly timed, providing a constant stream of laughter amidst the chaos. The action sequences are a visual spectacle, with choreography that showcases each character's unique fighting style. Deadpool's acrobatic gunplay and Wolverine's ferocious close combat are highlighted in scenes that are both intense and exhilarating. The narrative is well-paced, allowing for character development without sacrificing the momentum of the plot. The story weaves in elements from both characters' pasts, giving fans a deeper understanding of their motivations and vulnerabilities. Visually, the film is stunning. The special effects are top-notch, with seamless CGI that brings the characters' abilities to life in a believable way. The use of color and lighting adds depth to the scenes, particularly in the depiction of Deadpool's regenerative powers and Wolverine's adamantium claws. Surprisingly, the film also offers a significant emotional depth. The exploration of themes such as redemption, friendship, and the cost of immortality adds layers to the narrative, making it more than just a typical superhero movie. In conclusion, this delivers on all fronts. It's a film that will satisfy fans of both characters, as well as attract new audiences with its humor & action.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It's about celebrities, fanservice, and the movie industry. It's more about Jackman and Reynolds than the characters they play. In fact, I'd say that their performances are merely the longest-running cameos in a movie glutted with cameos.There are so many fourth-wall breaks and snide asides that I never felt immersed in a story. I felt like I was sitting in a movie theater watching a movie about other, better movies. The only reason the fourth-wall breaks worked in the first movies is that they were rare and surprising. This entire movie is a fourth-wall break and that shtick gets old fast.The plot is uninteresting, as are the action sequences.

Deadpool & Wolverine... even though it's Rated R, is one of Marvel Studios' best movies ever made, it deserves a proper rating and it must break Box Office records, because both Reynolds and Jackman returned as Deadpool and Wolverine and the two of them nailed it. Great storyline and the comedy doesn't fail on this one like it failed on other MCU movies like Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.

The problem arises with the plot and the story.I honestly didn't believed that Deadpool is a good character for a multiverse story, but I told myself: okay it's Ryan Reynolds, it's Shawn Levy and it's Kevin Feige, so they'll together make it work. As it turned out they didn't.The movie sometimes feels like a bunch of comedy sketches played together, without a good reason. (The jokes are great, the problem is there's nothing else.) The villains have no backstory or motivation and that HUGE (like, really) plot armour for main heroes is what made me to give this movie a 6/10.It's sad, it's cruel, but I honestly can't give it a higher rating.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I really loved Emma Corrin's performance even their character is quite underdeveloped. I do love how they also utilized the cameos and guest performance of old Fox characters.Although there are some inconsistency and plot holes about how timelines and universes works, the plot of the movie is quite convoluted, it was saved by the acting performances, funny jokes and callbacks, absolutely insane fight choreography, stunning visual effects, and awesome easter eggs.Overall, it was a great send off for the Fox universe, third entry for the Deadpool movies, and a nice addition to Wolverine's movie catalog.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
77,1.0,8-Aug-24,"I enjoyed the first two Deadpool movies a lot, with the first being my favorite. I found DP3 less successful, mainly due to the weaker story. In the first two films, I felt they had a nice balance of humor, action, and story. Both of those movies had serious themes that drove Deadpool through the film. But this third one? The stakes just didn't seem that high. I wasn't the least bit invested in seeing DP and Wolverine succeed. That tension and hope were missing from this third film.I think I wasn't as engaged due to the endless breaking of the fourth wall. This was done in the first two movies, but not to the extent it happens here. It seems like every 5 minutes, someone turns and looks into the camera to make a joke. Many of the jokes are about Fox, Marvel, and Disney. A few are fine, but there are so many that you get yanked out of the story.The trash-talking was also dialed up to an eleven. It's almost like the writers felt they had to do a lot more wall-breaking and tasteless swearing to go beyond the past two films.There are a lot of positives, however. The character cameos are fantastic. I constantly found myself saying ""wow"" everytime someone new came on screen. Kudos to Reynolds and everyone for getting so many great characters from the past to be included in this movie.I also found the fight scenes and VFX to be excellent. The movie has a lot of great action. Although there were too many jokes, I have to admit I had many LOL moments.If you loved the first two DP movies, you will most likely enjoy this latest installment. For me, the fourth-wall breaks and crass humor diminished what could have been a stronger core story.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The cameos are surprising and helluva funny but most importantly the plot is refreshing. I'm very impressed by the balance between the funny vibe and the more serious emotional scenes, Hugh Jackman shows incredible acting in this movie.The only thing that could've been done better was Dafne Keen who felt a bit underused and some of her traits (like yelling in Spanish) wasn't shown enough.

82,1.0,24-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine' (or Deadpool 3) comes almost 8.5 years after 'Deadpool', over 7 years after 'Logan' and 24 years after 'X-Men'. A lot has happened in the MCU in that time - not as much in the Fox-verse - but it's almost instantly comfortable and fun being back in Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Reynolds)'s world. The film does a great job of both making fun of both the MCU and Fox films, whilst remaining true to the Deadpool and Wolverine/Logan (Jackman) characters and simultaneously integrating them into the MCU via the Time Variance Authority (if you haven't watched both seasons of 'Loki', highly recommended and will help with some of the multiverse aspects).That said, this still works well as a standalone unwilling-buddy-journey film, with Logan being a curmudgeon with no hope and Wade being a defeated optimist trying to save his friends. Wade, obviously, does most of the talking, with Reynolds banter as fast and dirty as ever, but Jackman holds his own. Cassandra Nova (Corrin) and Paradox (Macfadyen) are good as the not-always-sure-they're-100%-villains. The fight scenes, especially between the 2 of them, are fast and fun. But this is still an MA-rated film - there's lots of blood throughout! The score and soundtrack are great, with some very famous songs used in unique and funny ways throughout.There's so many nods/references to comics and past films from both studios that I won't mention any here. Except that Peter (Delaney) is back and has a few great moments. Needless to say, as a fan that's been following these characters since I was a teenager, there's not much more I could ask for from this film. It's maybe not as good as 'Logan', or the original 'Deadpool', but it certainly delivers a fun and emotional journey for both characters, with enough jokes to not get too serious, enough action to make it a blockbuster and enough heart to not let it descend into caricature.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Plus don't blink or you'll miss shots of wreckage in ""The Void"" that refers to Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2018.One of the fight scenes takes place in a beat up Honda Odyssey named ""Jenny"".The multiverse concept that Marvel have traded in so heavily in recent years is finally given the horse whipping it deserves in one scene involving more ""Deadpools"" than necessary.If you love a buddy comedy like ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", ""48 Hours"" or even ""Midnight Run"" then strap yourself in for just over 2 hours of riotous, near perfect entertainment where Paul Rudd finally ages.The 34th film in the MCU does not disappoint, even if it's the only Marvel movie we will see in 2024.If you love big slow-motion action sequences where you don't know who lives or dies then you're gonna love this flick.However, if you don't like the f-bomb & fourth wall breaks this might not be your cup of tea.Please promise me you won't leave the cinema till the house lights go on because everyone deserves a happy ending.I promise you your little cinematic universe is about to change, forever!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
85,9.0,26-Jul-24,"Big mixed feelings on this one. I feel it's tonally imbalanced in ways I don't remember the other Deadpool movies being. I had a similar feeling with Guardians of the Galaxy 3, though, and not many other people seemed to, so maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm getting on in years and find the hyperactivity - going from funny, to somber, to purportedly exciting - tiring. Maybe Deadpool was just funnier back when I was barely older than a teenager.I do think Deadpool & Wolverine has entertaining scenes, to stay a little positive. It's the way they're strung together (or barely strung together) that makes me feel a bit underwhelmed. The story it somehow both very straightforward and very convoluted, and I think something went wrong in the writer's room for this one. Maybe it's the improv (some of it funny, I'll admit) that throws the rhythm off to the point where there is no rhythm. Multiverse fatigue also plays a part, I think.But I like some ideas here. I like most of the action except for one really poorly-executed one that was just incomprehensible (the second to last big sequence, or, I could say, the biggest fight that isn't backed with a pop song).I don't feel they entirely justified bringing Wolverine back after Logan. Pointing it out doesn't make it okay, but the literalness of the opening scene was funny. Jackman is actually very good for what he's given. The couple of times he has a serious scene here, he really delivers. He's the best part of this film- the character's reintroduction feels rushed, but Jackman delivers when he's finally given some room to breathe.There were decent laughs, and not as many jokes missing as I feared. Action was mostly solid and bloody. Reynolds and Jackman have a good dynamic. Some references and callbacks were nice, some were eye-rolling.Unfortunately, you do feel the Disney overseers though. I wondered whether there wouldn't be any genuine raunch or sex scenes beyond references, and I was right. They keep making jokes about how Disney won't allow cocaine use, but it's a distraction, because what they actually won't allow sex or nudity. This thing is actually less risqué than the Austin Powers and Naked Gun movies, which might be the biggest disappointment here, considering they have milder ratings. I don't think the prudishness is in keeping with the Deadpool spirit.If you think you'll like this, you'll probably like it a little less than you hope you will, but might come away thinking it was still alright. If you don't think you'll like this, stay away; it won't convert you. I know it's a theatrical release, but it does feel a bit like it was made to be streaming service background noise, for what that's worth.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It has all the classic Deadpool elements, surprises, and Marvel Easter eggs. The action is epic and gory, especially for a Disney-Marvel movie. The movie is heavy on comedy, and the laughs keep coming until the end. The story picks up where the previous movie left off. The story does a fantastic job tying loose ends from all the other 21st-century Fox movies. It does a bit of foreshadowing for what may be in store for the MCU.

Characters have little to no motivation and just do stuff for, well... doing stuff. The arcs are not fleshed out, and the exposition is being spoon-fed to the point of regurgitation. The script repeatedly favors cheap thrills rather than telling a coherent story. The funny thing is the film is self-aware about all this to an extreme point where it starts butchering its own narrative.With that being said, the film still manages to redeem itself to some extent as everything else is S-tier. It has some of the craziest and goriest action sequences and stunt choreography in the MCU. Pretty much all of the jokes landed. The VFX department outdid themselves. The cameos are absolutely insane; two of them produced the loudest ear-raping war cries I have ever heard in a theater.Ryan and Hugh are so good in their roles that even with the lackluster script, it is virtually impossible not to have the time of your life watching this.

You also got to see other characters make a cameo/comeback that I was not at all prepared for. It was just great and goosebumped me up! The characters are also exactly as they should be and played perfectly by the actors. The bad guy is good, not the best bad guy, but good and contribute to the movie and comedy of it by making fools of our two leads.The jokes and satire are so hilariously funny in this one as well and they took the humor a step further and didn't hold back.

Moments with cameos were like ""whaaaat?"" ""Waaaaa"" ""ohhh"". You'll find out.Definitely recommend.Fun service was also very well awaited.So, I say: this is a blast and Marvel finally released something good.

That's about the only nice thing I can say about this film.The MCU is gigantic with many areas and characters to explore, so I simply don't understand why the writers made no effort in writing a story. People are fighting, characters appear out of nowhere with no intent, Wolverine takes his shirt off for no reason and the main villain has absolutely no motive. Such a missed opportunity to actually tell some kind of interesting story.The sad thing is movie is going do great and it will encourage Hollywood to create more fluff like this.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I'll give it a pass for going to joke where most Marvels don't (even if too far, but that's the point) and mostly avoiding woke or political nonsense, see Disney it makes a difference!Ryan Reynolds is on top of his game, with a lot of funny lines, although I and the cinema I was in more chuckled than erupted with laughter. The one liners aren't always a hit though. Too many already dated pop culture references and Easter egg jokes that I appreciated but not many got.Great to see Hugh Jackman back and great to see Wolverine in his proper costume (it looks better in animated, proof the filmakers got it right with the original X-Men).Will Deadpool revive the Marvel universe? I doubt it. Deadpool has always been its own thing, it's own weird world so no, and after the hype wears off people will settle to where it really lands.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
106,6.0,26-Jul-24,"Let's just start off the plot isn't perfect but this is a fun movie. Now if you come into this movie saying alright I'm going to grade this as if it was an essay like many critics do, taking away the whole movie going experience, then you won't enjoy this movie. However, if you come into this movie with an open mind and just try to sit down and enjoy a movie you'll find yourself laughing all the way through. Without saying spoilers there is a lot of fan service but that doesn't make the movie bad if anything it adds to the plot and is some of its shining moments. I will say this movie is less about developing the characters and more about showcasing them. My advice just go in with an open mind you don't need to be a marvel lover to enjoy this film it's funny, and has great action. There are definitely a few plot wholes and some not ideal choices with the story and that's why it's not a 10 however the action and comedy were amazing and the plot isn't bad it's just very simple. It is definitely the best Deadpool movie and one of the best Marvel movies (ignoring the plot wholes). I gave this a 9/10 on my enjoyment scale on a critic scale it's a 7.5/10 just because there were problems with the plot however as a whole the rest of the movie was great. What matters is how the movie makes you feel and the goal of this movie is for you to have a laugh and be entertained and it did a great job at that!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

108,6.0,25-Jul-24,"Wow, where to start. For this review I will not spoil because the cameos/characters were super well kept even from a fan like me who seeks out rumors and scoops. Compared to ENDGAME, SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME and others, speculation and rumors were a bit more obvious. For the most part Marvel Studios did a very good job hiding a good chunk.Let me start off by saying, most of us don't count the X-MEN ORIGNS: WOLVERINE film, and because of that I always kinda had a feeling that one day Ryan would convince Hugh, and that Hugh would eventually have a change of heart and return for this, because a proper Deadpool & Wolverine film without these two would have been an absolute missed opportunity. On a side note, it's precisely the reason I never bought a Hot Toy of Deadpool and Wolverine on the chance that this would happen. If you know what Hot Toys 1/6 scale figures are, kudos to you.So here we are and I can tell you right now that it's the movie that many thought DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS was expected to be. Some cameos that weren't revealed in the marketing, but were speculated was kind of obvious due to Ryan being particularly close with some of his actor friends, but there are cameos and characters that have actual meaningful roles. You would never have guessed that these particular characters Deadpool and Wolverine interact with would be in a movie like this and be played by that said actor. If you're a giant comic-book/super hero genre fan, you will be surprised.DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is equally the story of two characters, and also a story of two movies. One of which that celebrates the best of Fox's Marvel and uses the Fox Legacy characters extremely well, in a way that goes beyond empty cameos. The other is a mundane story that at times struggles to bring it all together, but good enough to get by the film as it is carried by the performances from Ryan and Hugh.At this point Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman can do this in their sleep. Born to play these roles and eventually they will one day hang it up for good (second retirement for Hugh as he's pulling an MJ), so we just need to appreciate what we have now. We're also now at an age where the talented visual development artists and costume designers can embrace the colorful and out there nature of superhero suits, so to finally see Hugh in the yellow and blue just hits the feels.Emma Corrin plays the film's antagonist Cassandra Nova and they are very good. They chew up the scenery, but like traditional MCU fashion it is a villain that is underdeveloped. Not the worst like many others, but they got the short end of the stick. Matthew Macfadyen plays Mr. Paradox, a TVA agent that has ambitions of his own. I haven't watched SUCCESSION, but I'm told it's similar to his character in the show. Leslie Uggams and Rob Delany also get a shoutout as Blind Al and Peter.As one should expect, tons of profanity and action that are all great fun and super violent. Deadpool has a lot of fun at the expense of the current state with the MCU. With the exception of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, the MCU has been bloated and unfocused post ENDGAME and Deadpool's fourth wall breaking holds nothing back about it, some Kevin Feige and meta jokes hit too. If you ever read my reviews I feel there is a time and place for humor, and certainly for a character like Deadpool a lot of the comedy works.Director Shawn Levy deserves some praise for this juggling act, as do the writers Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells. Also kudos to something you won't see on screen, but I felt that the film has that balance between being accessible to the general movie going audience, while also satisfying the well versed die-hard fans of the source material and films.DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is an extremely fun ride. I think it's easily the best of the three DEADPOOL films. That doesn't mean that the MCU is entirely cured from its current state, but this definitely puts it back slightly on track. Despite some of the same problems most of the MCU movies face, the backbone of the this film is carried through Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and how the film uses the other characters in meaningful fashion. I'll be curious to see how it will be received down the line when the novelty wears off, but for now it did duplicate the level of hype and feelings similar of SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME and I would place this in the higher tier of the bunch within the MCU and Fox.9/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
109,3.0,28-Jul-24,"First off, Disney Marvel's hands are all over this one. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It's more subtle, but it's all there.Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and a number of cameo appearances save the day, and probably the movie. I have a feeling they had to fight tooth and nail to make this movie as good as it is.That said, a lot of the humor seems forced, So does a lot of the profanity, of which there is a lot. To the point where I started to find it distracting.But mainly, the movie is slow in spots--especially the opening, the plot is disjointed, the antagonists aren't menacing in the least, and it's too long.I'm not saying that I'm sorry I watched it, or that you shouldn't watch it for the bright spots. But I think many people who aren't super Marvel fans will go ""That's nice"" and promptly forget about it.In short, it's only ""good"" in comparison the garbage the Disney Marvel has churned out over the last few years.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
110,1.0,29-Jul-24,"As someone not unfamiliar with the ""modern era"" of superhero films and now with a good 10 years of superhero fatigue, I found Deadpool 1 and 2 very refreshing - a superhero film that turns the genre on its ear and doesn't take itself too seriously, but has some genuine heart underneath. Additionally, you didn't need to have seen 5+ other films to ""get"" Deadpool as long as you were familiar with the broad characterizations and themes it was poking fun at.I hope you weren't expecting another Deadpool movie. This is a Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie that just happens to feature Deadpool. And if you're wondering why that particular distinction is important, well, based on that alone I can honestly say you're probably gonna have a bad time. (And if you just learned what ""MCU"" stands for cause I spelled it out above, abandon all hope. This film is not for you in the least bit.) Other than Ryan Reynolds, the rest of the usual supporting cast of Deadpool 1 and 2 are shown only briefly at the start and then quickly discarded for an endless parade of cameos by other heroes and villains from other Marvel movies. Each appears on-screen to be joke fodder for Reynolds, only to disappear moments later inconsequentially. This is the exact opposite of what Deadpool 1 and 2 achieved - which was an interesting main character, supporting cast and a strong amount of standalone charm.To have any chance of being in on the joke in DEADPOOL AND WOLVERINE, you need to be a veteran of the MCU. You also need to be a veteran of super hero movies going back possibly as far as the '90s since there are jokes about OLD failed franchise attempts like Elektra, and others which fizzled out, like Blade. You need to be a veteran of the Wolverine character and his various appearances throughout the years. You need to have followed a lot of the behind-the-scenes corporate acquisitions and drama of the franchises.This is truly a movie that demands you know the ""meta"" in way-too-deep detail. I've probably watched half of the above-mentioned MCU and superhero films, and grew up with the comic books (the Infinity gauntlet storyline came out when I was in high school), but I was still mostly lost and missing many of the inside-baseball jokes and twists. The ones I did fully grasp just weren't very funny or worth the payoff. Throw in the requisite ""clever"" riffs on Millennial and Gen-Z wokeness, where the film essentially disclaims or apologizes for a crude joke in advance before going on to make it anyway, and this film fell utterly flat for me. ""I know we're not supposed to use the c-word anymore, but you're kind of a c-word."" Imagine that said in Ryan Reynold's deliberately smarmy voice and you get the idea. Anyway, funny ha ha, right?The plot is some kind of alternate timeline/alternate universe nonsense to explain bringing back dead characters. Or something like that. The film isn't even clear on whether it's embracing or parodying this overused retcon mechanism but it resulted in an immediate audience tune out, yours truly included, and I stopped trying to figure it out as I mentally recounted how much money I just wasted. It was simultaneously too thin and thrown together, but also head-scratchingly too convoluted - because of course it has to jump through MCU hoops and rules to ""make sense"". And I am NOT kidding. If you so dare, search for ""TVA Marvel"" and prepare to go down a mega-nerd rabbit hole. I read comics as an 80s kid when the TVA was created and even I thought it was a bunch of hokey BS at age 11. But if something called ""the sacred timeline"" makes your nerd-o-meter beep madly and whip into a frenzy, you're going to love it, trust me. Anyway, it doesn't really matter because the ramshackle plot just serves to hang the zillions of cameos.Some are saying this film is filled with easter eggs but I would disagree. Easter eggs are extra little things that fans will notice but aren't necessary to enjoy the main story. Here, they're the whole point, so if you're missing them there's absolutely nothing for you. On the flipside, MCU nerds will bask in the smugness. To the tune of, ""It's a great film if you're familiar enough with the genre to appreciate it, but otherwise you can be forgiven for incorrectly thinking it's a bad film."" Folks, I'm at least 75% in this film's target audience crosshairs and let me spare you the confusion: it's a BAD film.Do you like 4th wall breaks? Oh boy, is your 15-year-old comic-con sense of humor in for a treat, because Ryan Reynolds abuses the heck out of these. You could make a sort of drinking game out of how many times Reynolds breaks the 4th wall because if one or two 4th wall breaks is hilarious, certainly 10 or 20 is comedy gold, right?In the void of zero character development, fortune cookie plot and rapid-fire wisecrack dialog that says mostly nothing, the action scenes lost all gravitas and became the usual computer-generated eye candy that gets wearisome after the first couple battles. In other words, one of the main culprits for why this entire genre has been deflating for the last several years like a 2-day-old Dollar Tree balloon. The two main characters punch, kick and stab each other endlessly, but also pointlessly, since they're pretty much invulnerable. Thus, their fights are meaningless and there's zero at stake. They could have made these fights funny or inventive or jaw-droppingly cool to make up for it. But they didn't.That's obviously subjective, but the fights are so slick, with no sense of impact, force, gravity, urgency or consequence, they're the action fight analog to American Cheese. It's a high production video game, nothing more. To obscure that we're seeing yet another who-cares superhero fight, they're set to various nostalgic pop tunes like Nsyncs Bye Bye Bye. Okay, that's a cheap gimmick but it can work. Yet unfortunately they were lazy about it. He doesn't kick three guys in a Bruce Lee ballet to the ""Bye Bye Bye"" lyrics. There's just occasional breaks in the action to watch Reynolds boy-band dance, and then it's back to the rote action. So unless you have the prerequisite awkward middle-school dance memories of circa 2000 Nsync, prepare to be underwhelmed.Also, there's a disturbing number of swords/claws stabbed into private parts, as if doing so is automatic comedy gold or edgy or envelope-pushing or who knows. It's just cheap and dumb. Such gimmicks are this film's adolescent way of reveling in its R-ratedness. If you're a veteran of PG-13 MCU films, this stabby pee pee joke humor might at least seem novel, or be evidence that the Disney MCU is ready to ""grow up"", but if you're coming from the direction of the previous DEADPOOL (already R-Rated) films or TV-M series like THE BOYS, you'll yawn and cringe at all the try-hard teenage boy badassery.This film can't decide if it's a parody, fan service or just an outright slapstick superhero movie and it succeeds at none of them. I have no idea who this movie was made for. Absolutely do not bring your friends unless they have a PhD in the last 20 years of superhero films or you'll spend an hour afterward trying to explain it all to them and sound really lame in the process. Like: ""Wolverine is wearing his costume from the comic books! Can you believe it?!""The rest of the world: ""And?""Some are saying this is the freshest take in the superhero genre in years and breathes new life into it. Not a chance. This film preaches solely to the MCU choir (a choir that is badly out of tune). It's an admittance that these films have painted themselves into a corner of lore inaccessibility and their aging millennial and gen-z audiences are bored with their ""appeal to the widest crowd"" PG-13ness. They are sound and fury and CG and endless one-upping and stakes-raising over young teenage baubles most of us have outgrown. And now, where do they go next? I don't know, but a Wolverine claw to the nuts isn't it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
111,1.0,26-Jul-24,"DEI flew out the window with this one and the quality went through the roof. I am sure that the Disney execs won't come out and say it directly, but Deadpool sure did. This movie was a non stop lampooning of the MCU post end game and it wonderfully mixed in an endless barrage of cameos. The story was nothing special, but it didn't have to be. Deadpool is all about high adrenaline action, laughs and shock value and boy did they deliver. Where does the MCU go from here? Who knows. Based on the latest trailer for Captain America that played before the movie, It looks like they are retreating from the DEI nonsense and are getting back to the basics. Maybe that is wishful thinking, but only time will tell.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
112,9.0,24-Jul-24,"Or is it Jesus ... Marvel? Well no pun intended either way! And no waiting for me either ... when the pre-orders started (quite late in Germany to be honest, compared to when it started in the US), I was not quick enough to get a ticket in the first week of its Imax run. So I thought I'd wait and go watch this on the second weekend ... well the last couple of days and the buzz around the movie, made me think twice! Why not watch it once now and then go again in a week or two!? Last movie I did that? Avengers Endgame - there may be a connection here you say? Well ... you are onto something.All that said, I was a fan of the movies in between - the MCU movies that is. Some more, some less, but I never disliked any of them. I know some feel differently and Deadpool will play into this - you know he will put his finger into anything (although finger putting is being done by someone else here - in a crazier way ... see the movie for more).Just the start of the movie is .. phenomenal to say the least. And I am not talking about the swearing or the action (blood/violence level = high) ... but also the fourth wall breaking! This is just amazing. And it gets even better along the way ... it may take a minute until we get to see Hugh ... but when we finally get to him, we are not getting rid of him.Then there are the cameos ... in the second Deadpool we already had some heavyweights ... and it only gets better from there. Some story related, some just for pure fun. Some really interesting callbacks ... some you may guess wrong once you see them ... especially the first big cameo ... I do not want to reveal say more, but it is just amazing and will blow the roof off ... not to mention what follows.While there is no nudity (apart from upper man body), there is a lot of action and violence! And really grim, dark over the top too. Also quite a lot of swearing ... we may have been accustomed to that kind of talk by Deadpool ... but there are other actors/characters who'll do exactly that ... be aware of that and don't blame the movie if you can't handle that.I've mentioned the cameos ... but I can't let go of how great they are! And that's the reason I will go watch it again - and probably edit my review to add stuff. I will not add any names though ... just thinking of that makes me giddy ... or whatever you would call it. Great soundtrack too.This will definitely be in my top list of the year ... you can blame Marvel and/or DC for many things I reckon ... but you can also take this movie and see there is a lot of good that has been done! I had not seen the trailer that were out ... I wanted to know as little as possible .. and I hope you could watch this with the same mindset ... and just enjoy it on every level (meta and otherwise) ... thank you Ryan, Hugh and Zack! And of course everyone else involved! You all Rock! Had to be said.Edit: watched it a second time and it did not lose any of its greatness (perceived or otherwise). I understand that audiences around the world feel the same way. And many have gone and watched this twice (last movie I did that for in cinemas? Endgame). Some critics on the other hand don't seem to get it.And that's ok, this movie was made for audiences to enjoy, not for high brow or much story behind it. That does not mean it does not go deep at times. Especially when it comes to being a love letter to 20th Century Fox and what it did for Ryan and other Marvel products.I talked about the great intro, but what I didn't know at the time: the song used by Nscync has a deeper meaning (as I alluded in the previous paragraph) ... and it has to do with the manager of the boy band and the song being the first one released after they cut ties with him. There is a documentary that came out recently, if you are interested in that. And the song chosen therefor is anything but a coincidence ... Ryan knows what he is doing.Comic book fans will see a lot of things in this they may love (costume(s) being just one of the many things) ... you can think of Feige what you want, but not many bosses allow their workers to poke so much fun at them and the work they do ... and his heart is in the right place. Same goes for Ryan of course.3D is a nice addition I reckon, especially the beginning ... after that you probably mostly won't notice it. And as always stick around for mid and end credit scenes ... though mid credit is again more of a love letter ... which as crazy and funny as the movie itself is, is really emotional. Rollercoaster ride for sure! Go watch it (if you are of a certain age and don't mind the humor of course)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The only criticism might be that they didn't want to put everything into this film; they cut some parts without overdoing it so that they could save something for future films.

117,9.0,10-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine opens with a nostalgic song that immediately sets a playful tone, and from there, it's classic Deadpool - witty, irreverent, and often hilarious. Wolverine fits seamlessly into the dynamic, with his gruff charm balancing Deadpool's relentless humor. However, by the time the film reaches the second and third acts, the excessive swearing starts to wear thin. While the humor remains strong, some jokes land better than others, leading to a few hit-or-miss moments.The cinematography is excellent, with stunning color grading and a mix of close-ups and medium shots that are visually appealing. The editing also deserves praise, as it effectively enhances the humor and overall flow of the film. The costume and production design are both top-notch. The locations are beautifully chosen.The VFX, while colorful and eye-pleasing, often felt artificial, which detracted from the overall experience. The abundance of pop culture references, while entertaining, sometimes pulls focus away from the main story, making the film feel overstuffed and slightly chaotic.The plot that jumps around too much, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. Moreover, the story feels overstretched, especially in the second and third acts, where the narrative starts to lose its way. The villains, unfortunately, don't add much to the film - they're cartoonish and lack depth, which undermines the stakes of the story.Overall, it's the kind of film that's so bad it's good, offering ""dumb fun"" that keeps you laughing, even if you're not sure why.

118,6.0,2-Aug-24,"With the MCU suffering a massive drop off in popularity since the Disney partnership (more diverse casting making certain sections of 'fans' angry and a wave of connected TV series' and movies creating superhero fatigue), the return of Deadpool and Wolverine (and the hillarious marketing campaign by real-life friends Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman) was seen as Marvel's saviour.Anyone worried that the MCU's Deadpool would be toned down can rest easy. The violence starts from the incredible opening credits scene, and the movie's highlight is a brilliant battle between Deadpool, Wolverine, and the Deadpool Corps. There's plenty of blood, guts, and severed body parts throughout.Though ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" has the same 'homeworkification' problem of most of the MCU. If you're not familiar with the TVA (seen in the ""Loki"" series), then the plot won't make much sense. So do your homework if you want to fully appreciate the movie.Being a Deadpool movie, there's plenty of meta humour and surprising cameos from some pre-MCU heroes, including a brilliant credits scene featuring a popular MCU star.Of course, Reynolds and Jackman both take shots at their real life personas: Reynolds has a little dig at Jackman's divorce, makes fun of himself by playing Nicepool (with no mask), and blatantly references his own movies.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The film absolutely has its funny moments and a great bromance between Jackman and Reynolds, but it's hard to get past the thought that I'm watching a 20 minute story turned into a 2 hour film. The great part about Deadpool, is that the director and producers have free rein to what they wish thanks to the leniency from the studio. They are not limited by a ""family friendly"" leash like the other Marvel films, yet it still feels like they were aiming an R rated film at 12 year olds.

Look, I get it, I'm not a marvel guy and I agree that the gargantuan presence of the MCU languishing in cinemas for the past decade and a half has been detrimental kinda to all things 'cinema', or however you and Mr. Scorsese choose to personally word it. But as much as I'm not a marvel guy, I am a meta guy in the sense that I love self aware, fourth wall breaking storytelling and boundary pushing stuff, from Last Action Hero to Scream to Wayne's World to Roger Rabbit. Ryan Reynolds is a lot of fun in the role, clearly an ongoing passion project for him, it's like his version of The Mask where he just gets to run through walls with his naturally effervescent, joyously profane presence and bounce it off of Hugh Jackman's perennially pissed off Wolverine. Even if the multiverse malarkey makes the story almost indecipherable compared to the first two films, it's just a ride you take and sort of surrender to in all its messy, mad dog glory. And the cameos? Well, some people this the multiverse angle and all the delirious nostalgia indulgence will ruin coherency and restraint in film, but I'd be lying if a few specific characters we see here from pre-MCU Marvel flicks didn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy, and sort of long for those much simpler times in the Superhero genre.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

So much to keep quiet so as not to spoil the reveals!Ryan/Deadpool at his over the top best.Hugh/Wolverine did not disappoint in ANY way, as always!So glad it is not straight to streaming.

I feel like I'd enjoy it a lot more if I'd understood all the Easter eggs I still wouldn't call it a bad watch. The film has two main features, a lot of Easter eggs for the die hard fans and a lot of jokes and gore for the less understanding audience which works but it also leaves a lot of gaps and confusion. I thought the film was slow at times but also some of the jokes really hit home. The acting wasn't too bad either and the action scenes were just a pleasure to watch, they were realistic, gory and unique. Overall not too bad.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I didn't know quite what to expect form 2024's only MCU film release but now I know it's because it literally deserves a whole year to itself. 2024 will always be know as the D&W year and in all honesty it deserves it with its DEEP DEEEEEP homages to all previous Marvel films.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
129,5.0,3-Aug-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is the long-awaited third Deadpool movie, and the dream crossover many fans have been waiting for. This has been the most hyped-up superhero film in quite some time, as superhero fatigue has settled in with the past few years. Does the film live to the hype. Fir the most part yes. If you're just looking to see Deadpool and Wolverine team up and wreak havoc together you won't be disappointed.I'm a casual Deadpool fan myself. I liked the character, but I do think he's overrated. Though, I am a major fan of Wolverine, and have always loved Hugh Jackman in the role. I personally thought the first Deadpool movie was okay but wasn't a big fan of the second. And the X-Men films are all over the map in terms of quality. Also, I've lost much of my investment in the MCU, and superhero movies in general, these past few years. So, I wasn't hugely excited for this film.Objectively, I'd say it's on the same tier as the first Deadpool movie for me. However, I enjoyed this film more, mainly for the inclusion of Wolverine. Deadpool and Wolverine have great chemistry together, and their banter is what makes the film. When the movie focuses on either of them individually, the film is just okay, but together they're a lot of fun.Seeing Hugh Jackman final dawn the comic accurate Wolverine costume was admittedly awesome. Seeing Jackman finally put on the iconic mask made me almost lose it in the theater. There are also some cameos and appearances by certain characters that I did not expect to see and each brought a smile to my face. I'm glad I only saw the teaser, and none of the trailers, going into this. For many these fanservice scenes might seem gimmicky. However, for someone who grew up watching superhero movies in the 2000s, before the MCU, this film (and No Way Home) felt like a love letter to me as a longtime fan.The film looks great, and the music is amazing. The soundtrack of this film easily rivals any of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Going in I was afraid, since Fox is now under Disney, that the violence and profanity would be significantly toned down. Thankfully, you don't have to worry about that. This is definitely a hard R, much like the previous Deadpool movies. The action is on-point. There are three action set pieces that I found just awesome to watch.I didn't love this movie though. For the same reasons I haven't loved any of the Deadpool flicks. The jokes can be hit or miss, especially when it comes to the meta humor. This is my personal preference, but I'm not the biggest fan of meta humor. A bit sprinkled in is fine, but too much can easily destroy immersion for me. The other Deadpool movies walked a fine line with that. This, like Deadpool 2, took it a bit too far. The entire plot of this movie revolves around a meta joke, kinda. As a result, I wasn't really invested in the story or what was at stake. Again, what saves this movie is the interaction between Reynolds and Jackman. The plot is the weakest aspect of it.The film does feel too long as well. After the opening scene the film does drag its feet a bit in the beginning. Also, the third act goes on for too long.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Are we so deprived of quality movies that such shenanigans as this moves the people? Just ridiculous. There is absolutely nothing to this film. I cared for nothing. Cared for nobody. The story was convoluted even for me, someone who has seen nearly every marvel movie and tv show. Blimey I can't image watching this as someone who doesn't drain their time on the marvel teeet. They must've been lost as all get out. All this film is is fan service, references, bad jokes (I mean honestly who finds this funny), and cgi action. Pointless action. Pointless swearing.

On screen Reynolds & Jackman was epic. Two absolute top tier actors and best buddies sharing the stage together for a feast is HISTORY. I was worried about the director since it's not the same from previous Deadpool movie, but man the movie really felt like a new level. More budget, feast for cameos and crazy comic accurate fight choreography and authentic suit designs felt so good to watch. This movie gives you a great time, entertains, hilarious humor and the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman was like I always dreamed it would be. I mean exactly like they performed. It was perfect !!Kudos to the writing team for pulling off a great marvel movie ( finally ) with this twisted multiverse saga it was actually a tough one. I think the plot for a bigger picture is less relevant than the adventure for this movie. People don't need to watch all marvel stuff to get this here. Of course it would make things easier. I'd say you need to watch at least the Deadpool movies to get in this movie. For the overall upcoming Avengers stuff and cameo fan service you should know more to get hyped up, but you don't miss a significant point for this movie if you haven't done the other stuff.Finally there's a villain that they didn't mess up. Frightening and Special. I want more from her.The R-Rating is godlike. Disney didn't hold Deadpool back. For all the bloody and violent action and verbal filthy dialogue you get a top Deadpool level movie. My gratitude towards the team for making it like that.I give it a 10/10 as a super hero movie, cause all the points above actually speaks volume why.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

If you are at all interested in comicbooks and the X-Men universe, you will love this movie! The movie takes all the advantages of being R-rated. Besides being a fan service movie, its story was also very consistent. The action scenes were simply magnificent. I thought I couldn't relate to this variant Wolverine, but I was completely wrong. I also remember the first time I laughed so much at a Marvel movie. Deadpool's dialogues with Wolverine were very clever. Ryan Reynolds has created a masterpiece again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
134,7.0,26-Jul-24,"Marvel, Disney, Kevin Feige, and Madonna needed this movie, badly. It's a testament to all that came before (that's what she said). A dedication to the legacy of the superhero movies that paved the way for the juggernaut of the MCU. Filmed for the geeks, the nerds, and the everyday man, like Peter Pool.Deadpool & Wolverine brings every R-rated joke, action, guts, and glory that you'd expect; but take it further just so Deadpool could rub it in Disney's face. Every quick-witted joke and one-liner hit perfectly in a rhythmic script only the Merc with a Mouth could have written. Ryan Reynolds and the brilliant Shawn Levy make a dynamic duo that was destined to lead up to this masterpiece after recent hits Free Guy and The Adam Project. This movie, with all its callbacks, head-nods, and inside joke references exemplifies the definition of a film being a slice of the time that it was made. They did what all fans of Marvel craved for-they came together to make a geek's wet dream come true.Bringing Hugh Jackman back alone qualifies this three-quel to be awesome but they took the iconic pairing to the next level with outlandish action comedy and a surprising amount of heartfelt moments throughout. Of course, there are plenty of top-tier talent in the supporting cast-whose identities will be kept under the sewn-shut mouth of X-Men Origin's Deadpool. Although what can be revealed is how much Deadpool 3 cares about respecting the legacy of the Fox X-Men universe; its characters and movies, no matter how good or bad they were, started the superhero era and deserve the credit.The hype surrounding this movie was easily bumped up by the masterfully clever marketing as Deadpool snuck into every car, beer and mattress commercial. Expectations were high but the trailers holding back spoilers helped to propel this film into a perfect storm where it blew all our minds-at once, Wade Wilson style. This story boils down to an action romantic comedy involving one immortal man-child and his Twitter-feud arch-nemesis saving the day one dirty joke at a time. It's been a long time since I've walked out of a Marvel movie feeling truly satisfied (that's what she said). At the end of the credits, after all the laughs and tears, we can definitively say that the MCU was saved by Marvel Jesus.-TE (7.25.24)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

However, this film lack that story plot but just a very plain simple story line and most of them doesn't really make much sense in the beginning.Too much referencing makes it hard to keep track if they just want to fill them all up with stuff other than Deadpool. However, it is one of my favorite since it brought up all my favorite characters, and references from other Marvel series and comics, makes it feel like I'm decorating a Christmas tree.If you want a fun movie, it is for you; if you want a movie with interesting plot and character development, sorry it is not for you.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
136,7.0,25-Jul-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is the sequel to both 2016's ""Deadpool"" and 2018's ""Deadpool 2"", and the 34th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Shawn Levy (""Night at the Museum"" trilogy, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"") and starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the lead roles, it alleviates any doubt that Disney would ruin the iconic ""Merc with a Mouth"" in a film that welcomes both him and his clawed counterpart into the MCU with open arms.Sometime after the events of ""Deadpool 2"", Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is now working as a car salesman after his application to join the Avengers was declined. One night, Wade is enjoying a surprise birthday party with his friends when he is suddenly visited by the Time Variance Authority (TVA), who forcibly take him to their headquarters to meet their high ranking agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen). While there, Mr. Paradox informs Wade that due to his previous escapades through the multiverse, he has inadvertently caused his own universe to unravel, giving him just 72 hours until everyone and everything he loves disappears forever. To prevent this from happening, Mr. Paradox tasks Wade with searching through numerous universes to find a suitable variant of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to assist him on his mission. During his journey, Wade eventually stumbles upon a disgraced, alcoholic variant of Wolverine and after some initial hostility, the two pair up to stop further damage from spreading throughout the entire multiverse.In recent years, the MCU has found itself stuck in something of a creative rut, churning out lukewarm to terrible content that is causing the interest of general audiences and longtime fans to dissipate. Though it is indeed a tall order to top the two recent ""Avengers"" films, it has since become clear that the best days of the once adored superhero franchise are now well and truly in the past. When Disney acquired 20th Century Fox in 2017, this allowed for some previously unavailable Marvel heroes to join the MCU, keeping fans hopeful that there could be some exciting new additions in the future. After some lengthy creative negotiations, we now have the first MCU film to focus entirely on heroes once owned by Fox in ""Deadpool & Wolverine"", which makes great use of both character dynamics without ever forgetting their trademark appeal.Something practically everyone knows and loves about Deadpool's character is his crude, unapologetically violent approach to getting the job done, a trait many would assume has no place within the otherwise PG-13 rated MCU. However, it is soon shown to us that this is definitely not the case this time around, as we are quickly treated to all of his signature blood, gore, swearing, and sexual innuendo that many feared would be absent after the Disney buyout. As our red-suited anti-hero playfully hums along to the opening logos, he then breaks the fourth wall in his usual fashion by directly informing the audience that a lot has happened since his previous adventure. We see him make sly references to his IP being under new ownership, the spotty legacy of the 20th Century Fox era of superhero movies, and even some self-referential jabs at the current decline in quality of the MCU itself. This is then followed up with an impressively shot, yet brutally violent action scene set to a song made famous by a popular early 2000s boyband. It was at this point I knew that Deadpool is in good hands with people who actually understand his character, at least for the time being.Similarly, Wolverine's return to the spotlight is handled rather well too. At first, I was apprehensive about revisiting the character out of fear it would diminish the perfect ending to 2017's ""Logan"", but to my relief we soon learn that this is an entirely different variation from another multiverse altogether. This variant is viewed as a complete failure in his universe, reduced to drinking his problems away hoping in vain he will eventually succumb to alcohol poisoning and die, which is impossible considering his genetic makeup. After this Wolverine and Deadpool form an uneasy alliance, we soon see their comedic dynamic come into play. Deadpool is of course the loud-mouthed, wisecracking comic relief making humorous observations to help move the plot along, and Wolverine is the disheveled straight man whose reactions to certain situations allow for him to learn from his previous mistakes. Each of the two characters are given equal amounts of screen time throughout the story, and watching them grow in their own respective ways leads to a very satisfying conclusion on both fronts.In addition to this, the action sequences never stop being fun. Director Shawn Levy frames each of these scenes with all of the same visual style as the previous two ""Deadpool"" films, littering them with graphic violence, sexual references, and the occasional funny allusion to the real-world actors playing the characters involved in the skirmish. Nothing is ever compromised for the sake of appeasing a family-friendly audience, with this film proudly wearing its R rating as a badge of honour. Best of all, there wasn't a single action scene that felt out of place or one where it was hard to tell who was fighting who. Many times I found myself genuinely invested in everything that was happening during a fight, as the outcome could seriously affect how the rest of the story was going to play out. This is something that has been missing from recent MCU films, where most of the action sequences feel pretty much the same the whole way through.Without giving away too much, it is worth mentioning that this film has a number of hidden surprises and cameos that aren't strictly limited to just the MCU. In one scene, both Deadpool and Wolverine team up with other heroes who have been absent for a very long time, which is sure to excite people in a similar manner to that portals scene in ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"". These characters were used well within the context of the story, and some of them I had almost forgotten about had this film not reminded me of their existence. Of course, I am not going to reveal who they all are due to spoilers, so all I will say is that it has me curious to see what could happen in future MCU projects if Disney ever decides to use them again.I have said it twice before and I will say it again; Ryan Reynolds was born to play the role of Wade Wilson/Deadpool. From his quick-witted observations at whatever predicament he has found himself in to his assured skills in weaponry and hand-to-hand combat, there is simply no other actor out there capable of imitating Reynolds's trademark charisma. What's also interesting here is watching how much Wade has changed in between the previous film and this one. It is established that Wade desperately longs to become one of the Avengers, naturally feeling devastated upon finding out he has been turned down by those he admires most. This has clearly affected his self-esteem, and watching Wade try to regain his signature confidence over the course of the story is a nice way to help him develop into the worthy hero he wishes to become.Likewise, it is great to see Hugh Jackman return to the role that made him into an international star. As mentioned earlier, this Wolverine is at rock bottom, having failed to meet all of the expectations required of him in his respective universe. He fully realises he has messed things up, and it is going to take somebody as determined as Deadpool to drag him out of this hole. Jackman maintains that same amount of surliness and feeling of inadequacy as all of his previous versions of Wolverine, only this time it is used to play off his comedic partner in Deadpool. Though he clearly can't stand him at first, Wolverine soon realises that Deadpool is an important catalyst towards his potential redemption, and so begrudgingly tolerates his antics throughout the film. It is here we see that Reynolds and Jackman have great chemistry with each other, with their interactions contributing many humorous and heartfelt moments that feel right at home with the MCU.For anyone still uncertain over the future of both IPs, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is sure to put most people at ease with its seamless integration into the rest of the MCU. It treats the characters with the same level of respect as their fans and it never lets up with everything that made each of them so iconic in the first place. Although I think it's a bit early to tell if the MCU has now been ""saved"" from its downward spiral, I can at least say that this film provides a highly entertaining experience regardless of which direction things end up going. At this point in time, that reason alone is something commendable.I rate it a solid 9/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A great success of the MCU by external hands that come to save a boat that was already almost sunk. Deadpool is really, as he says, Marvel's Messiah, because even though the third installment of the mercenary with the big mouth is an average movie in terms of action and the superhero subgenre itself, it's full of fanservices, cameos and surprises. The MCU needed a gory, foul-mouthed, adult movie with plenty of fast-paced action to lift its sails, now that the Guardians of the Galaxy ended their saga. This same film is responsible for giving several blows to Marvel Studios regarding its old and already failed recipes (such as the ultra-thumbed multiverse).Touching on the negative points, the general level of CGI (which has become quite controversial in the production company) was good except for one great and very important detail in the entire film: Wolverine's suit. I won't go into details so as not to unintentionally leak any spoilers, so I'll just say that it refers to Logan's suit in the third act.I'm looking forward to the inclusion of Deadpool and the X-Men in the MCU, even more so than the Fantastic Four.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

So the ""non-stop"" well choreographed fight scenes then come simply video-gamish at best and exceedingly gratuitous at worst.Emma Corrin, as Cassandra Nova, was as talented as a young Rebecca Ferguson, and was a bright spot.All in all, the movie was pure fan service and superhero fight eye candy - but nothing else.

Probably.You see 'Deadpool & Wolverine' succeeds by largely turning all of the played out MCU conventions on their collective heads. Kudos to Disney for having the courage and foresight to let Ryan Reynolds and his team do it, but there's little evidence that this will be the new template.But all of that conjecture can wait. Here and now is 'Deadpool & Wolverine', a fun (and relentless), witty (but overstuffed), fresh (yet somehow still contrived) bit of steroid-infused fan service.Is it a classic? Nah. Something I can envision ever watching again? Probably not. But this is just the sort of thing that the once powerful Marvel juggernaut (no, not *that* Juggernaut) needed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I am so tired of reviewers saying that MCU movies are full of fan service. Just who do you think they should make them for? If fans dumped literally billions and billions of dollars into my movies, I would probably try to please them! I would make the movies FOR FANS, specifically!There have been some stumbles, but it thanks to the fans that Marvel is starting to course correct. Imagine that, a company that listens to what its fantasy wants.Today's reviewers are just too jaded and constanly in search of things to be unhappy about.

157,6.0,24-Jul-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a highly entertaining film that takes some bold creative risks, making it a refreshing addition to the superhero genre. However, it does fall short in terms of plot and narrative depth.The film's formula, while familiar, is executed well. It doesn't require viewers to have an encyclopedic knowledge of the Marvel universe, which is a refreshing change from some recent entries in the franchise. This accessibility is a welcome relief for casual fans who might feel overwhelmed by the interconnected storylines and myriad characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.One of the film's greatest strengths is its unabashed fan service. Much like ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" it delights in bringing together beloved characters and playing to the audience's nostalgia and affection for the franchise. This approach ensures that the film is engaging and fun, even if it doesn't break new ground. The interactions between Deadpool and Wolverine are especially enjoyable, filled with the irreverent humor and banter that fans have come to expect from Deadpool and the gruff, no-nonsense attitude of Wolverine.However, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" does suffer from a lack of substantial plot. The narrative feels more like a series of entertaining vignettes than a cohesive story. There's a sense that the film is more concerned with delivering memorable moments and fan-pleasing scenes than with crafting a compelling, overarching plot. As a result, it can feel somewhat aimless and insubstantial.In conclusion, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a fun, enjoyable movie that succeeds in delivering fan service and entertaining character interactions. It may not be a masterpiece, but it doesn't need to be. Its primary goal is to entertain, and in that regard, it succeeds admirably. For fans of the characters, it's certainly worth a watch, even if it doesn't leave a lasting impact.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

But, other than that, that's pretty much all this movie has to offer. I love the first 2 Deadpool movies because they were movies about Deadpool. This 3rd movie is a movie about Marvel. They should just call it, Big Super Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie, cause that's pretty much what it was.So if you're looking for some good laughs, and are into the multiverse thing, this movie is for you. If you're looking for a movie with an actual plot, with good characters and good development that actually leads to a point, then this movie is not for you.I would give it 2 stars out of 5.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Their chemistry is off the charts, and you can tell they're having a ton of fun. The humor is outrageous and hilarious, with plenty of moments that had me laughing out loud. The film balances humor with some genuinely heartfelt moments. Wolverine's gruff, no-nonsense attitude is the perfect foil to Deadpool's relentless goofiness, and their dynamic is pure gold.The action scenes are top-notch, with gory, over-the-top battles that showcase both characters' unique abilities. Plus, there are some fantastic cameos that made the experience even more enjoyable. Seeing familiar faces pop up unexpectedly added an extra layer of excitement to the movie.Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a fantastic addition to the MCU and a must-watch for any fan of these iconic characters.

The first deadpool took me by surprise with the action-comedy elements. Got all of that and more. Nothing was sacred. Left some story lines hanging but hopefully this finally stops the farces of multiple universes, changing timelines and all the confusion in the last few years. Recommended for anyone who likes the genre. If you're expecting a deep drama, don't go see this. You're not the target audience. Great comments, great Easter eggs, great cameos.

The amount of 4th wall breaks and iconic cameos made this movie full of surprises and the comedy never missed. Lots of bloody, gory fun with slicing and dicing all throughout the movie. Ryan and Hugh really outdid themselves with this movie and I hope to see more from them in the future.This plot sets up a lot of potential for the future MCU and connects the other Deadpool and X-men movies to the MCU storyline.

The crazy amount of cameos from numerous former X-men characters as well as other superhero characters was so beautiful to watch and I am so appreciative that marvel and the directors took their time to really bring Deadpool full swing into the marvel universe. With that being said, I felt like Reynolds and marvel were so excited about making a rated r movie, that they forgot that there's more to movie making than swear words and debauchery. I have zero qualms with going all out, and I have never once cared about a movie having curse words, but it definitely felt like the director was almost trying to prove a point. It just felt like they were too busy trying to rub the rated r in your face rather than make a great movie. It still turned out amazing, and the story and acting was gold as ever, but it just tried too hard. It could have been even better if they would have accepted the rated r and used it without relying solely on it. Overall I loved the movie, it just felt forced and overbearing at times.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

167,6.0,3-Aug-24,"The highly anticipated pairing of Deadpool and Wolverine has finally hit the screens, and while it delivers an abundance of laughter and action, it falls short of being a truly exceptional film due to some pacing and scripting issues.One of the standout aspects of this movie is the return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who slips back into the iconic role with ease. His presence is a welcome addition to the film, and his chemistry with Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is undeniable. Reynolds, too, shines as the Merc with a Mouth, bringing his signature wit and irreverence to the role.The opening scene sets the tone for the film, showcasing an impressive action sequence that seamlessly blends humor and intensity. This tone is maintained throughout the movie, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments that will leave audiences entertained. However, some of these moments feel stretched or overly reliant on Reynolds' quick wit, which can become exhausting at times.One of the primary issues with the film is its scripting. While the dialogue is often hilarious, some of Ryan Reynolds' lines feel too heavy-handed and could have been shortened or edited down for better flow. This is particularly noticeable in the film's second act, where the pacing begins to drag due to an overabundance of exposition and meandering subplots.Despite these flaws, the film's strengths lie in its ability to balance humor and heart. The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine is genuinely engaging, and their banter is some of the film's highlights. The action sequences are also well-choreographed and visually stunning, making for an immersive viewing experience.In conclusion, while Deadpool & Wolverine is an enjoyable film with plenty of laughs and exciting moments, it falls short of being a truly exceptional movie due to some scripting and pacing issues. With some tighter editing and more concise dialogue, this film could have reached its full potential. Nonetheless, fans of both characters will find plenty to love, and the chemistry between Jackman and Reynolds makes for a compelling watch.Rating: 7/10Recommendation: If you're a fan of either Deadpool or Wolverine, or enjoy action-comedies with a healthy dose of irreverence, this film is definitely worth watching. However, viewers seeking a more streamlined narrative may find themselves slightly disappointed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The story and plot are mess and doesn't make any sense at all. The flim sometimes feels sluggish and doesn't get to the point waste so much of the time with unnecessary dialogues and jokes that sometimes work but most times make you annoyed. Villan was just bland bad and seriously I haven't seen this bad of villan in long time. I didn't watch ms Marvel so I don't know. Now this film is fun one time watch that waste too much of its time. It does not effect MCU in any way shape or form honestly. There is just one scene with Happy some mention of Avengers but that's it. Now chemistry of huge Jackman and Ryan is absolute blast.

170,1.0,31-Jul-24,"I just couldn't care less about this turd-burger of a film. Not especially worse than most of the MCU crap, but certainly not in the top-tier. And I mean, hey, if I'm being honest, a top-tier MCU film only ranks about a 7 anyway.""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film which consists almost entirely of fan-service. If you follow the comics and films so religiously that you can cite issues and pages (or seasons and episodes) like Bible-verses, then presumably this trifle is designed to flatter your knowledge endlessly. Perhaps it works in that light; I do not know.What I do know is, by normal storytelling measures, this film has absolutely nothing to offer. Every plot-development here is so arbitrary that the overall story makes no difference at all. There are no stakes, and nothing like character-development. If anyone dies, you can rest assured the Disney/MCU lot will find an arbitrary excuse to bring them back. There's just zero plot, zero story, zero character-development, zero reason to care about anything happening onscreen.But hey, there ARE a lot of quips! The overall effect is like watching a thirtysomething adult smash-together their superhero action-figures for two hours, while making R-Rated jokes about it. Funny at times, but entirely forgettable, and I'll be damned if there was anything even WORTH remembering about the story.Ultimately, it's the kind of movie which is fun in the moment, but kinda depressingly hollow upon reflection. I don't recommend it, as there are far better ways to spend two hours at a movie-theater this summer -- but see it if you must. If you're just nuts for this kinda stuff, you'll get a lot more out of it than I did.EDIT: I should have found room in my review to observe that at least half of this film is an ad for the Honda Odyssey minivan.

Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and Shawn Levy have outdone themselves, pouring their hearts into a movie that resonates on so many levels.From the first moment to the last, this film was a wild ride. The team behind it threw everything they had into making it spectacular, and it shows. This isn't just another addition to the MCU timeline or a continuation of FOX's ""X-Men"" saga; it's a love letter to all of us who grew up with these characters and have cherished their stories. Now, as adults, we get to relive that magic all over again.With Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman leading the charge, you know you're in for a treat. The laughter was relentless-I laughed so hard, my stomach hurt. The jokes are sharp and relentless; this isn't Deadpool diluted by the MCU, but Deadpool at his absolute finest. The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, with their bromance playing out in the most entertaining way possible. The story pulls at your heartstrings, especially if you're familiar with the characters' histories and their complex universes.The cameos! Oh, the cameos! Even knowing some of them beforehand didn't diminish their impact. Each appearance added another layer of excitement and nostalgia. And the supporting cast-wow. While we're undoubtedly there for the leads, the movie wouldn't be the same without the brilliant performances of the rest of the ensemble. Emma Corrin's villain, Cassandra Nova, is a standout addition. She's smart, ruthless, and brings a chilling yet humorous edge to the story.Visually, the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are some of the most creative and intense I've ever seen. Imagine adamantium swords and claws wreaking havoc in the most spectacular way possible-bloody, chaotic, and utterly mesmerizing. The music complements the visuals perfectly, enhancing every moment and sometimes making you laugh just with the choice of song.The film is an overwhelming cascade of excitement, with every scene packed to the brim with action, humor, and heart. Reynolds and Jackman's dynamic is pure gold, driving the film to incredible heights. The opening sequence alone is worth the price of admission, and there's a particular fight scene towards the end that's simply mind-boggling in its execution and sheer madness.""Deadpool & Wolverine"" has instantly become one of my top cinematic experiences. The theater was a symphony of laughter, cheers, and tears, uniting the audience in a shared journey of emotions. The movie's rewatchability is off the charts; it's perfectly paced, and you'll definitely want to catch all the details you might have missed on your first viewing. It's destined to be a box office juggernaut, and I can't wait to see it again and again.As for the post-credits scene, I'm practically bursting at the seams not to spoil it. It's epic beyond words, leaving a lasting mark on the MCU and proving that this film is far from just a fun diversion. It's a crucial, game-changing piece of the MCU puzzle, and one of its finest entries to date. The anticipation for what comes next in the MCU and for these beloved characters is through the roof.In summary, this movie is an extraordinary achievement. It's overwhelming in the best possible way, packed with everything fans could want and more. From its relentless humor and breathtaking action to its heartfelt story and unforgettable cameos, it's a rollercoaster of emotions and excitement. Reynolds, Jackman, and Levy have created something truly special, a film that not only lives up to the hype but surpasses it in every way imaginable.

The wolverine mystic was not hurt, I may even dare say it was pumped up. All the perfomances were great. Now to the dirty business. I honestly think all the writing energy was put into developing every cameo in a funny and awesome way (I flavored every cameo like a sweet fart on a cold day). Ever since the previous movie when deadpool time traveled things got messy. The plot is just cheap stuff. Besides barely making sense, it ends up being a ""Let's save the world with a happy ending while we beat a petty villian nobody will remember"" type of movie. Nevertheless, it got me laughing a lot, which is a big win for any movie lately. Deapool 1 was a 10 in my book, and I wanted that, I'm really sorry this wasn't that.

Reynolds delivers his signature snarky wit, while Jackman brings a gruff charm to Wolverine that perfectly complements Deadpool's antics.* Action-Packed: The film doesn't skimp on the action. The fight scenes are brutal and entertaining, with Deadpool's signature over-the-top violence.* Humor: The jokes land consistently, with plenty of meta-humor, pop culture references, and unexpected twists.* MCU Integration: Deadpool's entry into the MCU is handled with cleverness and respect for both the character and the franchise.What Could Be Improved: * Plot: While the story is serviceable, it takes a backseat to the characters and the action.* Pacing: The film could have benefited from a tighter edit in some places.Overall, Deadpool 3 is a must-watch for fans of the character and the MCU alike.

Deadpool decides instead to recruit other forgotten hero's (of FOX) and save the day.Suffice it to say, my expectations going in were low... I was prepared for a paper thin, nonsensical plot designed only as a vehicle for pandering cameos and non stop witty repartee between dead pool and Wolverine. Boy was I wrong. Not only is the plot logical, and compelling / but so is the villain (and her motivation). Rather than rolling my eyes at the cameos I found myself mentally demanding more! More!You never found out (in the movie) who plays female deadpool - which was a bit of a lost opportunity - but the emotional scenes were well done and the endingi?

In the league of actors that have graced the screen with comedic brilliance, and we know there have been a-plenty, Reynolds will go down in history as one of the best. The level of his smart-a** is a cut above the rest.

183,6.0,21-Aug-24,"If there was ever a duo more chaotic, more thrilling, and more unpredictable than Deadpool and Wolverine, I haven't seen it. ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" brings together two of Marvel's most beloved anti-heroes in a film that's as much a rollercoaster ride of action as it is a laugh-out-loud comedy.Plot and Storyline: The plot might not be the most intricate or profound, but it doesn't need to be. The story follows Deadpool and Wolverine as they reluctantly team up to take down a new, formidable threat. The film cleverly balances intense action sequences with moments of genuine emotion, all while maintaining the irreverent tone that Deadpool is known for. The storyline is straightforward but filled with enough twists and turns to keep viewers engaged from start to finish.Characters and Performances: Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is, as always, a perfect blend of sarcastic wit and chaotic energy. His performance is spot-on, bringing the same level of humor and charisma that fans have come to expect. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is the ideal foil to Deadpool's antics-gruff, serious, and no-nonsense. The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is undeniable, and their banter provides some of the film's best moments. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, though they are often overshadowed by the dynamic leads.Action and Special Effects: The action scenes are some of the film's highlights, with well-choreographed fights and impressive special effects. Whether it's Wolverine's brutal claw attacks or Deadpool's over-the-top acrobatics, each sequence is crafted with precision and creativity. The film doesn't shy away from violence, but it's always tempered with humor, making even the goriest scenes oddly entertaining.Humor and Dialogue: Deadpool's trademark humor is ever-present, filled with meta-jokes, fourth-wall breaks, and pop culture references. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and often laugh-out-loud funny. While some of the jokes might go over the heads of casual viewers, fans of the characters and the Marvel universe will appreciate the clever writing.Overall: ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a fun, fast-paced film that delivers exactly what it promises: high-octane action, plenty of laughs, and a healthy dose of fan service. It might not be the most groundbreaking superhero movie out there, but it's one that fans will thoroughly enjoy. If you're looking for a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and offers plenty of entertainment, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a must-watch.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
184,9.0,26-Jul-24,"Wow, how to even describe this movie?Deadpool was ceasessly introduced into the MCU. Sure, you might want to get accquited with a few MCU films first to understand what's going on, but the movie does a good enough job explaining the stakes.What you really should do homework for is the sheer amount of cameos from Fox's library of Marvel movies, from Fantastic Four to Elektra. This movie is an unbashed celebration of the history of these movies as well as the 2000's cultural milestones.And, of course, you get your sassy pansexual fourth wall demolisher and your heroic muscle man.I cannot recommend this movie enough.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
185,6.0,1-Aug-24,"Sporting more cameos than a bad mobile game advert (although Pedro Pascal doesn't show up here), 'Deadpool And Wolverine (2024)' is one of the most meta movies I can think of. Frankly, it's meta to the point that it doesn't actually exist... or, at least, it feels that way. It's the equivalent of the TVA-created limbo so much of its plot takes place in: a barren, out-of-time wasteland with no discernible features other than the remnants of long-forgotten Marvel movies/ universes. It exploits its audience's nostalgia, ostensibly acting as an ode to the Fox-era of Marvel but actually just parading around the carcasses of films that only the most loyal fans remember at all, let alone fondly. You don't even have to be all that cynical to see that its various cameos and callbacks are incredibly hollow, bereft of any real narrative significance. These things are designed to be recognised, rather than admired. The joy they evoke - which I'm not immune to, by the way - fades incredibly quickly because of this, and they lose even more power when they're inevitably robbed of the element of surprise (either by the inherently one-time nature of that element or, far more bafflingly, by Marvel's marketing department themselves).By assembling itself out of only the most memorable parts of previous movies' corpses, the picture lacks any real identity of its own. Its meta elements aren't used to comment on... well, anything really. It doesn't acknowledge it's a movie so it can say anything about filmmaking, nor about the relationship between audiences and the media they consume; it doesn't point out its place in Marvel's incredibly complex multiverse to do anything other than poke fun at the very things it indulges in, while also feeling just a smidge smug. Despite its vaguely satirical elements, it's all seems a little bit self-satisfied, and it panders to its audience in a way that's sort of off-putting. It takes things fans have loved about even Marvel's least successful efforts, and the running jokes they've created about said efforts, and transforms them into a shamelessly corporate currency that can be exchanged for cold hard cash. That this film has made so much money only further suggests that audiences don't care about story if they're bombarded by things they've seen before, which will in turn cause Disney to learn the wrong lessons and cram more cameos into their now-middling franchise instead of actually putting genuine effort into the stories of its individual entries.Of course, the less pessimistic version of all this is that Marvel is simply giving its fans what they want. Whether or not it's blatantly motivated by money instead of artistic merit, it's making people happy and that's all that matters. When it comes down to it, there's a lot of truth to that. However, you can please people while still telling a compelling story. I don't think we should accept a sub-par product simply because it scratches the same itch as well-written fan-fiction. To be fair, though, the picture isn't bad. Its flaws are far more relevant in retrospect, even though there's always something that stops you from becoming fully immersed in the experience. In the moment, the flick is fairy fun. It's oddly paced, sure, but it has plenty of diverting set-pieces and unashamedly colourful sets and costumes. The action is often exciting, although it doesn't make as much use of the eponymous characters' healing abilities as I'd like. It's generally fast-paced and filled with nice little moments that showcase the skills of the characters involved. Some of the larger battle scenes are a bit hard to follow because they're really busy and quite unfocused, but even these are peppered with those aforementioned satisfying character moments. The best fight, and highlight of the overall affair, is one set in a car that sees Deadpool and Wolverine tear each other up in a confined space (the utilisation of the environment in this scene is a deciding factor in its superiority over the bouts set on an entirely flat plane). The affair isn't as funny as either of its predecessors, but there are several amusing moments and a generally light tone that keeps you in fairly good spirits throughout. Annoyingly, a lot of the jokes amount to Deadpool simply saying something that the audience understands but nobody else in the scene does, resulting moments in which the characters stand around and wait for him to finish his schtick (or, at most, tell him to shut up). Furthermore, a lot of the humour - including plenty of the visual gags - relies on information only the most die hard fans will possess. Even the best cameos (which, for me, were the ones I didn't know were coming) sort of just happen and then disappear, fairly regularly being dismissed as a form of shock comedy.Although I spoke earlier about how the film has nothing going on beneath its surface, it does try to evoke some pathos from the (very basic) arcs of its two titular characters. The problem is that we've already seen both of them go through almost the exact same emotional journey, and one of those was in 'Logan (2017)' which is so much better than this on every conceivable level that it's almost embarrassing. The most saccharine moments try to cash in on an emotional connection that the picture simply hasn't taken the time to establish, so they end up feeling really false. There's very little emotionality here, despite some commendable work from the lead actors, and the earnestness of the affair is actually somewhat jarring; it doesn't gel with the typically sardonic tone you expect from Deadpool. Still, it's worth hammering home just how good Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are here. This is definitely Reynolds' best character, and it's always a treat to see Jackman (doubly so when he's donning his iconic claws). They do exactly what they need to, making a fairly convincing double act in the process. I just wish they actually got something to sink their teeth into, that their much-awaited team-up wasn't also a multiverse movie concerned more with mining IP than building a narrative of its own. Without them, though, there's no way this would even get made, let alone be as good as it is. The supporting players all do well with what they're given, it's just that they aren't given all that much.Ultimately, the movie is generally fairly fun but undeniably rather empty. It mostly makes good use of its R rating (it's a visceral treat to see its characters tear their enemies - and each other - apart and cuss them out while they do it), even if it doesn't exactly tell a mature tale. There's a sense that it isn't really anything, other than a collection of moments designed to make you point at the screen and say ""I remember that!"", but it also works well enough as light entertainment that I won't begrudge anyone who says they truly enjoy it. Heck, I even enjoy it (even if it doesn't seem like it). I just don't know how much. It's tempting to say that it's all set up for something later down the line, but it isn't even that really. It's just this bizarre artefact that encapsulates where the movie industry is at the moment, an uncertain time where studio heads seem to be as chronically online as their franchises' most passionate fans and continue to pander in an effort to make more money. As soulless as it may be (despite the genuine care put into it by many of its creators), it is entertaining fluff with some energetic action and a couple of solid (if rather one-note) lead performances. It's good, but it's by no means great. I wish it did more with its premise.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The Cameos are pretty awesome and the storyline is ok. The film doesn't take the MCU closer to secret wars or any other upcoming projects, However it delivers as a good addition to the Deadpool story.

It has no real story, no real structure, scenes move from one scene to the next without much continuity or reason and uses these things knowingly.However, this is deadpool and I decided my feelings on the movie should be with that in mind.It is funny. At times really funny. It looks amazing. I'm not a fan of fight scenes usually but these are fantastically choreographed and are really entertaining. Bringing wolverine in, makes no sense and yet paradoxically makes loads of sense, it completely makes the movie and Jackman plays it perfectly.If you go into this wanting to critique it as a movie as the observer did, it's rubbish. If you accept it's a deadpool movie, yeah it's decent, not as good as the first one by a long shot and most probably not even the second but it is a lot of fun and it's entertaining, though I'm not sure it's going to warrant a second viewing.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

While it is true Deadpool and Wolverine manifests a colossal fan-service, worrisome in any other context, it is precisely what the average audience needed the most; a movie that encompasses thrilling action sequences salted with alright humour and a rewarding, yet basic, plot, served as an R-Rated dish reinforced with hefty Disney budget.

Ryan Reynolds returns as Deadpool having last appeared in Deadpool 2 (2018) and Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine having bid farewell to his iconic character in Logan (2017). It was fantastic to see both actors return again. The movie was well worth the hype and it was a great experience from start to finish with plenty of non stop humour and action. A lot of question marks and concerns were going to be raised about the third Deadpool movie after Disney's takeover of 20th Century Fox but there's nothing to worry about at all. There's a lot of crude jokes and blood and gore which Deadpool is well known for.Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is enjoying making the best of a normal life until he finds himself being thrust back into the action by Mr Paradox (Matthew Macfayden) after being told his current universe is under threat of being wiped out from existence. After reluctantly agreeing to stop the threat, Deadpool also finds himself reluctantly enlisting the help of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) from another universe who is even more reluctant to join forces with the motormouthed hero. Both Deadpool and Wolverine find them forming an antagonistic alliance to face off against Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) who is the evil twin of the beloved Charles Xavier aka Professor X.There is going to be no spoilers here, otherwise it will spoil things. Deadpool & Wolverine was great from start to finish. So many laughs, non stop action, lots of jokes and Easter eggs, and Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman made a great on screen duo.

There are plenty jokes that lands, yet plenty that felt flat. Acting was... well I mean what acting? Not much required here. And it's the plot and script that felt draggy and uninspired in this film - it's kinda been there done that and it drags.Overall - plenty of good cameos, some good laughs and action scenes that do work and it's a nice film to recommend it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

In true Deadpool fashion, he decides instead to enlist Wolverine to help him save his world and everyone in it. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 films and was very excited to see this so I purposely avoided trailers and plot details as best I could.This movie is non-stop fun from the very beginning. It features numerous cameos and countless easter eggs referencing basically every Marvel movie ever made. The chemistry between Jackman and Reynolds is brilliant, and the fight scenes are incredible. The story lacks a little at times but overall, they do a good job of bringing the point home. This movie is pure entertainment and can be best described as the best kind of nerd porn.

They have my number and I know it. I like to unplug from the news and embrace the escapism. We all need escapism from time to time.The title of this movie says it all. If you have seen the Deadpool movies or the X-Men series and Wolverine spinoff this one is for you. I would guess you don't need to have seen all the movies in all the series to have fun with this one but I'm so deep in the cult it's tough to say.The writing was a little weak and formulaic but it was a comic book action movie that makes fun of its self while trying to say something about needing purpose and recognizing what drives purpose.Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was so fun to see again. He nails the role so well and they wrote his character best.If somehow you missed the spoilers, the twists and turns and cameos are fun.Deadpool's madness is more noticeable as he enters the MCU. It was fun to see the merc with the mouth go on another adventure.

I get that it's inkeeping with the character but it would help if the majority of those were funny but they rarely are & it just feels so forced. Again, I'm not against comedic moments or jokes & it did make me laugh a few times, it's just that i laughed far, far less than it really wanted or expected me to.To be honest, the best moments of the film were either it's few serious moments courtesy of Hugh & his great acting or the large scale fight scenes that were done well. I was also pleasantly surprised with Emma Corrin.The film is very much Deadpool & Wolverine in that it mostly forgets about all the other characters that played a big part in the previous films, leaving it to feel pretty disjointed from them.Overall, the film felt mostly forgettable & essentially, it was just another throwaway story set in the overused & underutilised multiverse.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Really a very entertaining fan service film. However, my advice for those of you who are not Marvel fans is to watch the film series before Deadpool, the Logan film, and the Loki series. As well as understanding Fox's dispute with Disney because you will understand 70% of the jokes in this film if you have done what I mentioned.Because if you don't, you definitely won't understand the jokes and the storyline will make you confused.

Don't get me wrong in no way am I saying the story was bad but just kinda messy.

However, everything takes an unexpected turn when the TVA takes him to help them save the timeline. He then recruits the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the only person he hopes that could help.It seems evident that the introduction of X-Men/Mutants into the MCU was planned in the context of the multiverse concept for the next saga. Even though I like the idea, I can't help but think that Marvel's decision to bring back a character with a definitive ending might be seen as a desperate move. However, given that the multiverse and variants will be central themes for phase four to six, I have no doubt that they will manage to make it work somehow. Considering the mixed reception of the current and last phases, I was afraid they would botch this up again. Thankfully, I was wrong.Deadpool & Wolverine is far from perfect, but it does provide a theater experience that people have missed since Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, if you start to think deeply about where the movie fit in the Fox timeline after the events in Days of Future Past and some pretty significant plot holes (I hope you don't), the movie starts to fall apart. I don't think those would be a big problem though. I see it as merely a continuation problem in the script because this movie is supposed to be a standalone one. Besides, it's actually a great redemption arc story for the characters. Deadpool finally gets to be the hero he always wanted to be, while Wolverine, who has let his entire kind down, has the opportunity to save countless others.After watching all the previous X-Men movies, it's finally safe to say that Hugh Jackman delivered the best performance as the beloved character he portrayed for 24 years. That one scene really stood out, and it was great to finally see him in the iconic suit. Ryan Reynolds did a great job as the Merc with a Mouth, but I feel like he wasn't quite at the same level as in Deadpool 2.All in all, Deadpool & Wolverine is like a prayer that people have been praying for years, and when it's finally here, it just feels like home.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Enjoyed the first Deadpool, did not enjoy the second.This film succeeds because instead of parading around new, obscure superheroes, and trying desperately to advance a feminist orientation, it plays what started the whole metaverse to begin with: classic superhero dudes creating mayhem and wisecracking through and through.I'm over the Ryan Reynolds shtick for the most part. It sometimes lands, but often blurs the other tones necessary to sustain a two hour movie.Lots of cameos, lots of callbacks.So, highly recommend, unless your prior favorite movie was Mary Poppins or Bring It On.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

216,9.0,15-Aug-24,"Good movie .Here's a 600-word movie review that covers Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017), focusing on their impact on the superhero genre and the performances of Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.Movie Review: Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017)The superhero genre has seen its fair share of evolution over the years, with movies ranging from light-hearted escapades to darker, more introspective tales. Deadpool (2016) and Logan (2017) stand out as two films that pushed the boundaries of what superhero movies could be, each in its own unique way. While Deadpool brought a fresh and irreverent take to the genre, Logan delivered a gritty, emotional farewell to one of its most iconic characters.Deadpool: A Game-Changer in Superhero ComedyDirected by Tim Miller and starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular character, Deadpool was a breath of fresh air in a genre that was beginning to feel formulaic. The film's success was largely due to its willingness to break the fourth wall, its R-rated humor, and its self-awareness. Ryan Reynolds, who had been attached to the character of Deadpool for years, finally got the chance to do justice to the ""Merc with a Mouth,"" and he delivered in spades.Reynolds' performance is the heart and soul of Deadpool. He effortlessly blends sarcasm, wit, and vulnerability, making Deadpool one of the most memorable characters in the superhero pantheon. The film's plot is relatively straightforward, focusing on Wade Wilson's quest for revenge after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers but a disfigured appearance. What sets Deadpool apart, however, is its tone. The film revels in its irreverence, poking fun at superhero tropes, the X-Men franchise, and even Reynolds' own career missteps.The film's action sequences are as kinetic as they are humorous, with Deadpool's acrobatics and swordplay providing a visual treat. But it's the script, co-written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, that truly shines. The dialogue is sharp, filled with quips and pop culture references that land more often than not. Deadpool doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's precisely what makes it so enjoyable. It's a film that embraces the absurdity of its premise and runs with it, resulting in a wildly entertaining ride that redefined what a superhero movie could be.Logan: A Heart-Wrenching FarewellIn stark contrast to Deadpool's irreverence, Logan (2017) is a somber, emotionally charged film that serves as a fitting conclusion to Hugh Jackman's 17-year tenure as Wolverine. Directed by James Mangold, Logan is set in a dystopian future where mutants are nearly extinct, and an aging Logan is struggling with the weight of his past. The film's tone is grim, reflective, and deeply human, offering a raw and unflinching look at the toll that years of violence have taken on the once-indestructible Wolverine.Hugh Jackman delivers a career-defining performance as Logan, portraying the character with a depth and vulnerability that had only been hinted at in previous films. His portrayal of a weary, broken man who is forced to confront his own mortality is both powerful and heartbreaking. Patrick Stewart is equally compelling as Charles Xavier, whose once-great mind is deteriorating due to a neurodegenerative disease. The relationship between Logan and Xavier forms the emotional core of the film, and their scenes together are some of the most poignant in the superhero genre.Logan eschews the typical superhero formula in favor of a more grounded, character-driven narrative. The film's violence is brutal and unrelenting, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of a life spent fighting. But amidst the bloodshed, Logan is ultimately a story about redemption and the search for peace. The introduction of Laura, a young mutant with powers similar to Logan's, adds another layer to the film's exploration of legacy and the passing of the torch.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A slight different style than the first two - tho I can't really put my finger on what they had that this one was missing.The fight scenes were amazing as always. The references to other movies, real life individuals + the cameos gave the movie an extra spark! It broke the forth wall a bit too much, but at the same time; it's deadpool, so it was expected.The sensitivity and emotions in this movie gave another feel to both deadpool and wolverine that I have missed in earlier movies.Overall it's a great movie, something nice to watch on a slow and tired Sunday.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

219,1.0,9-Aug-24,"When the very first scene of the movie has Deadpool digging out Wolverine's decomposing corpse from ""Logan"" and using it to fight a bunch of NPCs, you know you're in for something irreverent and fun. And fun, of which the movie has plenty. It's true that over the years, people have grown accustomed to Ryan Reynolds' style of humor, which since the popularity of the first ""Deadpool"" movie, has followed him around into every other movie he makes. But there's always something special when Ryan delivers the same obnoxious 'c*ck-and-b*lls' jokes wearing that loveable red suit.What convinced us all to go to the cinemas and check this movie out after the years of being sick of superhero movies however, is not Deadpool in and of itself, but the addition of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine to the mix. It's a character so beloved and one we can almost never picture anyone else in, and this movie is further proof as to why. It's a pairing that we knew would always work out well, and unsurprisingly it does. It's the banter between Deadpool and Logan that makes this movie as fun and enjoyable as it is, and credit to both actors whose chemistry was the best thing about this movie.All that being said, we're once again back to the inevitable Marvel problem of having a paper thin script which has the now banal world ending stakes it always has. It's something that has been overplayed so much that it even makes a Deadpool movie somewhat tedious. It's a Deadpool movie, so sure you're about to expect some silliness sprinkled around, but where you don't want to see it is in the blueprint of the script. And unfortunately, that's where it is, with the laziness and the lethargy of Marvel's writing department sticking around like a sore thumb.It's a movie full of banter and cameos and while that makes for an amazing theater-going experience, it's not enough to warrant longevity. The cameos are surprising, but only the first time you watch it, and that probably makes this movie the weakest of the three Deadpool movies. All criticism aside though, it's a movie worth checking out for sure while the hype is still on, because it's not going to be as fun once it's out on digital, when everyone knows what surprises to expect.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
220,1.0,21-Sep-24,"I'm a huge fan of the Wolverine films and like Hugh Jackman as an actor and person. That's the only reason I decided to watch this, as I've always found Ryan Reynolds a bit meh and was not into the Deadpool films.It's always struck me that Ryan thinks he's 100 times funnier than he actually is and that is super-amplified here. I didn't laugh once at any of his quips. They're non-stop and don't contain an ounce of wit. It just gets really tedious and annoying especially in that sarcastic, smug voice.But at least beneath the stupid jokes in the previous Deadpool films, particularly the first, there is an actual dramatic plot that is interesting to watch. This was a complete mess. The initial idea sounded interesting in the beginning but it failed to deliver on the story it promised.It's a weird mish-mash of other ideas already done over and over. I'd already been bored out of my head with the time variance plot in Loki, which they've used here as a means of getting hold of a multiverse Wolverine. There's a scene with 100 various Deadpools which we've already seen in Spiderman. And as others have said, it draws massively on other films from X-men, Marvel and other franchises to make up it's story because there's nothing to the plot. The dramatic element is drawn from your reaction to relevant moments from those films. There's not one original concept. And the fact that it's drawing on so much ultimately results in it not knowing what it's really trying to do. Thus, what ends up being the focus are the jokes, gore, fight scenes, cameos and special effects.The cameos didn't bring anything to the film. Jennifer Garner, Wesley Snipes and Dafne Keen played their roles well, but it didn't go anywhere or do anything. Weirdly Chris Evans seemed to be playing Cap rather than Johnny Storm?! And why on earth was Channing Tatum, Gambit?! And ""Cavillrine"" was just stupid.I like gory fight scenes, that didn't bother me, I was bothered by the fact that it's pointless and boring to watch because there isn't anything at stake. Deadpool and Wolverine constantly fighting throughout got incredibly tiring; I expected this film to be about the two of them grudgingly working together towards a mutual cause, whilst annoying the crap out of each other, the only time they actually did team up was at the end.About the only saving grace was the female villain who played Charles Xavier's sister; she was brilliant but it was wasted talent.Although I'd lowered my expectations accordingly with it being a film led by Deadpool, it managed to be worse than that bar. It's just a real damn shame that Hugh Jackman reprised a brilliant, iconic character for this rubbish. He at least, delivered, as you'd expect him to, but it was for nothing.I'm not the type to 1-star something to make up for all the high ratings on a film that is clearly awful, but I was sorely tempted with this. 3 for Hugh and the villain.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

229,9.0,30-Jul-24,"If ever there was a critic proof movie, then ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" surely is it. A fourth wall breaking, in-joking, buddy comedy, which bizarrely serves as a romantic finale to both the good and the terrible of defunct Fox/Marvel world.The Time Variance Authority remove Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) from his timeline and offer him a place on Earth-616, as Wilson's timeline has been slowly dying since the death of its ""anchor being"" Logan (Hugh Jackman). Using his Deadpool superhero persona, Wilson decides to save his timeline by recruiting another Logan to take his place, eventually securing a drunken failed version of him. Mr Paradox (Matthew MacFadyen) a TVA middle manager, is tired of slowly watching timelines die though and instead plans to use a device to speed up the process.It unquestionably is a case of style over substance, a rapid scattershot cavalcade of sex jokes, swearwords, references, and cameos. Occasionally, I do think that Reynolds takes the character into the realm of annoying, but I would say the majority of the time he's just about threading the needle. Jackman gets to play the straight man (in every sense) alongside the motormouth Wilson. Their fight scenes are fun, and for the most part look reasonably good, save for some dodgy CGI in the multi-Deadpool battle.Talking about the cameos is a bit too close to spoiler territory, so I'll pull away from that, but it's interesting that it finds a way to include movies that were never even made in the film. I made a special effort to avoid spoilers as much as I could going in, so some of the reveals were truly delightful to me. I would say that perhaps this offered Marvel a chance to put an end to the multiverse saga, that seems to be floundering under the weight of disgraced actors and a general sense that nothing happening in these films has consequence, if you can always pull another version of a character from the multiverse to replace the one you lost. However, the comiccon announcement seems to suggest they're embracing, rather than shying away from that.Its' a thinner and more inconsequential plot than I would have hoped for, but it's a fun ride whilst you're on it.

232,1.0,25-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is the third film in the trilogy. The first 2 films were quite successful, garnering excellent box office and good ratings from the audience. Many people remember them because of: rather vulgar and black humor, breaking the fourth wall, unexpected fanservice, excessive cruelty and of course the magnificent Ryan Reynolds. The third part in this regard does not lag behind its predecessors, I will say more - to some extent it surpassed them. And although the film is very different from the first two, it still has a similar structure, but of course there are differences, and in some moments colossal. Perhaps it was thanks to them that the third part was remembered much more vividly, but of course you should not forget that this time the film is not only about Deadpool, but also about Wolverine, which attracts all the eyes of the audience. Hugh Jackman is as beautiful as ever in the image of Wolverine, giving out another great performance. We have been waiting for his return for more than 7 years, and for good reason, because the character came out quite interesting. It was a pleasure to follow his relationship with the main character, and the cherry on the cake was his backstory. On top of everything else, I was pleased with the canonical costume and that legendary mask, it is clear that the films were shot with a soul, wanting to give fans the very multiverse of madness that everyone had dreamed of for so long. Perfectly matched music, slow mo action, the return of old characters and the insane appearance of other unexpected (sometimes insane) cameos are the soul of this film, and the warm and touching ending warms the heart. The film fully met my expectations and gave me a lot of positive emotions, which means that it works, of course it has disadvantages, but for me personally, the main disadvantage was not the greatest timing, and the rest is no longer important.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

You should probably watch the Loki series on Disney as there are lots of people from that series on there but even if you haven't they explain it through the movie anyway so it's not that important but you just won't know the characters straight away.

As the years went by, he was recruited by the TVA for a not so pleasant mission which lead him to different Earths to team up with a Wolverine variant to save his own doomed future. The film is full with action sequences specially the bloody fight scenes between Wolverine and Deadpool. The film was still able to pull off a good plot with good message but I guess what really brings this sequel to the next level are those cameos we did not see coming mixed with those we expected to see and they did not disappoint.Comparing to first DP films, this feels better than Deadpool 2.

The first film introduced us to the gritty, gruesome origin of Deadpool, and its dark tone was perfectly balanced with a fresh, comical, anything-goes style of production that we had never seen before. Ryan Reynolds nailed the role. By the time *Deadpool 2* arrived, fans were hungry for more of that same style, and not only did it deliver, but it also gave us a compelling plot with the introduction of Cable, played by Josh Brolin.However, this third movie seems to miss the mark completely. While Ryan's comedic performance is once again a highlight-and arguably the best part of the movie-after a while, the jokes start to wear thin and even become annoying. There's a time and place for everything, but in this film, it feels like nothing was taken seriously. And because Deadpool didn't take anything seriously, neither did we, which ultimately detracted from the entire experience.The cameos were fantastic, but the story itself fell flat. It was so poorly constructed that it felt like it was written by AI. I would even go so far as to say it's one of the worst plots in Marvel history. It made no sense from the beginning, and it's a shame they dragged a complex character like Wolverine into this mess.In the end, the film was dull, predictable, and annoyingly funny-not in the good way the first two were.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The hype and vibe of the film were completely correct, it is true that it did not have a story as rich as End Game's , and you should not expect it either, It had the beauty of a well-written story tho .The CEO of Marvel said that this movie is a new beginning for a new MCU age , and he was nothing but damn right about new age having been started with Deadpool and wolverineThere are millions of fans with millions of different ideas, but still, if you want to have a new experience in comedy and action, Deadpool and Wolverine is definitely worth every pennycameos are awesome.Such a gold comedy .","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It's a movie with a lot o humour, sarcasm (and specially about marvel, fox, the heroes and many more) with a lot of Easter eggs. The fights are amazing! The actors are all in the point. It's like actually they are the characters that they playing. With action, amazing animation, suspense, plot twist, things that you won't imagine will happen or you'll see. The actors have an amazing chemistry with everything! A big WARNING! The movie have a lot of spoilers for coming movies.

Humor was top notch, chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds was off the charts, action was great and story was satisfying. One of the best things was the soundtrack, all certified bangers. All the cameos were reaply nice and nothing felt forced to me. If i had to point a bad thing - or more like a less good thing - it's the antagonist. Without spoiling it, we pretty much have two antagonists, one i didnt mind and actually provided a lot of (even more) comic relief, but the other one was kinda meh. Not bad, just meh. But again, wouldnt call it bad tho.Also good performances by Ryan and Hugh, but especially Hugh, there are a couple of scenes where he went all out.Catch this one in the theater!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

246,7.0,26-Jul-24,"Watched it yesterday on the big screen. It was ... well, yeah it was fun. But a very flawed fun that could have been way better. The action was great, even if Deadpool would not constantly have pointed out that the action is great. The brawling match between the two protagonists was fun to watch, but in the end both are pretty much immortal and none of the fights really mattered so the whole thing was kind of ... dare I say it - boring. Not once was I emotionaly attached to anyone in this picture. All the cool stuff of the first movies, like 4th wall breaks, the ultra-violence and the dick and ass jokes were simply too much. After an hour or so the film just started to reference itself over and over again. I could also not quite follow the time-line story with multiverse yadda yadda. And between all the dick jokes and the 500th 4th wall break were some supposedly serious moments, but since everything seems to be a joke in this movie even these serious scenes felt too artificial.The weakesst point imho is that there is never any urgency or real threat. All characters are just mocking images of themselfs now who constantly fight NPCs who do not matter - at all.All the meta stuff going on, like mocking Fox and Disney, the millions of eastereggs, the constant talking to the audience, the critics of marvel movies(!) might have worked for me, but am I expected to know production notes now in order to get the joke? Come on. As a movie it's a five for me, but I'll add a point for trying hard to be something on its own. I do really hope this will be the tombstone of Marvel. What else could there be mocked, referenced, pointed out or milked? It's like eating at McD: You leave with a full stomach but it's never satisfying food - or food in general.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
247,2.0,26-Jul-24,"No spoilers! But let's just clear this up right at the beginning: this movie is basically 95% fan service. And if you buy into that (like I did) then you will have a fantastic time. If you don't (or if you hate Deadpool as a character) then you probably won't enjoy it as much.Aside from that though, the thing that I enjoyed most about the movie is that Deadpool feels much more like he should. I love Deadpool 1 and 2, but he always kind of felt like he stuck out in those worlds. Yeah it's the same universe as X-Men, but it felt like they wouldn't let him get TOO comic booky (and in the second movie he basically doesn't fourth wall break at all, it's just snark and pop culture references). But here though, they let it all fly, and it works brilliantly.There's fourth wall breaking, ridiculous (in a good way) fight scenes, and just general over-the-top shenanigans for the entire runtime. There's still lots of meta humor, lots of shots at Disney and Fox, but I enjoyed it. I had so much fun with this movie and haven't laughed that much in a long time.As for issues (aside from the fan service), it does feel like Deadpool gets a little sidelined at times. The movie tries to balance both him and Wolverine, and sometimes it's a little weighted in Wolverine's favor. The emotional stakes are also fairly shallow. Yeah it has them and tries to justify them (and Wolverine actually gets some good development), but it's nothing you haven't seen before and isn't going to blow you away.So if you go into this expecting Logan, you're going to be severely disappointed. But if you go in expecting a shameless fan-service filled action romp, then you'll have a grand time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It looks cheap, with flat cinematography and with the sets that look like they were filmed in a garage or at a construction site. The movie basically looks like it was made for TV and streaming. The storyline is dumb, and it borrows heavily from previous Marvel tropes, ideas and cliches about multiverse blah blah. Because neither Deadpool nor Wolverine can be killed in a conventional sense the action and the fight scenes have no real stakes or tension, and they look cartoonish. Deadpool's constant verbal diarrhea quickly gets boring and exhausting, even if it contains a decent joke every few minutes. The ""inside jokes"" about Disney, Fox or Kevin Feige didn't work for me. Wolverine is one-note throughout the entire movie - serious and pissed off. The Marvel cameos are strictly for Marvel nerds, they didn't impress me much.

254,6.0,24-Jul-24,"It's crazy...no exaggeration, and really take my ""bleh-ness"" about media overall (and especially superhero stuff), even The Boys's dark satire, into account when I say this - the meta-mea-culpa, unfiltered, unmetered insanity-mixed-with-genuine-heart-and-emotion of Deadpool & Wolverine is legitimately incredible. Insanely entertaining, and timeline-breakingly heartening and affirming. I was so ready to hate away - I've been conditioned to. But genuinely, the best superhero-genre film since, I feel like saying Dark Knight. That's at least how I feel right now. So many Disney/MCU meta-self-stabs, worth the ticket price alone. Ryan got full control of everything said, it's very clear. I'll call it now that it's making over 2B - this catharsis of 'superhero films are just bad nowadays aren't they' growing since Endgame, *actually* addressed in the film. Tight editing too, and Matt McFadyen nails it. A lot of fun had making it, it's clear. So much laughter and cheering in the packed cinema - an audience that felt seen and met where they are, frustrated/tired/jaded/confused, instead of bludgeoned obliviously/arrogantly yet again with another confusing overwrought MCU slog. This film is *with* the audience, and (without any spoilers) literally kills all the confusion and bloat of the past 5 years in one swoop. You'll genuinely love it. I'd love to go see it again. It's actually insane - the film would literally not be as effective or entertaining if Marvel *hadn't* bloat-fested and over-indulged for the past few years, because the fact they actually did that (and messed up as bad as they have) *made* this film. The conceit is so clever, it makes it feel like all that was intentional, just to justify this film and its premise of meta-apologising/meta-scrapping-and-starting again. Genuinely impressed - if this is the last MCU film I watch I'll be truly glad of it. If they keep up this quality though, and stop funding/favouring harmful entities, we could actually return to pre-Endgame levels of appreciation for the genre. I would love them to see how much people appreciate their mistake-owning in film form, so that they make actually mistake-owning and apologising moves in real life.

For me it's kind of a one-time deal that's filled with sophomoric humor, gags, some good action and that's that. But this basically amps it up an another notch or two and it gets a little tedious towards the end. It's also openly sacrilegious so just know that going in. Hugh Jackman is very good in it though and there were some pretty funny gags at times. For me it all just got to be too much as the film progressed.

257,2.0,26-Jul-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" offers a mixed bag of entertainment, capturing some of the zany charm that fans of Deadpool have come to expect, largely thanks to Ryan Reynolds' comedic flair and the numerous cameos sprinkled throughout the film. These elements certainly inject a dose of fun and levity, making the movie enjoyable in parts.However, the movie falls short compared to the classic Marvel films of earlier days. The storyline is thin, with the inclusion of the TVA and the multiverse feeling more confusing and irritating than exciting. The villain, a rather bland and underdeveloped character, lacks depth and screen time, failing to leave a lasting impression.Despite these flaws, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" manages to surpass the likes of ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,"" and is certainly a step up from ""Ms. Marvel.""

There was nothing at stake and it just felt like the kind of lazy writing Deadpool mocked in the first movie. A superhero movie is only as good as its villain and despite Emma Corrin's great performance the movie didn't really do her character justice.This movie was mostly about fan service, as a fan myself, I think they delivered 100%.

260,1.0,30-Sep-24,"I absolutely loved the first Deadpool-it was witty, funny, intelligent, and a real breath of fresh air.But unfortunately, they've managed to ruin it this time around.I enjoy a good action movie with humor and clever jokes, but they went way overboard with the profanity in this one. It felt like there was an unnecessary F-bomb every two seconds, and it quickly became repetitive and unfunny.The multiverse concept that has been driving the MCU lately is really starting to wear thin. When you have a thousand versions of the same character, it becomes hard to care about what happens to any of them.I hate this multiverse concept deeply.There was also almost no storyline here, just over-the-top action scenes with an overly angry Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds, countless cameos, and non-stop profanity, which all felt like a distraction from the lack of actual plot.A good action movie doesn't need to be a hyper-violent bloodbath, but this film seemed to think otherwise. The violence felt excessive and unnecessary, and it didn't serve the story in any meaningful way.I like Quentin Tarantino movies, so i'm not sensible about the matter if it serves the story.It reminded me of what happened with Thor: Love and Thunder-just like that movie, they tried too hard to replicate the magic of Thor: Ragnarok, but ended up failing, They made exact same mistakes.Honestly, the only aspect of this movie that was done right was the marketing campaign.And as for that dog licking Deadpool's mouth repeatedly? It was just plain disgusting.I'm done with the MCU, They were done after Infinity War, i just kept giving them chances one after another.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I don't know if that hurt my ability to enjoy the film or not, but after coming out of the showing I felt it was overhyped for what was produced. The story isn't anything special, and the villain is cool to see but comes out mediocre.Some of the sequences are over the top and excessive in the humour they produce. They start off enjoyable, but because they continue beyond appropriate enjoyment, my laughter started to die down. However, there are a lot of good parts that are funny and laughter ranges from little snorts to complete chuckles.The action and aggression that comes with the film are good, but they're lumped into parts instead of spread out to continue the enjoyment so boredom kicks in. Visually the film is just enjoyable especially in 3D. The violence and blood is excessive, but doesn't ruin the film.The chemistry between Hugh and Ryan is amazing. I loved seeing them on the screen together and their banter is enjoyable. I also liked the cameos that come throughout, and some of the easter eggs that I was able to catch.Overall, a slightly overhyped film that still entertains. I wish I could be more specific on things, but I don't want to ruin or spoil the film for anyone. Action is too lumped instead of spread out, the comedy is both lumped, but also spread out to maintain a form of laughter throughout.

It was as if they were just throwing random ideas together without any regard for coherence. One moment you're in one setting, the next you're somewhere else with zero explanation. It was like a bunch of disconnected scenes stitched together.There was no heart in this movie whatsoever. I didn't feel anything for the characters or their supposed struggles. It lacked any depth, emotion, or real stakes. It's like they forgot that great superhero films need some kind of emotional core to keep the audience invested. This was just mindless action without purpose.And the humor? It fell completely flat. Just because you throw in a ton of cursing doesn't automatically make something funny. It felt like a teenager trying too hard to be edgy, with juvenile jokes that made me cringe more than laugh. The whole thing had the feel of a script written by a 12-year-old who thinks swearing is the peak of comedy.Overall, this movie was a huge letdown.

With a cameo that I did not see coming at all and when you watch the movie you probably will know what one it is.To sum up. This is a fantastic return to form for Marvel and yet another great outing from Reynolds favourite character.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
277,1.0,27-Jul-24,"This is a tough one. On the one hand, I think the movie is exactly what most people want from it - Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman hanging out, making jokes, and having a good time in the MCU. If that's all you're looking for, this movie absolutely delivers and it's well worth the price of admission. On the other hand... it's easily the worst of the three Deadpool movies.Deadpool is ostensibly doing everything he's doing in this movie in order to save his loved ones - all of the aforementioned supporting players from earlier Deadpool movies - characters like Yukio, Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Colossus, Vanessa, Blind Al, Dopinder, etc etc. However, only one of these supporting characters from the previous two Deadpool movies gets more than 2 minutes screen time, many of the rest don't even get lines. Instead, this movie replaces those supporting players for cameos from various failed Marvel projects - often for nothing more than a single joke or lazy nostalgic references. The idea is that these characters will finally be given the opportunity to have the send off / swan song they were previously denied in their own movies - but... none of them really get to enjoy that. They're just used in a fight montage that basically doesn't matter at all in the grand scheme of things.I can't help but feel like this would have been a much better movie had it traded the mostly ridiculous cameos in favor of involving the supporting Deadpool characters we've all come to love over the past two movies.I enjoyed the jokes for the most part, and it's good to see Disney embrace the rated R label for something like this - but the movie ultimately kind of fell flat as a whole.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
278,9.0,2-Aug-24,"Before watching the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect of a Deadpool & Wolverine movie. I have watched Deadpool 1 and 2 and really liked it (the first one more than the sequel) but this one is really massive! A lot of action and a lot of good jokes, there was many moments where the audience were just bursting out laughing. I mean, don't look at me I was next to my younger brother and I was honestly a little embarrassed of how some of the jokes were a bit too spicy but legendary in laughter! I think I really want to watch another movie with these two, they make an incredible team. I like how Deadpool is the funny always talking kinda guy and Wolverine is just there dropping f bombs and acting like he is sick of everything. Would recommend everyone watches this movie on a big screen it really makes a difference! I watched it on iMax and it was lit!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
279,1.0,28-Jul-24,"This isn't a WIDE APPEAL movie, it has those elements, but this clearly was made for the nerds and marvel loyalists. Which isn't a bad thing, just means if you're like me and don't get all 1000 references, it's going to be a bumpy ride for you. I got a lot of them. It suffers the Rick and Morty, Smiling Friends, current era humor problem of needing 100 jokes per minute and as such there's really a weak semblance of a plot and story. It was weirdly ""CUTE"" which given the amount of swearing and violence, is weird to say. I wouldn't say I regretted seeing it opening day, but would say, this is a STREAMING movie. That way you can rewind parts to see the jokes and easter eggs you've missed.The pros: -Obviously the CHEMISTRY between two of the nicest people in Hollywood from what I've heard. It's great. Though they did have a few character breaks where it clearly was like take 100 and they didn't have the budget to retake something anymore so you'll catch a Hugh Jackman smirk here or there when he's supposed to be pissed off. Pretty sure Happy Hogan has a MAJOR character break in his scene.-Decent effects -Good jokes -Some obscure out of left field references, like the ""Leifeld Foot Store"". Rob Leifeld co-created Deadpool.Cons: -Over stays its welcome -Blind old lady that's hood is kind of a tired old trope, I mean Airplane did that joke and it was getting old by that point. It's like getting a child to say bad things.-Story is so who cares and you can tell, since it relies way more on plot conveniences than logic.-Music was trying way too hard to be LOL RANDOM. ""Isn't it funny we're playing a pop song from the 90s and early 2000s while slaughtering a hoard of people?""Overall If you're a comic fan, and a fan of the first two, you'll like it.

280,1.0,11-Aug-24,"It's embarrassing to see this rated at eight stars. The first was a genius masterpiece. Witty, funny, likable characters, and you could see the effort all over the film for the full running time.The second film breaks the fourth wall yet more. Ryan Reynolds keeps talking about being the underdog, playing the likable guy who has an ongoing beef with Wolverine and Hugh Jackman occasionally, okay, that's funny. But there was too much effort into trying to make Deadpool into a billion dollar franchise with numerous spin-offs, etc etc. As a result, while the film had its moments, it definitely suffered with its focus on how to maximize the money and the depth the storyline.Come the third film and there is no fourth wall anymore. It's not an occasional fun moment. Wolverine isn't even Wolverine. It's just Jackman in a wolverine suit pretending to be angry with Reynolds because this was never, ever, ever, ever, ever going to happen. But now it happens, what a surprise. These guys apparently know that there are millions of desperate people around the world waiting to put the two of them together in a film and laugh about these oh so clever in jokes and be able to say how funny they are.Well the in jokes aren't that funny at all. They are told over and over and over. Wolverine had absolutely nothing interesting to say and just dropped the f-bomb, bub, and short short angry blurbs in order to provoke numerous cgi fights repeat themselves. The joke is on the audience. The story was dumb. The cameos were pretty dumb. Lots of cursing for the sake of cursing and then laughing like 5-year-olds that they were able to do it in a Disney film. Oh wow.The wit and smart jokes are gone. It's now full-fledged franchise with multiple other actors being Ryan reynolds's best friend because he's gifted them with their own spin-off superhero movie that will get greenlighted as a result of this film. It's totally mindless. It may take another film for people to realize, but this is really an unbelievably poor film that sets a low barrier for effort.

The actors did an amazing job at bringing these beloved characters alive and portrayed them as expected, Hugh Jackman is the only Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds is Deadpool.The storyline of this movie was clear and well thought out, and unexpected moments were met with applause from the audience. Also, the comedy was actually funny this time around, lately, Marvel comedy has felt very forced, but this felt like a breath of fresh air. And another thing that I want to point out, is the soundtrack and sound design... PHENOMENAL!!!!! I found myself singing along to the songs and they added just that final touch to the scene, and the sound design was CRISP.Overall, please go and see this movie, it won't disappoint you.

But, they're wrong. Deadpool is, and always has been, an irreverent character that takes personal shots at the writers, producers, and even the artists that have created him. This film is no different.Is it a classic Marvel movie? No. Is it a regular down to earth Deadpool movie? No. Is it an X-Men movie? No. It's more than that. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman bring this buddy-cop film across the multiverse to life and bring in some surprising cameos and make fun of and potentially set up the next great Avengers film with Secret Wars. Even if this is the end (which would be ending on a high note) they nailed it. Fan fare is what the people want, and then they complain when they get it.People like to complain that movies are just fanfare and cameos, and then complain when there isn't enough fanfare and cameos. Watch it for yourself. And love every minute of it.Ryan and Hugh are the best at what they do, and what Deadpool and Wolverine do isn't very nice.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Otherwise they were well written.The story seemed a bit weak. In my opinion there wasn't a clear goal where the story was going. At least I feel the previous too were much more engaging and there was a clear direction and you as the viewer got engaged.

Deadpool & Wolverine: The Snarkiest Show on Earth is exactly what you'd expect - a delightfully chaotic, fourth-wall-breaking, profanity-laced romp that somehow manages to be both mindless fun and surprisingly heartwarming.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman clearly had a blast reprising their iconic roles, and their on-screen chemistry is so palpable you can practically smell the testosterone and sarcasm wafting through the theater. The plot is basically just an excuse for these two egomaniacs to one-up each other in increasingly ridiculous ways, but who cares when the results are this entertaining?Sure, the action sequences are a bit over-the-top (even for a superhero movie), the jokes sometimes land with all the subtlety of a Juggernaut to the face, and the whole thing is about as subtle as a Deadpool to the, well, you get the idea. But if you're looking for a cinematic experience that will make your inner 12-year-old giggle uncontrollably while your outer 30-something cringes, this is the film for you.Just don't bring the kids - unless you want them asking some very uncomfortable questions afterwards.

287,4.0,24-Jul-24,"This is a difficult movie to assess. My initial thinking was that one of these after six years is fine and I think this is in some ways a welcome return to form. On the other hand, the idea of the multiverse, which has already been overplayed, is in force here. Not on the same level as, for example, the second Dr. Strange movie, but still it is here. They are smart enough to make fun of it, but even if you are satirizing and commenting on something by doing that very thing, you are still doing that very thing.Same with fan service. The movie is both doing it and making fun of it. They brought back so many characters from the past. This kind of meta-irony doesn't really work for me as it has become a cliche on to itself. At the same time, it is Deadpool, so I kind of signed up for this specifically. I do admit that there was one little-more-than-a-cameo that was actually done in a very cool way (and as far as I knew, they managed to keep it a secret this time).Sure, there is stuff in this movie that gets me, but I'm easy that way. I'll cry for anything with weepy enough soundtrack. But again, there's one of these things that really works for me within all the noise.Deadpool movies haven't really needed a good villain, but Cassandra Nova works pretty well and they do some cool things with her powers here. Also, I always enjoy it when the actor seems to relish the role and that's definitely the case here.In the end, there's a lot of things to like. Pretty every scene is good on it's own, but the whole feels messy and unfocused... or more like focused on the wrong things. I liked it, but I don't see this as being the course correction MCU so dearly needs.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It was pandering too much to the fans, but that's what Deadpool's always been. I feel by far this is the best entry in the Deadpool genre and not just because Hugh Jackman's in it.The movie is a roller coaster that doesn't stop at all, but the storyline is very good, there's a lot of emotion in certain scenes. So besides the fact that it's funny, it does take moments to be serious that pull at your heartstrings.The acting and the graphics were great!

The marketing was so fun.So I was a bit sad that I left the cinema feeling a bit ... nothing.Now, that's not to say this is a bad movie. It is still entertaining. But it felt off and I'm not 100% sure why. I laughed, many times. Some jokes were really top tier too. But many jokes went longer than they should (Deadpool being suited up at the TVA comes to mind). The cameos were pretty cool (looking at you Vampire man) but were ultimately nostalgic cut ins with no emotion value at all. There was no time to gain a sense of comradery from any of them. They were either there for a cheap joke, or push the plot forward enough before being left behind. I know it's Deadpool ""and"" Wolverine. But could've had solid ground with other characters. DP2 managed it.The only thing I hated was the Venessa side story. Not only was it basically a couple of lines that followed the movie tendency to pump and dump. But the whole thing didn't feel like anything either character would do. It just didn't feel right. And Venessa deserves better (And more screen time).I enjoyed seeing Logan again. The movie intro dance was great. The fight scenes were great, though the music choices felt strange, like someone said: ""hey, I like this song, and it's a whacky choice coupled with fight scenes, lets add it"". I enjoyed the villain (even if she seemed to overdo it a bit) ... Vampire dude and purple bomber!Over all, watchable, but not something I'd go out of my way to watch again (I might grab a physical copy to complete my collection though - ooh, wait, I can't cause Disney stopped making physical media for Australia)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The creators knew how to hold their card til just the right moment and the payoff was major. Big laughs from everyone in the audience and for once they felt natural to the characters.Speaking of which, a surprising amount of chemistry from Reynolds and Jackman.

Exploring Wolverine's struggle with his past and Deadpool's search for purpose could add layers of complexity to the story. Their evolving friendship would be a central theme, highlighting their mutual respect and understanding.In summary, a film combining Deadpool and Wolverine would be a chaotic, hilarious, and action-packed ride.

Yes.I'm tempted to say this is a worthy cinematic experience.. ONLY because part of me understands this follows in-line with what Far From Home did and what it offered it's audience (enjoying it before somebody ruins it for you). Not because the plot was particularly memorable or well made! But because it rocks an excellent cast of surprises and has Cameos that are exactly what the latest Dr Strange's attempt wanted to be (giving a chance to something meaningful)! Not to mention excellent action choreographies, and how it works as a lovely farewell to a part of the Fox's Marvel entries.Personally, I felt the pacing was too slow in parts, and the movie a tad long. Some of the dialogue becomes tiring after a point, and the well-casted villain becomes an unnecessary cliché after a point.. just for the movie to have an ending. I was also sadly-reminded of the pointless Loki and all it entails. Also, it becomes a bit overindulging at the end, and the CGI gets progressively worse. I think that if the story is good, the CGI's quality shouldn't matter as much, as it serves a purpose to raise one's imagination and help the narrative visually. For this movie, I probably started to notice or care about it, because after a certain point the story is just whatever.But still!

305,8.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine' is undoubtedly the most anticipated film of the year for many. A year that is now starting to pick up in terms of high-quality movies, and a Phase that has seen Marvel Studios struggle needed this film to succeed, and not just in terms of box office numbers. The Deadpool films have always been known for cheeky humor and legendary fourth wall breaks, but also for well-crafted action comedies that gave audiences what they wanted. Since 20th Century Fox, the studio behind those first two movies and that of X-Men, got bought out by Disney in 2019, many and I wondered how the merc's new home would go about maintaining the spirit of the character. Worries also revolve around how they could bring back Wolverine without tainting his legendary ending in 'Logan.' Was this third installment able to live up to expectations, and possibly exceed them? Yes.Except for one scene with shaky cam, the action was great, especially the expected fight between Deadpool and Wolverine. Shawn Levy knows how to direct entertaining and bloody action scenes. It showed in 'Free Guy,' and it shows here!Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are fantastic as their respective characters. After fifteen years of having to deal with their appearance in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine,' this is the team-up we've all been waiting for. Ryan Reynolds has proven himself reliably great as Deadpool, while Hugh Jackman channels in his prior work as Wolverine while also portraying a complex, different version of the character.The cameos range from expected to mind-blowing. I'm glad I binged all of the X-Men movies prior and most of the other Fox/Marvel movies except for 'Elektra' and the 2015 'Fantastic Four.' I won't say anything else for the risk of spoiling it, but believe me, it's a multiverse movie that understands when to implement cameos and pays tribute to the legacy of the Fox/Marvel films.Other than that, the fourth-wall breaks are iconic, Cassandra Nova is a good villain, the CGI is great, and the movie ends satisfyingly and excitingly.Overall, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' delivers what I expected and more! Now and then, I don't expect this film to ""save the MCU,"" but it manages to be a phenomenal farewell to the characters of Deadpool and Wolverine (for a second time).For the technical score, my only issue is that one action scene with shaky cam, which leads to it being a 9/10. Technically not the best film of the year, as films like 'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,' 'Late Night with the Devil,' and 'Longlegs' have more merit. For the enjoyment score, Deadpool & Wolverine is the most reliably entertaining film of the year that I'll buy once it's on Digital. 10/10. You were probably going to see it anyway, and for good reason! It's damn fun!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
306,7.0,27-Jul-24,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom's better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering's predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy's latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don't. I suppose that's not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren't bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture's credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise's historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn't serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I'd truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
307,5.0,30-Jul-24,"This is a movie where the story aren't the strongest carrying the movie being the primary motor carrying the movie forward, but it's one of those movies where it's not the point of it. This is a movie for the fans, fans of Deadpool, fans of Marvel, and fans of the unmature humor we can enjoy without shame while watching the movie8/10 stars, it would have been a 10 if the story had been developed more seriously, but I didn't had any longing for it while watching it.It's funny, and more funny, silly and stupid the right way, and of course Deadpool's meta level makes it worth every dime.As someone said; it's easter egg galore, and couldn't be said more fitting :D.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
308,8.0,18-Aug-24,"Despite some strong actors and a little more than a half dozen genuinely funny jokes, 'Dead Pool & Wolverine' doesn't hold up to expectations.First, there is far too much emphasis on Ryan Reynolds. It seems like to makers of this film forgot that Dead Pool is the main character. Breaking of the fourth wall is used far too often, and more often than not it feels like Ryan Reynolds is speaking to the audience rather than Dead Pool.Second, there is far too much exposition. It rivals anime in the unnecessary or repetitive dialogue explaining things.Third, there is the inconsistent quality of CGI across the filmFinally, the jokes about Marvel and Disney not only undermine the suspension of disbelief the same way as Ryan Reynold references do, but they also go on too long. Well into the second act. This may have been meant to be satirical or ""meta"" but it ultimately makes for long boring stretches of the film.All in all, it's not as bad as Dead Pool 2 in some ways, but it is far worse in others. Hopefully this will be the last we see of Dead Pool in the MCU.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
309,9.0,11-Aug-24,"This film had to go through many problems to be made. Film studios, characters, actors, directors, scripts, but I'm very glad that it worked out in the end. Technically speaking, this is Deadpool 3. The film had strong marketing, a high budget, but it will also make money.The film gave me everything I expected, wanted and hoped for. I smiled on several occasions, laughed out loud, enjoyed the action. This is pure 100 percent fan film, fan service, there is no doubt about it. But we needed one successful superhero movie after several years of (mostly) big flops.Far from this being the best movie ever or anything like that, it won't even be the best movie of the year. We can talk about the action and the story, but that is unnecessary, that is not the point of the film. This is an action-packed summer blockbuster for fun and relaxation. Clearly, the film has several action scenes and very bloody ones (it justifies its R rating), but they are brilliantly filmed. Also, for me, the best part of the film is certainly the numerous cameo roles, references (Easter eggs) and mockery of anything and everything that is current now or has been in the last 20 years. That was exactly the point of the film.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are great in their roles and have great chemistry in their scenes together, which is almost the entire movie. We even got a little touch of movie nostalgia because the subgenre of duos who can't work together because they're different but have to, which was very popular 30-40 years ago, is practically extinct today (eg Lethal Weapon).The only thing I don't know is whether you will catch all the jokes, taunts and references because I have the feeling that there were about a hundred of them, without exaggeration.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
310,9.0,2-Aug-24,"Disney marvel movies always seem to struggle at finding the right balance between being entertaining and having a good story.It is clear from the opening act that D&W was made with the intent of entertaining the wider audience and providing great fan service to the more hardcore fans.However, this is no Deadpool 3... The events of first and second movie are largely ignored, due to a time skip. When we do hear about the aftermath of the second movie, it serves very little purpose. It feels as if there should have been a movie inbetween Deadpool 2 and D&W leading to the present events.The motivations also feel all over the place. Both Deadpool and Wolverine do not really go through much character development other than feeling a certain way to then feeling the opposite (very basic and there was never any depth to it). Any serious conversations that characters had lost a lot of emotion due to the fact you know it's building up to some sort of punchline.The movie is, extremely entertaining though. If you are prepared to leave your brain outside the theatre, unwind, and enjoy 2 hours of laughs and blood then you will have a really enjoyable time. The jokes hit, 80% of the time (which is a great ratio for MCU movies nowadays). The cameos are great, and the visuals and fight scenes are great too.Overall, this movie is a wholesome end to the Fox marvel universe.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
311,1.0,26-Jul-24,"The much-anticipated team-up of Deadpool and Wolverine unfortunately falls flat in this latest installment. The plot is a mess, feeling more like a lazy patchwork of ideas rather than a cohesive story. It lacked the sharpness and wit we've come to expect from both characters.One of the biggest issues was the overuse of jokes. While humor is a staple of Deadpool's character, this movie bombards the audience with too many gags, many of which simply don't land. The humor often feels forced, detracting from the overall experience.That said, there were still some funny moments that I enjoyed, showcasing the chemistry between Deadpool and Wolverine. However, these moments are few and far between, buried under an otherwise forgettable plot.In comparison to the previous movies, this is definitely the weakest. The film struggles to find its footing and fails to deliver the engaging narrative that fans hoped for.

Constant jokes, over the top violence and Breaking of the 4th wall really makes this movie worth watching.Its worth noting that this movie gravity relies on the viewer being caught up within the MCU. You really wont get the full experience without having watched, or at least have knowlage of the previous X-men movies (specifilly «Logan»), as well as the Marvel movies and series (mainly Loki).All in all «Deadpool&Wolverine» is a funny, actionpacked and awesome piece of fan service which surpasses any previous Marvel media all the way back to endgame.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

315,1.0,29-Jul-24,"Was amazing with lots of humour. Deadpool and Wolverine, two of Marvel's most iconic characters, have captivated audiences for decades with their unique personalities and compelling stories. Their journey through comic books, movies, and other media has left an indelible mark on popular culture, and their impact is nothing short of amazing.Deadpool, also known as Wade Wilson, stands out as one of the most unconventional heroes in the Marvel Universe. Known for his sharp wit, irreverent humor, and breaking the fourth wall, Deadpool has redefined what it means to be a superhero. His self-aware commentary and unpredictable nature make him both endearing and entertaining. Deadpool's origin story, filled with dark humor and a mix of tragedy and comedy, highlights his resilience and unconventional heroism. His ability to heal rapidly and his penchant for chaotic antics set him apart from traditional heroes, making him a beloved character for those who enjoy a blend of action and comedy.On the other hand, Wolverine, or Logan, is a character who embodies raw strength, complexity, and grit. With his adamantium claws and healing factor, Wolverine is a formidable warrior, yet it is his internal struggles and moral ambiguity that make him truly compelling. His backstory, laden with loss, conflict, and an ever-present search for identity, adds depth to his character. Wolverine's journey from a weapon of destruction to a hero with a code of honor resonates with audiences on a profound level. His relentless pursuit of justice, coupled with his inner turmoil, creates a multi-dimensional character who is both powerful and vulnerable.Both characters have been brought to life on the big screen with remarkable success. Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of Deadpool is a testament to his ability to perfectly capture the character's eccentricity and humor. Reynolds' commitment to staying true to Deadpool's irreverent nature has earned widespread acclaim, making the character a standout in the realm of superhero films. The ""Deadpool"" movies broke the mold of traditional superhero films, incorporating a unique blend of comedy and action that appealed to a diverse audience.Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is equally remarkable. Jackman's performance, spanning multiple films over nearly two decades, has set a high standard for portraying complex, layered characters. His portrayal of Wolverine's physicality, emotional depth, and conflicted nature has been widely praised, making him one of the most memorable characters in modern cinema. The ""Logan"" film, in particular, showcased a more vulnerable side of Wolverine, providing a poignant and fitting end to Jackman's portrayal of the character.The chemistry between Deadpool and Wolverine has also been a highlight for fans. Their interactions, characterized by a mix of tension, camaraderie, and humor, underscore the contrasts between their personalities while celebrating their shared heroism. Their dynamic adds an extra layer of enjoyment for fans who appreciate both characters' distinct approaches to heroism.In summary, Deadpool and Wolverine are remarkable not only for their superhuman abilities but also for their richly developed personalities and the unique ways they challenge conventional superhero tropes. Their portrayals in both comic books and films have captivated audiences, making them enduring symbols of complexity and entertainment in the superhero genre. Their ability to resonate with audiences through humor, action, and emotional depth solidifies their place as two of the most compelling characters in modern popular culture.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
316,6.0,15-Aug-24,"For a moment it seems like ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" will manage to get away with it's multiverse story. Raising it's eyebrow to the idea that every world has a hero that is fundamental to its survival. Hence the search for a new Logan.But no. It doesn't. Just like all the multiverse movies that came before, it skips around abstract worlds, introducing unbelievable characters and situations, and destroying any possible drama.But that's probably not why you watch a Deadpool movie. You watch it for the jokes, the smut and the fourth-wall breaks. Of which there are plenty. This installment also has a long list of cameo appearances, none of which disappoint, with a handful being true highlights of the film (I won't name names to avoid any spoilers).Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine straight, with lots of slice-n-dice fight sequences. But he is definitely the support act rather than the co-lead. This film is all about Ryan Reynolds - or at least, whoever wears the red and black costume.Back to the ""story"", Matthew McFadyen is OK as the first British baddie. Emma Corrin is really poor as the second British baddie and never manages to find the right tone.To sum up, the laughs are there, the action is good but repetitive, and the story isn't even worth trying to make sense of. Which is why this film isn't a match for the previous two Deadpool adventures.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

324,6.0,25-Jul-24,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes 'Deadpool & Wolverine' an excellent watch!There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. 'Deadpool 2', but here the humour is executed perfectly.Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

Deadpool 1 especially could stand on its own. This movie is different. Don't get me wrong, it's funny, and I love it for what it is, but there's a reason it's not called Deadpool 3. The plot is all over the place and the multiverse aspect (combined with the fact that they can both regenerate) makes the stakes non-existent.

332,6.0,2-Sep-24,"I have purposely avoided the comic book genre of movies for the last few decades since I view them as infantile. Superpowers, extended battles, ridiculous physics (or lack thereof), binary good vs evil characters...perhaps if I were still a 10-year old boy I might enjoy that monotony. Of course there were some classics like 1989's Batman which elevated themselves beyond just a ""superhero"" movie. But I have been happy to ignore the deluge since that time.Unfortunately I was dragged in to see this Deadpool / Wolverine abomination recently, and I feel compelled to express my dismay.Yikes. Is this what the moviegoing public is cool with? Most of it is simply a series of extremely graphic mass murder sequences set to upbeat music, juvenile jokes (I didn't laugh once), swearing, and the usual ridiculous CGI jumping through dimensions or whatever. Whatever ""plot"" there was, I missed it because it was complete gibberish.Yes, let's further desensitize ourselves to brutal violence by laughing at the murderous rampages. Are we supposed to be moved by the poetic arcs of blood and guts flying across the screen? Who is this for?

The final 3rd of the movie was enjoyable to watch. The first hour of the film you could burn in a fire and no one would care. It's a typical Deadpool movie. Incredibly violent, gory, profane, etc.It's not that the movie needs non stop action to make it good, that's further from the truth. Too much action in a movie can be an energy drain on the viewer. What made the final 3rd of the movie enjoyable is that the plot actually went somewhere. Where the first hour of the film felt like filler; building things up at a snail's pace. In order to understand this film better I HIGHLY recommend that you watch the TV series ""Loki"" because MANY of the plot points come from the plot of that TV series. Without watching Loki I think a lot of viewers will be confused as to what is happening in the film.The credits have two special easter eggs. One shows up almost right away during the credits and the 2nd credit scene was actually genuinely funny.

342,7.0,1-Sep-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)"" is like that decent pizza place down the street-good enough to satisfy the craving but not quite the slice of heaven you were hoping for. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are basically on autopilot at this point, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Their banter is still sharp, and the chemistry is undeniable, but it feels like we've been here before. It's like they reheated the leftovers from their past roles and slapped a new label on it.The movie is a wild mix of blood, jokes, and a plot that barely holds together. It's fun as hell, don't get me wrong, but it's also kind of like riding a rollercoaster that's mostly made of old parts from other rides. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, and you might even cheer a few times, but by the end, you're not really sure if it was the ride itself or just the thrill of seeing these two back in action.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" does the job, but it's not the game-changer it thinks it is. It's like ordering the usual from your favorite takeout spot-you know exactly what you're getting, and it's just fine. Perfect for fans, but maybe not worth the hype if you're expecting something groundbreaking. Still, it's hard to complain too much when Reynolds and Jackman are having this much fun, even if the movie itself is just...ok.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

While Ryan Reynolds was a more recent addition to 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchise, he became so synonymous with the Deadpool character that I'm certain I'm not alone in believing he would be nearly impossible to recast. Instead of going the recasting route, Deadpool & Wolverine utilizes the multiverse to not only explain their joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but offer an exceptionally fun buddy comedy.The plot of Deadpool & Wolverine is somehow both convoluted and basic. The movie is essentially a buddy road trip story that's complicated by multiverse politics and red herrings. The TVA, introduced and explored through two seasons of Loki, plucks Deadpool from his timeline and tells him his universe is in trouble. Instead of working with TVA agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), Deadpool looks for help from one of the multiverse's Wolverines. Since they've both gone rogue, the TVA banishes them to The Void - the multiverse's trash heap - where they face Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin).Look, I'm not going to sit here and say Deadpool & Wolverine is a ""good"" movie. The character development is thinly drawn at best, often taking a backseat to multiverse shenanigans. There's still an emotional throughline, as Deadpool searches for a purpose that'll make him matter - all to impress Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), because he's ultimately a selfish character. The new Wolverine has a barely touched tragic backstory to justify his anger issues. Everyone else in the Deadpool & Wolverine cast is a largely one-dimensional character, existing simply to serve the plot or get a cheer from the crowd.But that's not why you go to see Deadpool & Wolverine - and it's certainly not why I enjoyed the movie. Deadpool & Wolverine is a love letter to Marvel movies of the last 30 years, and I love those movies. I grew up watching the X-Men movies, and had to sit through the franchise fizzling out while enduring the false starts of The Fantastic Four. Deadpool & Wolverine gave me closure. The film is the ultimate fan service movie, couched in an odd-couple team-up. It's Fox's version of Avengers: Endgame, rendered through the playful and crude lens of Deadpool.Deadpool & Wolverine is best enjoyed by someone with a deep, enduring love for Marvel movies; as a result, the film sometimes leaves casual fans in the dust. The last three decades hold a lot of Marvel movie lore, and even those who have seen every movie referenced by Deadpool & Wolverine may be confused by some of the real-world callbacks. Thankfully,the movie strikes a good balance between very deep cuts and more general pop culture references. Still, this is very much the kind of movie where it's better to do your homework if you want to appreciate everything.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
345,9.0,25-Jul-24,"Hard belly laughs, excessively gory high-octane action, and a grounded heart to round it off nicely. This film has it all, and gives you everything it has promised from day one (and WAY more.)Ryan Reynolds is back as everyone's favourite anti-hero, and this time he's busting the back doors of the MCU wide-open, and the MCU isn't holding back. (If that isn't enough, they've opened up wider to make room for Wolverine.)Hugh Jackman brings Wolverine back to the silver screen in true Hugh Jackman style - flawless, and together with Reynolds the combination of Deadpool and Wolverine couldn't be sweeter (or saltier, whatever you prefer. I like a mix)It has to be experienced in theatres. Much like Spider-Man: No Way Home, this instant MCU favourite will have like-minded fans cheering and whooping for joy. It has all the wicked wit and tongue-in-cheek (sometimes literal - looking at you Dogpool) humour of the first two films, but with an undeniable MCU glow up that is perfectly poked at with impeccable taste.Minor flaws, the film starts fast and keeps up the pace nicely until about the 3/4 mark. The plot isn't quite as air-tight as I'd have liked, but that isn't to say that it's weak, just not without its flaws.Despite this, prepare to laugh, cry, laugh some more, choke on some popcorn, cough it back up, act like nothing happened, and then laugh some more again. This film is about to invasively fondle your mind in a way that you'll never forget. So grab your filthy novelty popcorn buckets and march into those theatre doors with your head held high. This is your time to shine.⭐⭐⭐⭐","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

347,1.0,25-Jul-24,"This was a blast, I was expecting it to be fun, Deadpool back In 2016 was a nice Surprise, it was funny and had great writing. The newest Installment is exactly the same, but funner in more ways then one. The cinema was great especially for a midnight screening, plenty of laughs in the Cinema. So it's time to review, the ultimate, the Marvel Jesus, oh wait no it's just ""Deadpool + Wolverine"".Very fun start, it felt cinematic and had Brisc pacing and at break neck pace, quite literally. The first action sequence for that reason is very well done, it had plenty of laughs. The ""206 Bones"" in the body and then they made a joke about ""Gossip Girl being 207"" that was a creative joke and quite a clever one too. Deadpool is probably at his best, he's more brutal which is a good and bad thing, and he's also more funnier. And Ryan Reynolds puts in an outstanding performance. Very heart-felt and touching at times, but most importantly entertaining and funny.Wolverine was a great character to bring back, lots of fan service moments, and they worked well because it showed his emotional side and why he had given up everything, and Not only that but it was a top-notch Performance by Hugh Jackman. Possibly the stand Out, but both Ryan and Hugh Put in an excellent performance. I thought there chemistry did lack at times, but overall they were fun together, and I felt it was the right move from Marvel to pare these two up as they do have some great moments together and between them.Cassandra Nova was the Villain, we got some cameos from Marvel characters, Blade being the biggest serprise out of them all, I won't say any more on that because I don't want to spoil it too much. Cassandra was very powerful and could brake anything quite easily, she like goes into your soul and it shares some good and bad moments in your life, particularly moving when she did it to Logan.The chemistry was perfect between Hugh and Ryan, But I did feel as though his character was too jokey at times, and also the film was fairly gory, and too gory. Aside from that this film was very enjoyable and Entertaining. I'd certainly give it a re-Watch. And I like the team-work between Deadpool and Logan, they both worked together which was interesting to see. So the big question is...,Would I recommend this Film?,Yes absolutely, I think it balances humour, Entertainment, clever witty dialogue with some fun scenes very very well. Top-performances, Stella cast jam-packed with Bloody Fun Moments, quite Literally. I did ask most on there opinion on the Movie, Some had hoped for more, others really enjoyed it. So I am glad most of them enjoyed it. Just don't have overly High expectations like others, and you won't be disappointed. 8.5 out of 10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Because by writing AND producing this movie, he really saved not just his own franchise, he saved the ENTIRE MCU.

Deadpool & Wolverine isn't the height of the MCU, but it is the height of the MCU right now, and for a franchise that's struggling at the moment, it's the shot in the arm that the MCU needs. With the whole super-racket on the ropes, the cast of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" seizes the opportunity to prove the power of their own charisma.

(aside from Guardians 3) the dialogue, the jokes, the cameo's, the surprises, the fights, everything was done so well.

This is a better example of that, but let's get to the film.The first act starts off very well, with an excellent action scene, showing everyone who was afraid of possible interference from Disney, we had an adult movie at Marvel. And was it a well-made movie? It depends.The film doesn't care about keeping the plot cohesive, neither between itself nor between the universe, and is that important? Not so much. For Marvel fans and even those who have seen any superhero movie, there will be a shower of references in the film, here there are many characters from many old movies that simply They appear all the time in the second act. And you realize that I'm already talking about the second act and I didn't talk about the plot, because there isn't one. It's just an excuse for him to save the universe and the film is based on that.And unfortunately I don't have much more to say, there is no plot, the village plays the role of driving the story but the villain changes in the middle of the film and that's it, many box office success characters and no plot. 7/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A script some 12 year old fan boy would make like it's some kinda random bromance between his favorite characters but completely butchering the characters.

However this film was full of random events that were forcefully pushed together. It lacked flow and I feel a massive opportunity was missed here by coupling up the most rugged character in the universe with the craziest. The humour was passable and worked now and then but it definitely wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be, given the two leads and how crazy they could have made the villain or antagonist. The villain did not even look formidable and just someone in a suit. This was another missed opportunity to have someone who could have been as formidable and hilarious as the two leads. This film would have benefited so much by borrowing the elements from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1 that made it so funny, logical and fun to follow at the same time.I just could not get into the this film and while people are raving about it, I honestly felt it was quite a weak mess of a film with no proper story, it was full of random and uninspired scenes and did not make as big a splash for me. This is a cash cow for Disney and Marvel but the quality of writing, great humour and nice story to weave it together was lacking.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

But today, I sat down and enjoyed a nice gem for the big screen. Fun from the start to finish, you have such a great cast of actors, and there is a big cast of them, so it was important that the script was not only funny, but had meaning, a good place for it to go, and characters that are believable. Motives aside, even the villains, have genuine bite and some caring to them, well, one does.If you like the first two films, you already know that you are going to see this, and this is great a late night cinema stay, just know that this has lots and lots of blood, and bad language, other than that, it's solid as they come.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Ever since Disney acquired Fox, I think it's safe to say nothing has been done with its hero properties, and Disney/Marvel has been hurting.So does Deadpool have what it takes to reinvigorate some much needed life back into the MCU? Well, let's be honest regardless of how well this film does in theaters. Disney/Marvel needs more than one movie to come back to life.With that being said, Deadpool & Wolverine is perhaps the summer hero blockbuster the MCU needs right now.Is this the best film in the MCU? I would say no, but it's definitely better than recent Marvel projects. Deadpool & Wolverine is simply put a fun time at the theaters it gives us more of the merc with the mouth and lots of blood and action. Then stack that with Hugh Jackman in his return to Wolverine, but also put on top of that cameos galore featuring some great Marvel characters of yesteryear and this very easily can be seen as an instant fan favorite.Unfortunately, that's all this film has to offer. It's like they said let's make a movie based on nothing more than fan service. Not to say, fan service is bad, but a movie should have more than just fanfare. The story is shockingly shallow, and ultimately, I found it boring. The villain or ""villains"" were also boring. Then the charm of all this fan service wore thin surprisingly quick. When around every corner is supposed to be fanfare for the sake of fanfare, then those moments lose impact and magic.This whole movie felt like I was touring a ""museum"" (and yes pun intended) of Marvel characters past and present. In the end, though, it was like having a super annoying fan sitting next to you saying ""hey you remember that character... hey, you remember this character?"" All I wanted to say was yes. I remember these characters. Can we do something else now.As much fun as it is to see these characters on screen again, I'd rather visit their respective films than have them being used for what amounts to commodities for ticket sales.While Deadpool & Wolverine isn't bad, it could have been so much better, but hopefully, this will be a turning point for Disney/Marvel, and the MCU would have breathed in some new life.

I paid for the ticket.The movie to be fair is fun in very small doses and if it came out before the glorious avengers timeline and before Logan became a wonderful end, I would be probably change my tune to sum it up as fun but it's as bad as the last Thor.If I was given bags of cash to come back I too would have so I can't blame any of the actors - it's a job I get it.I just wish Disney / Marvel would hit the reset switch, take time off, and come back strong but that's not how business works unfortunately.Well done for a fun movie in its own right but fingers crossed that this is the last one to come out and ruin the wonderful history of movies. It felt unnecessary.If you go in with the idea of just watching a fun movie with no connection to anything else then you'll have some fun but if you felt any connection to the previous movies or characters you might have a feeling of being ripped off by someone who knows how to make money and make money Disney will.To sum up how bad I thought it was, my review started out as 4 stars and with a bit of time and thought it went down to the now more accurate 2 stars.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool is what he always has been and has not been altered in any way but Wolverine kind of bounces Deadpool back with some colourful language too and it's like sometimes, their arguments are like a long tennis fight, and I think it was absolutely hilarious.While it's hard to talk about the film without going into spoiler territory, trust me DO NOT GET THIS FILM SPOILED. There's really surprising character comebacks and it's crazy to actually witness on the big screen where you should definitely watch it.Overall Deadpool And Wolverine has the same qualities as the original 2, but with it's horrific but funny gore and explicit jokes comes with more heart and enjoyment with battles and quotable dialogue that really could change the tide of the MCU, this film really is the best of the year so far and makes a mark on Deadpool and the MCU as one of the most fun films I have ever seen, Well done guys!Grade: A+25th July 2024 Showcase Cinema Deluxe Southampton.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The jokes, the fight sequences, the jokes...are just non-stop and if you walk out of the credits and miss the usual MCU after the credits...you lost. The whole multiverse concept has not gone over as well as the Infinity Stone story line, but Deadpool may have saved it. The fact they were able to bring back Wolverine and NOT mess with Logan...simply genius. The references to 20th Century Fox, references to old X-Men movies, old Super hero movies is just done so well....and Ryan able to get his wife in this movie, was a really nice Easter Egg. I rated this 9 of 10, but I honestly don't know why I didn't give a 10. I supposed that's serious films, I dunno.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
377,1.0,26-Jul-24,"Do you believe that movies should show respect to its characters, and make you FEEL? This movie does just that! It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It works not just on its own but as a whole sendoff and farewell message to the whole of Fox's marvel properties. The comedy is something that is nailed in this film. The journey of Deadpool and Wolverine is something to behold. The intro comes out like a hammer and believe me when I say that it is the greatest way to start the movie. I loved every second of this. My only criticism could be some of the fight choreography was a bit hard to comprehend when it involved large numbers of characters. But this movie has something that will resonate with all, instead of a lifeless movie that belittles characters the audience loves, this movie has SOUL and UPLIFTS its characters. It is cinematic history in the making! Go give this a watch!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
378,1.0,3-Aug-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a spectacular showcase of Marvel's ability to seamlessly integrate Fox characters into the Marvel Universe. Serving as a nostalgic farewell to the Fox era, the film is packed with clever references that will delight longtime fans.While the dynamic duo of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman undeniably steal the show with their impeccable chemistry and hilarious banter, the film's plot unfortunately falls flat.Despite lacking depth, the movie compensates with its over-the-top action sequences, stunning visuals, and non-stop humor. The jaw-dropping fight scenes are a highlight, and the witty dialogue had me laughing out loud.Ultimately, Deadpool and Wolverine is an entertaining action-comedy that's more style than substance. Reynolds and Jackman's performances are electric, and their on-screen partnership is pure magic. I eagerly anticipate seeing them share the screen again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The comedy is on par and sometimes better than its predecessors, the action sequences are easily some of the most satisfying fight scenes in the MCU and the dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine was amazing. The cameos were also really surprising and relevant to the overall story (one in particular completely made me lose my mind). The villain was solid and entertaining enough to move the story along. However, one of my main problems was the pacing. It feels like they were able to put a 3 act movie into the first 75 minutes and then all of a sudden there's still 45 minutes left. The story after was still great but it just felt a bit off. Plus they didn't really cover the whole Deadpool Corp thing enough for me to understand and care about the conflict. It was still very funny but the narrative side was a bit confusing. Other than those small issues, this is easily one of the best things Marvel has released in a WHILE.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Wolverine finally gets to use his correct costume, the one we all love from the comic books and cartoons. This movie is plenty of fun, with Ryan Reynolds constantly breaking the fourth wall and just being himself. The multiverse is the perfect plot device to bring back dead characters and explore dead movie franchises which this movie does beautifully. I am glad the Hugh Jackman is back. I recommend seeing this in 3-D as not many movies are made this way anymore.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I am surprised by the rating.. what has happened to fellow humans, have they completely lost it. Feels like non-sense and stupid is in trend nowadays. Really really disappointed with Marvel.

The fight scenes are excellent done, and most of all the music choice is unreal. It somehow fits Deadpool's style and also provides a good fight. I know some people dont like the humor of Deadpools movies, but i find it hilarious.

The Marvel movies thrive on their core characters... you're always happy to see them... it's the same with Wolverine... no one embodies him as well as Hugh Jackman... He and Deadpool are truly Disney's saviors.. As I said, the movie was great fun although I wasn't hoping for too much at first... an even 10 out of 10.

They brought back elements and long forgotten characters from over the years while someone tying up a lot of loose knots. While there were a few ""wtf"" CGI moments, (namely Logan once he puts his mask on,) but otherwise it was truly perfect. It wasn't at all watered down as many of us fears when comparing to the previous 2 installments in the trilogy, and even made sure to be VERY self aware while never taking itself too seriously. Sadly no, this DOES NOT MEAN Marvel is ""saved."" We all know their next movie will be right back to the garbage they've been doing since End Game, (Spider-Man excluded.) The SMART move would be to allow this to be the final film they make for a while and then start with a fresh reboot. Buuuuut we all know that won't happen.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The soundtrack is AMAZING, and I've been listening to Like a Prayer on loop since I left the theater after seeing it the first time (I've seen it twice in theaters already). Ryan Reynolds is amazing as Deadpool (as always), and Hugh Jackman is equally great as Wolverine. Their on-screen chemistry is perfect, even - or especially - during the tense moments. I was pretty surprised that I liked this movie as much as I did, especially considering it was a three-quel. It's definitely a must see!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
388,1.0,11-Aug-24,"Not all good movies are enjoyable, and not all enjoyable movies are good. This one is solidly in the latter category. If you like Ryan Reynolds' humor style, especially that of the prior Deadpool films, it's almost a lock that you'll laugh at and enjoy this as well because, well, it's more of the same.The action is also quite good. Some of the sequences can overstay their welcome at times, but they're always at least initially visually interesting. They just needed to be about 20% shorter, I think.There's a strong visual spectacle to the whole thing that is also quite good...probably better than the previous Deadpools.The acting was decent. I think Jackman in particular gets to go places I'm glad he went with this character. The moments are brief, but they're good. Reynolds...not so much. Cassandra Nova's actress did quite well I thought. Chris Evans is delightful in his cameo. But most of the rest were highly forgettable.But let's talk about the bad. The Plot. There isn't one. Okay, that's not entirely fair. There is a plot. It's just TERRIBLE. It's little more than a light justification for stringing together random cameo sequences and Reynolds' comedy bits. The movie feels almost like a sketch comedy show but with two recurring characters in each sketch, like a Python movie.Both villains' entire plans are undone by the fact that both of them are extremely stupid for no reason...multiple times. Each time Logan and Wade get the better of them, you WILL see it coming in the same way that a train blasting it's horn at you is hard to miss.Logan's character arc makes good sense, and resonates, but Reynolds' kind of doesn't. It is invented for this movie. To some extent that might be inevitable in the third installment of a trilogy.And while the fan service/homages/references/cameos are often done well and in a comforting way (the movie would have been insufferable had they been done poorly), they are nonetheless empty calories.And of course, plot holes. There are so many plot points that feel arbitrary and nonsensical. Characters doing things for the purpose of advancing the plot. Technologies or magic system points that come out of nowhere to justify things. I don't think it's a spoiler to name the most egregious one: The 'Anchor Being' concept is so profoundly idiotic and inconsistent that I actively encourage you not to think about it lest you lose 5-7 IQ points from psychic damage. As I did. And believe me, it's FAR from the only one.But at the end of the day, the question is: Did I have a good time? I did. As stupid as this movie was, Reynolds is funny and charming. The action is fun. There are a few parts of the movie that just DRAG, but I had a good time. And isn't that the point?","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It is almost like Marvel never give up on their superheroes. It is all about leaving a legacy.I can't say much without spoilers but some of the cameos were a lovely gesture to some long lost superheroes.Three cameos particularly stands out. One where most of the audience guesses the character wrongly. Then the one with the glasses (you'll understand when you watch it) and last but not the least, the one from .. oh I can't reveal that.But it's a beautiful way to poke all the DC fans out there (me included).And now to Wolverine,So nice to see Hugh Jackman reprising his role without feeling any pressure on him.

If it were any smarter, it'd write a book, a book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you.

They literally brought back characters that were trapped in the back of the closet of my childhood memories. It has the right kind of edgy rated R comedy you would expect from Ryan Reynolds, and perhaps one of the best action sequences with the perfect amount of gore you would expect from a Deadpool movie. And of course nobody did this movie more justice than the return of Hugh Jackman to the Marvel/X-Men universe. He truly returned to the big screen with a loud echoing bang. Both he and Ryan Ronalds have such a chemistry together that made this movie one of my favorites. Wolverine with his serious attitude and Deadpool with his nonsensical humor. Truly opposites attract. This movie is definitely the best Deadpool movie of all time and is definitely one of the best Marvel movies of all time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
396,2.0,13-Aug-24,"FILM: 8.5 Deadpool & Wolverine is an unexpected treat, especially for someone like me who thought Hugh Jackman had permanently hung up his claws after Logan. I remember thinking that it would take a miracle to get him back as Wolverine, but leave it to newly crowned Marvel Jesus Ryan Reynolds and the sheer force of his passion for Deadpool to make it happen. Watching these two together on screen is pure joy; their bromance is undeniable, and it translates so well into their performances.This film proves once again that when the right people are behind a project, comic book movies can still feel fresh and exciting. Reynolds' relentless passion for Deadpool, which willed the character into existence back in 2016, now brings Wolverine back into the fold. The film doesn't shy away from what made Deadpool such a hit-despite joining the MCU, the character isn't watered down. In fact, the film takes every opportunity to mercilessly skewer Disney, Marvel, and even a few rival studios. The violence and profanity are as brutal as ever, which is honestly a relief; it stays true to what fans love.As a fan, I also appreciate the cavalcade of cameos. It seems like every other film these days is crammed with nostalgic appearances, but this one actually makes those characters earn their place in the story. It's fun without feeling forced, which is a rare feat.If there's one weak spot, it's the villain, who doesn't quite live up to the standard set by the rest of the film. But then again, that's something I've come to expect from Marvel, so it didn't really dampen my overall enjoyment.All in all, Deadpool & Wolverine is a blast from start to finish. It's a movie made by people who clearly love these characters as much as the fans do, and it's loads of fun to watch. If you're a fan of either character, this is one you won't want to miss.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10.0 4K theatrical presentation Detail level: Excellent Colour reproduction: Excellent Level accuracy: Excellent Encode: Excellent Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10.0 Dolby Atmos theatrical audio Dialogue reproduction: Excellent Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent Dynamics: Excellent Surround sound presentation: Excellent LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 8.0.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Jokes were 10/10 and I'm lucky to be in the demographic that was able to get 99% of them.However, what thwarts it from receiving a 10/10 is a few things.Yes, it's a 10/10 comedy sketch, but not a film.There were a few scenes/jokes that did go on for longer than necessary. This is especially more noticeable in a second viewing; which I did just to be sure I was on it the first time. I don't know if that's on the director or editor and it doesn't ruin the movie, though it does take away from it some.There is no real story beats beyond that the characters need to get back and save the day. Commonplace, but here, for the majority of the film we are simply cast adrift while the pacing stops and we wait for something important to happen. It's oddly stagnant, but not easily noticed by most I think because they were too busy laughing to be paying attention. I was laughing too, but I was also trying to get invested in the plot.In an effort to avoid spoilers I'll simply say that Deadpool's motivation here is delivered weaker in this movie than all the rest. One thing I adored in Deadpool 2 was its combination of humor and emotion. There are no heartstrings being pulled here. And weirdly enough, I think that the creators were going for it in this film but it didn't translate well through the screen, which is disappointing.8/10 I love this movie but it does have room to improve.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
400,1.0,25-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is the perfect example of a fan-service film. It works in the way that it's very character-centric , with both Deadpool and Wolverine being well rounded characters with several movies under their belt at this point. Ironically , Wolverine is a little more one dimensional this time around (considering we see several versions of him - not including the older films) but he's still the Wolverine we know and love with also some of the same internal struggles we've known him to have every time we see him. It's just in a slightly different context this time. It works though , and the pairing of these two characters , both perfectly suited for an R-rated environment showcasing tons of action and self-referential commentary , while also featuring cameos from fan favorite marvel characters both new and old. The problems start with the villain , which ties into issues that Marvel films have been having for a while now. There's no avoiding it at this point. Though the meta nature of Deadpool can help you shrug off things here and there , there is no avoiding not just the extremely vague/shallow motivations of the antagonist , but the same tropes that Marvel has implemented as part of their formula that they've been using for over half a decade now. There's plot holes and MacGuffins galore , and no matter how many times you point that out and try to make us laugh about it, (and therefore hopefully shrug it off) it just doesn't work like that. If your movie has off kilter pacing and plot points that make you start questioning things to a point where you are taken out of the experience, said experience is inevitably diminished. In this day and age , Marvel just makes too many excuses to get from Point A to Point B that it can't be ignored. No amount of cameos and references is going to hide that fact , especially for people that genuinely care about the art of film. I say this because if you're just a Marvel fan that wants to see some of your favorite heroes, and more importantly Deadpool and Wolverine on the big screen both as a team and against each other, (arguably one of the best scenes in the movie is a fight scene that takes place solely inside a Honda Odyssey) you'll probably be pleased. However , as someone who was obsessed with the MCU all the way up until Endgame , they started losing me once it was obvious they had no real plan. I don't blame them. You want to keep the machine going. It's just that it this point it doesn't matter what you put on screen and how much you make me laugh; if that same tired formula is still clearly being used - those same heights can never be reached again until the whole foundation is re-worked top to bottom. All that being said, It's still a perfectly enjoyable movie that will make plenty of people happy - happy in the same way No Way Home made people happy. It's just that you can't help but worry about where things even go from here and how they could possibly keep the lightning striking. Something will have to change.... Maybe I'm just not into Marvel like I used to be.SEE IT FOR DEADPOOL&WOLVERINE (and a certain man in sunglasses) but nothing else. Cheers.-Tate.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

There's no gore, no witty banter-none of the things that made the first movies so fun and refreshing.

It does a great job as a dead pool movie in the sense that it gives you what you want however the only pressing con I found was that it seemed very clostrophobic in a way. The scenes, the story, even though part of it takes place in infinite void from time and universes, there was still something that made it feel like the every scene was in box and not in a world. Could it be a common things with budgets and special effects in movies now days that is creating it or is there something else such as cinematography lens choices for certain scenes? To be honest I'm not quite sure what it is exactly that gave me such an impression but it leaves me wanting to see it again in order to find out and to see if there was other things I may have missed.Over all still a great comedy with good action and of course big nods to the comics and creators that inspired it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Scratch that! This one starts off a bit in the future and one needs to pay a little attention to keep track.The humour is great and makes the whole 2 hour journey of this movie worth it. The movie keeps with its Deadpool trend which is tongue in cheek humour and it is well timed and helps one really get a good load off oneself. Laughter is indeed the best medicine.The killings are still gruesome so I would suggest avoid any kind of ketchup in your food as it makes an unnecessary correlation. I kind of wish Deadpool wasn't so gruesome but hey it's DEADpool the name says it all.The movie promises a future continuance of this partnership and I for one would love to see this Wolverine and Deadpool bromance take over from the Avengers.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Everything from the cameos, comedy, action, & cinematography that recent Marvel films have been disgustingly FORCING & LACKING have been made up with this film.Every fight scene in this movie is miles beyond any fight scene that was in that absolute disgrace & overrated embarrassment of a movie that is called Endgame. Still don't understand the praise over that film.Hugh Jackman & Ryan Reynolds's acting was fantastic per usual, there was never a dry or dull moment through the entire movie, these 2 make a great combo.

408,9.0,2-Oct-24,"I'm not the biggest fan of Deadpool, however, I greatly enjoyed the first movie, and I even made peace with the second, which is acceptable and has several strong points. But this third one is nothing more than another wet dream of Reynolds, and not one of the properly conceived ones.It doesn't surprise me that there were so many writers involved, as the quantity only served to dilute the quality.Obviously, as a writer, I'm mainly referring to the story's plot structure, character development, their depth, and everything that makes a good story enjoyable and memorable. Yet, all of that was lost in a sea of cameos devoid of emotional depth for the main story, and even a nonsensical barrage of verbiage from all the characters, each with less comedic weight than the last, until it became tiresome.In other words, they relied on nostalgia as the primary driver of this movie and even tried to ride the coattails of Logan's success to exploit it; however, the lack of connection and emotion caused them to desecrate one of the best movies, and one of the best endings, in this category, all to satisfy the spontaneous ideas of a character who should take some time to think things through better.It's not that I have a problem with bringing Wolverine back, but not like this. Much less under the stupid premise that Vanessa and Wade broke up due to Deadpool's frustration over not being able to do something meaningful with his life, even though there wasn't the slightest hint of those thoughts in the previous movie. In fact, it doesn't even fit with Deadpool's ideology.Honestly, I couldn't believe that after all that odyssey, their relationship would break so easily, and even less so, that it would be mended just as easily-and without the slightest involvement of all those -supposed- friends of Deadpool.Moreover, I'm not even going to get started on the dramatic holes in the timelines, let alone the cliché appearance of a villain pulled from nowhere, the unification of worlds that don't even make sense together, or the barrage of theatrical scenes that completely disrupt the story's flow.It's clear that the writers were aware of the lack of narrative depth involved in bringing up the multiverse and time travel (themes that played a detrimental role in the MCU) as a method to revive characters and continue profiting off them. However, they didn't care and did it anyway.In any case, it's just my opinion, and as far as I'm concerned, I'm going to watch Logan once more to get rid of such a frustrating narrative structure, and then wait until Ryan Reynolds invents another character to make fun of this terrible event. But if the fans continue to prioritize nostalgia so much, then I suppose this will be our cinematic future, just like what happened with Star Wars.That said, I greatly enjoyed the choreography between Wolverine and Deadpool, the nostalgic appearance of some characters (even though they made no sense), and even seeing some actors I hadn't seen in a long time. In that sense, it felt like this movie was more of a personal project by the fans to pay tribute to those heroes, and therefore, a nice reminder of those times, which would explain the additional scenes at the end of the movie, and even the music from my childhood. However, as a writer, it was inevitable for me to hate the premise, the plot, and the overall character development, since the new ends up desecrating the old, just as Deadpool exemplified with Wolverine's lifeless body; which seems to be Disney's new strategy with all the remakes they have cooking.""We were so preoccupied with whether we could, that we didn't stop to think if we should.""In the end, when we understand that in the digital world our voices can last for centuries, it forces us to realize that we must refine the footprints we will leave behind. And therefore, following my own advice, only the best of my literary work will endure in this small vault: ...","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
409,8.0,14-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is the only Marvel film to come out this year, so it needed to deliver, and boy it did! Were we ever really in doubt though when we heard that it was going to keep its R rating.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman absolutely kill it and have such great chemistry together, from the jokes/comedy and the fight scenes, to the heartfelt moments.This movie is a barrel of fun with plenty of references and pokes and nods to Disney and Fox in the jokes. Deadpool breaking the fourth wall never gets old. There are plenty of great cameos to take you by surprise, and the villain, Cassandra Nova, isn't a top tier villain but she still does an excellent job in the role.It is easy to follow and is fairly easy to understand what is going on in case the inclusion of the TVA had you concerned it would be confusing.The music soundtrack is perfect with little references, but that opening sequence was so good. I have that song on repeat it's so good.Hats off to Shawn Levy, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, because their work absolutely paid off big time and this film deserves all the success as I cannot see a better way to have done this film it is the perfect send off to Fox. My favourite Deadpool film, but a tough decision between Logan and this one for my favourite ""X-Men/Fox"" film.If you have not seen it yet, go and see it now while it is still in theaters, as it a surreal experience and watching it on Disney+ doesn't feel the same as the theater experience.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
410,8.0,25-Jul-24,"Oh how I was looking forward to this... Yeah, like everybody else, I know. I'm certainly not alone in my love for X-Men, although, in all honesty, I haven't kept up enough to know all the details. And so, there were more than enough moments and references throughout which left me clawing my own brain (much like a certain character in the movie) looking for the right information to go with what I was seeing to explain the overwhelming mayhem that was going on. Unfortunately, for the most part, I was left feeling exactly like that: overwhelmed and pummelled by the nonsensical mayhem.Please understand: I freaking love Deadpool!! And I love Wolverine even more, I really do. You have no idea how high my anticipation was for this collaboration that's basically been 24 years in the making. 'Logan' (2017) was a truly beautiful piece of cinema, deeply moving and virtually flawless. It was a truly fitting ending to one of the best fictional characters in modern cinema. I remember going into 'Deadpool & Wolverine' extremely excited, and then, as the introductory scene started rolling out, suddenly I thought to myself, ""Oh God, I hope they don't ruin it."" I was overcome by a sudden sense of dread that somehow, Wolverine's resurrection in this movie would somehow completely demolish the feeling left behind by 'Logan'. And I hate to say it, but... I wasn't entirely wrong. Certainly, this is Deadpool and you know going in that absolutely *nothing* is sacred, but still... Was it worth it? Was it at least funny? The answer is yes... and no.The absolute worst thing has happened: I didn't love 'Deadpool & Wolverine'. I didn't hate it either. It left me feeling ambivalent. Who the hell wants to feel ambivalent about the greatest X-Men pairing of all time??The first act was great. It gave me great hopes for the second and third acts, and then, suddenly, that feeling vanished. The start of the second act is awesome, no doubt about it. D&W are hurled into what's essentially the garbage bin of the universe, and this is where all the fabled cameos start rolling in. And then, inexplicably, there's a shift in tone. The first familiar X-Men face to turn up made me super happy, and then it was over before you could even blink and I felt a devastating disappointment. I was so looking forward to this particular reunion/confrontation and it ended so abruptly that I felt robbed. I felt the shift happen with the rest of the audience as well, it was palpable. From this moment on, so much happens all at once and we're thrown into a setting that's so reminiscent of ""Deadpool and Wolverine beyond Thunderdome"", (including actual jokes about Mad Max) that somehow, it passes the point of parody and turns into on-the-nose cliché. It all feels too familiar, and at the same time, so strange and confusing, I was just constantly stuck in a feeling of ""what the hell is going on""?! Who are all these characters? What are they doing here? Why did Feige et al pull open such a random can of X-Men villains without giving any of them any worthy screen time? How are we even supposed to understand everything that's happening when all we are given to go on is an overload of references and puzzle pieces that we apparently have to put together ourselves? Do they expect every single audience member to possess an encyclopaedic knowledge of the entire MCU? Jason Flemyng and Kelly Hu are back as Azazel and Lady Deathstrike respectively and are given so little screentime and not even a single line of dialogue, it really makes you wonder if they prioritised quantity over quality this time. The answer to me is clearly, yes. It feels as if they spent 15 minutes working on the actual story for this film, and the rest of the time they had on gathering as many Marvel characters (and nearly all their original actors!) as possible to pummel the audience into their own kind of Void, where we might actually be fooled into thinking that an overkill of quantity actually equates quality.The rest of the audience clearly felt the same way I did. From the start of the second act, for at least about half an hour or so, it was awkwardly quiet in the theatre. Nobody laughed and all the jokes fell completely flat. It wasn't until the third act that things started looking up again. Maybe it has all become too familiar. The first Deadpool movie was incredible, because it was something that had never actually been done before, style wise. The tone was so original and refreshing, and the ironic nature of the humour was such an original concept that it all worked surprisingly well. Then they did it a second time and even though it was a little less brilliant, it was still great. This time, it's just... yeah I've seen this before. Oh ha-ha, ironic joke. A dozen ironic songs. Breaking the fourth wall so much it's been destroyed completely. Subtlety was never Deadpool's strong suit, but this is overkill, even for him.God, I feel like a right sourpuss right now. Was it all bad? No!! Absolutely not! In fact, there was a lot that was hysterically funny, really well done and OH MY GOD WOLVERINE IN HIS ORIGINAL COSTUME IS THE COOLEST THING EVER AND SOOOOO WORTH THE WAIT!! There will truly never be another Wolverine like Hugh Jackman, and I for one am so thankful that he came back to do this one more time! For this reason alone, this movie is well worth the price of an admission ticket. And yes, some of the cameos are truly awesome - there are a few who were seriously unexpected surprises - and are a joy to watch. But still... I can't shake the feeling that it could have been done very differently. There was just too much of everything, but (and here's the true irony of Deadpool 3) by and large the best scenes were those where Poolboy and Wolfie were alone together. That's where the magic was; they didn't need anyone else. The story was downright idiotic and the main villain was annoying and uninteresting AF, and the few cameos I was truly looking forward to were all so short they barely added anything of value, with a couple of exceptions. And the thing that puzzles me the most is the staggering absence of Vanessa. They already ticked me off by virtually erasing her from DP2, and now she has even less screen time. I don't get it. Not only is her presence Wade's most important driving force, but the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Morena Baccarin is so awesome, that I am simply dumbfounded as to why they wouldn't use her more. Oh man, I could go on forever... There is so much that I loved, and so much else that frustrated and confused me.Is it worth it? Yes.Is it all I hoped it would be? No.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The cast is incredible as always and Hugh Jackman addition was lovely to say the least.Villain was incredible whilst not being the primary objective which I find refreshing.

Would've loved to see more character development in a few of the characters but other than that I enjoyed the movie. The references made about the MCU and movie studios was priceless.

It's tedious with barely a thread of a plot.I wish I'd timed how often Deadpool and Wolverine fight each other - I reckon that must have covered around 30 minutes of running time. In fact, most of the movie is just mindless fight scenes; perhaps that's to disguise the lack of plot.It's not really a movie but an excuse for 183 minutes of Ryan Reynolds trying to show off how witty his dialogue can be.The director must get a particular joy watching people get skewered in the nuts, as it occurs around 20 times through the movie. It just gets boring after the first 2 or 3 times.I actually wanted to walk out half-way through the movie, but persisted and wasted an extra hour of my life.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The new faces were 100% top shelf too!I tapped out after Endgame apart from the big screen offerings of Dr Strange 2, Black Widow, & The Marvels. Would like to have kept up with Loki's timeline shenanigans on the Disney channel but I'm afraid of going down the Disney/MCU/Star Wars rabbit hole. My experience with Back To The Future, Terminator, Timecop (yes, you heard right) did suffice in helping to understand this movie's time alteration hijinks.Most people will have fun with it.[Edit: the closing credits montage of the early X-Men films was a fine reminder of how so very many of us have aged alongside Hugh's take on Logan - The Wolverine]","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A true feast of Easter Eggs, both for movie and comic book fans, and a killer soundtrack! The chemistry between Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool carries the whole film. The only thing holding this movie back from getting a 10 for me is that it does take a while to get started, with a fairly exposition-heavy beginning, and the overuse of a handful of swearwords makes the dialog feel a bit sloppy at times. But all in all, it's an excellent film that I cannot wait to watch again!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I loved all the jokes they made about the MCU and all the callbacks to the movies made before it. Sadly, Deadpool 3 doesn't bring much to the table itself. The plot makes no sense at all and relies too much on coincidences. There are pacing issues and at times it feels like they smashed tree different scripts together all with a different tone and intention. The story lacks focus and shies away from any clear message. While it is still a joy to watch Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in their iconic roles going at it, I can't help to wonder if this movie could have been much more.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Honestly in the last couple of years Marvel universe has been overstuffed with this concept and now getting too boring. The high ratings on IMDB is probably from younger moviegoers and not from the yore days x-men lovers. A big weakness of this film is the absence of any major showdown with the adversary.

The story line is non-existent. There is really only so many times I can see someone get stabbed in the balls and laugh.The whole multiverse concept is self defeating as well because it diminishes any stakes in the film. In a universe where there are infinite other Deadpools it doesn't matter if one of them dies.I think Stan Lee would be really disappointed in what they've done with his work.Needless to say I want my money back and I really regret being part of this films 'success' because the Disney/Marvel machine will simply pump out more of this garbage; diluting the quality of film and lowering the bar for everyone.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

426,2.0,14-Aug-24,"This one is the weakest in the Deadpool series but also has so much to enjoy. It's more like the swan song of the Fox X-Men series rather than an MCU entry.First the bad. It's pretty tame compared to the first two Deadpool movies. It may be because it's now under the official Disney-Marvel banner, or maybe it's because the Writers and Actors strikes during development. Whatever the reason, it seems like it's pulling its punches. It still has plenty of bite, but there's some obvious stuff the movie avoids going after.Already, some of the worst of the MCU is bleeding in. Mostly, that it relies too much on other works. Don't know the entire history of Marvel movies including undeveloped ones then the cameos don't feel special. Some of the stuff can go over the heads of casual fans. Didn't see Loki on Disney+? Then a lot of the second half won't make any sense. Deadpool has always used references to other Marvel work, but this is the first time it's necessary to the plot to know this stuff.Sadly, the supporting cast seems to have been tossed aside. There's the party scenes that bookend the movie, but they're entirely gone. None of the fun interactions with Colossus, Negasonic, Dopinder, etc that made the first two so much fun. There's a moment that seems like a set-up to a side story about them rescuing Wade, but nothing comes from it.The movie doesn't have the emotional core that the earlier two did. The first was a love story and the second about family. They had personal stakes. This one is about the destruction of the universe, which is big but lacks that personal touch. It also doesn't connect to the end of the second film as far as where the characters are. Too much of the in-between has to be explained when it would've been easier to just rewrite some scenes.There are two villains, but neither are interesting. Both seem to do whatever furthers the plot but not what makes sense. Neither have a plan that seems thought out, just to make the most problem at any given moment. The previous two had great conflicts, and this points to that lack of personal stakes.And finally, the Multiverse. Marvel and DC Comics have made great use of alternate realities, What Ifs, and possible futures. The movies not so much. I love seeing Patrick Stewart, Michael Keaton, and Tobey Maguire back in costume. But bringing back beloved actors, and occasionally listening to fan castings, seems to be the extent of what the movies are doing. The Deadpool Corps are also wasted. The idea of dozens of alternate Deadpools coming together should be cinematic gold. Instead they're mostly treated as cannon fodder.Now the good. The titular duo are amazing together. Reynolds and Jackman know how to bounce off each other. Both are in perfect form, showing the kind of rapport that's straight out of the comics. This is a team up that's been fifteen years in the making, and it doesn't disappoint in that regard. Though it's definitely more Wolverine's movie. It acknowledges how terrific Logan is, but gives this new Wolverine plenty of depth in what might be the best example of having its cake and eating it too.The movie does for the X-Men movies what No Way Home did for Spider-Man. It expertly includes the previous movie into the MCU while making a great case for their continuation. The X-Men and Spider-Man movies are the reason the MCU even exists so it's nice to see them treated so lovingly.Just like the original Deadpool did, the movie expertly brings the R rating to the MCU. In fact, there's more blood, swearing, and carnage than the other Deadpool movies. The only thing I know they couldn't do is hardcore drug use, and this makes for some fun scenes with Blind Al. This may be under the family friendly Disney banner, but Marvel seems to realize it's best for some franchises do their own thing.Deadpool has always had fun with Easter eggs, cameos, and references. This one more than most. The fight at the 20th Century Fox logo being a big one. It brings back a lot of characters from the franchise, and some from others like the Russian guy from the Thomas Jane Punisher movie. It may be more in-your-face than the previous two, but it's a lot of fun for the hardcore fans.This one feels like Avengers: Endgame. Too many problems to really match up to the previous entries, but too much good stuff to be bad. The MCU has been in a rough spot, but if anything this movie proves that Marvel can acknowledge that and work to fix it. Hopefully this won't be the last we see of Deadpool and Wolverine.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

However, it's highly recommended to watch 2017's *Logan* beforehand-it's crucial for understanding some key moments in the film.Overall, the movie is absolutely crazy and bloody, delivering high entertainment value from start to finish. The action sequences are intense, the humor is spot-on, and the surprises keep coming. For the best experience, find a theater with a great atmosphere and enjoy it with an enthusiastic crowd. Watching it with others who are equally excited amplifies the fun and excitement.I truly hope this film can help Marvel bounce back after some lackluster years and remind everyone why we fell in love with their movies in the first place.

It is the same reason that Deadpool & Wolverine is empty despite the barrage of jokes (three or four of which are good ones). And feels thin: because of the endless possibilities of the multiverse - through which characters can step from one reality to another - the stakes are no longer at stake. Films become a series of random scenes with some ultra-violence and adolescent humor for laughs.The collaboration between the two polar opposites is quite infectious, but Deadpool & Wolverine never really becomes a full-fledged film. There is a storyline about two British villains (Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen) who want to mess with the timelines, but any sense of plot development is undone by adolescent humor and countless cameos that add little.

If I could see oily Hugh Jackman walk out in slow motion to Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls every night before I fall asleep I would. But marvel got its hands on this movie and just ruined everything good about Deadpool. The fight scenes aren't even good. They're long as hell and they reuse the same gag of stabbing someone in the crotch like 15 times in two hours. This whole movie felt like beating a dead horse, and I cannot handle any more multiverse stuff. Marvel is so capitalistic at this point, there is no art in the movies anymore.

But hey, at least they set it up so they can make 8 more movies!!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Everything they've released in the past few years has either fallen short or completely bombed.That being said, the Deadpool franchise has been really entertaining outside of the MCU...until now. Nothing got me more hyped than knowing this would be a Deadpool AND Wolverine movie. I even decided beforehand that I would still see it even if the reviews were bad.HOLY SH!! This was the most completely awesome Marvel film I've seen in years! The jokes, the action, the cameos, the story ALL of it brought back that great thrill I once had for superhero films.I'm DEFINITELY adding this one when it comes out on video.

After 5 long years of MCU Dudds, I feel like this has brought the franchise back to life. I'm uncertain of what Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's involvement will be in the MCU after this film, but they need to become a big part of it.It's clear to see, that we have been missing some powerhouse stardom after Evans and Downey left the MCU and I believe these two majestic beings (Reynolds and Jackman) are the ones to deliver it!Bring on Deadpool 4,5 & 6.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
436,1.0,26-Jul-24,Let's be clear. If you are expecting another superheroes (recycled) story as happens lately in Marvel; you will be disappointing. But you are willing to laugh and really have fun on the messy Marvel inventions; like timelines and time guardians and multiverse prepare for the time of your life.Some comments said the story is absurd; yes it is; as most of Marve MORE SERIOUS stuff; the good thing about this one is that it make everything big fun.Of course having Hugh Jackman / Wolverine requieres some serios moments; are not that much and are very well and seriusly performed. The rest is one joke after the other and many many unexpected cameos that are also part of the joke.Mixing Avengers; the Fantastic Four and X-MEN did not look easy but Ryan Reynols and the rest of scripting team did and excellent job mixing lots of elements and characters.In brief; enjoy it for two hours you will not regret it.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It develops some characters further, it brings justice to some that might not even deserve it and brings some to life not seen before. It doesnt hold back, its unforgiving, but without being pretentious. It steers the way back for whole Marvel franchise after so many awful movies and TV shows. It brings so many fun cameos. In other words this film is exactly what it needs to be, what fans wanted and what Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deserve, and even a little bit more.

This is definitelly a hit for Disney, and a must watch for the core fans. Jackman is Jacked-man, so believable and really playing it on a high level. Deadpool is fantastic as always with some of the depth but not too much. Antagonists are a bit of a miss tbh, but they get their asses kicked big time, so all good.

Logan/Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) wants nothing to do with anyone, when he meets Deadpool. They join forces to vanquish a powerful enemy.Deadpool & Wolverine is a mind-blowing film. Director Shawn Levy has given us a movie that builds upon the best parts of the Deadpool franchise & amplifies it because the titular characters are now in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The comedy will make you guffaw uncontrollably. Don't worry though. There's definitely a heartwarming & emotional core at its center. The action set pieces are awe-inspiring. The visual effects are phenomenal. The 3D is eye-popping & becomes even more immersive in IMAX. The cameos are jaw-dropping! Ryan Reynolds is spectacular as Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Reynolds should play Deadpool forever. Hugh Jackman is outstanding as Logan/Wolverine. It's an absolute delight to see Jackman finally wear the comic book accurate Wolverine costume, after 24 years playing the iconic character. Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman share effortless camaraderie & exchange the best banter, in all their scenes together. Emma Corrin is fantastic as Cassandra Nova. Matthew Macfadyen is brilliant as Mr. Paradox. The supporting cast is excellent. Deadpool & Wolverine is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & fans of the titular characters. Watch it on the biggest screen possible & I promise you will be laughing, cheering & having the best time you could possibly have!

Some genuine emotions...Stop this lame multiverse crap and give us grounded meaningful stories with some emotional weight - Go back to Deadpool 1!It's not enough to write a bad movie and then burry it in mediocre comedy - Yes some of the jokes made me chuckle, but that's not enough! I would have probably chuckled the same amount if I spent those two hours on social media...What is this... Seriously you guys... Marvel movies have truly become a complete shell of themselves.In addition to that the villain is a cheesy joke that takes itself way too seriously in comparison to everything else. Not only does the villain look stupid, her character and motivations are as generic as it gets.Oh and the ""action"" scenes are also extremely lame... They are completely empty and simply feel like performances for the viewer, not something that happens organically or has the potential to change the outcome of the story in any way. Action scenes are best when something is at stake and when they have meaning for the actual plot - this is the type of stuff that could make us sit on the edge of our seat!

Hugh tries to deliver some good performance but can't work his way around with the idiotic script. Action choreography is horrendous as expected from a director whose sole trademark is delivering soulless corporate mediocre slop.All of the character cameos doesn't resonate with the audience at any level and plot wise it's even more idiotic.The plot or whatever passes around for one these days in Hollywood is not only paper thin but tonally inconsistent. Glad i wasted my time not money by watching a pirated copy. Trying to overdo what made the first movie leads to this hot trash. Save your money and avoid this stitched up carcass of a franchise long dead. Also the plot doesn't have any consequences for MCU so along with poor direction, you can add false advertising to the litany of accusations you can pile up on this fossil of a franchise.Tim Miller, the first movie director understood how to approach the character but too bad when the central star is given preference and free reign as if he's the who one understands plot progression better than a certified professional filmmaker.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Bringing back old characters are good fan service but if you didn't grow up with them you have no clue. If anyone gives this higher than 6 it's purely on nostalgia and not good writing or good movie quality. The use of the red characters had no effect on the movie, just seemed like an afterthought.

Not massively, but it works more than enough to get what you need out of it. My thought process going into this was ""will wolverine work? And how does he come to be with Deadpool?"" But, it's explained well and it doesn't feel too gimmicky. Like I said, it works well with the plot at hand. The comedy I thought they absolutely hit the nail on the head, worked so well with the plot and the marvel jabs really made me laugh!When it comes to it.

462,1.0,26-Jul-24,"When the film was first announced, I was a bit excited because of Hugh Jackman, but I knew the story wouldn't be that good. There is a problem with all these multiverse movies. The lack of effort in storytelling is evident in all of these movies. The phrase ""all style, no substance"" shows a lot in the multiverse movies, and it shows a lot of it here, although I wouldn't go as far as saying there is an absolute zero substance here, but you get the point.The movie is what you would expect: a high-octane action-packed movie filled with lewd jokes and jokes directed at Disney, Fox, and the MCU. Sometimes, it gets exhausting to repeatedly have a joke every minute or so, but the ones that do land are really funny. I have to admit, this movie got me cracking at times. However, for a movie that was expected to save the MCU, it didn't reach that high bar. I still hope this movie inspires the MCU to give what the people want or what most want anyway. This way, the next movie has a higher chance of being a movie that fans will love.Despite having no real plot, I liked the character arcs of Logan and Wade. For Deadpool, he learns what it means to be a hero. For Wolverine, we see a new arc since this guy's a new guy. The character arc is good, as he also learns what it means to be a hero. However, I felt that this arc had already been done before for Logan, so I felt it was kind of repetitive. Outside of the two leads, however, the other characters have little to do. The two mains really carried the movie for me. Hugh wearing the comic costume was also nice.For a movie that was meant to be the last ""Fox"" movie, I was kind of disappointed with how it dealt with the Fox movies. I know the movies are things of the past, but I felt that more respect could have been given. Again, there are some things I can only talk about in the next review, but all I will say is that I felt a bit unsatisfied. One thing that I really loved was the credits scene (not to be confused with the post-credits scene). That tugged at my heart.One thing that I absolutely hate about this movie is that most of the cameos (maybe except X-23) weren't utilized more. They were just kind of there, like in Multiverse of Madness (or Sadness as I would say). People like Sabretooth, Pyro, and the rest (who I can't talk about yet) should have had more to do. For X-23, I guess she had the talk with Jackman's alternate Wolverine, which I think is what made me say it wasn't wasted. There were several missed opportunities, which I will mention in the next review.The performances were all really good, though. I think Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine so effortlessly. After 7 years of retirement, he comes back, and it feels like he never left, and I am not saying this just because I love Wolverine. Hugh's and Ryan's interactions were really fun. Macfadyen and Corrin's performances were also good in their villain roles, despite the lack of depth each has.The visuals are alright. They're better than past post-Endgame movies. I think the scenes in the Void could have looked better because they kind of look dry sometimes. I know that's the point because Deadpool references Mad Max, but I just think maybe it could have been less plain. The soundtrack, however, was awesome. I think that every time the music plays, the scene gets instantly better. They match what the scene needs.Overall, if you're looking for a movie that moves you or has a decent story, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a movie that has good action and lewd jokes that crack you up from time to time, this is your movie.P. S.

468,1.0,29-Jul-24,"Six years after the last Deadpool movie and seven after the last film featuring Wolverine, the two titans finally come together in the third Deadpool film. To some, this may scream fanservice, but let's face it: in this franchise, that's the name of the game. The jokes are rapid fire and virtually non-stop, poking fun at everything from the state of Disney and Marvel to how much we've been waiting for this crossover to the tropes of big budget films like this, along with the requisite load of fourth wall breaks, a personal favorite type of humor. Suffice it to say, all this leads to a ton of laughs. But, the film surprisingly also has a decent story. There are actual stakes that affect people other than our heroes, and some shockingly decent emotional moments. And, the pacing is perfect, fast when it needs and slow when it needs.The return of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman to their most famous roles is more than welcome. They prove they still have it and have all the chemistry. You can just tell they had a ton of fun with this film and the chance to finally work together on a superhero film that isn't garbage. Just as thankfully, after the previous two films didn't even give us one good villain, this one gives us two in Matthew McFayden and Emma Corrin. And, the cameos are pervasive and everywhere. I won't say who appears to avoid spoilers, but they are all fantastic and even get some laughs, like when an actor appears who we think is one character but turns out to be someone else.The action scenes are the best in the series, fast paced, brutal, and giving us some huge laughs. The best are, in my opinion, the fight during the opening credits (my disappointment over how they aren't nonsensical credits like the first two was undone by the clever editing and just how awesome the action is) and the fight between the two leads in the car. The sets are stellar, including the returning TVA headquarters and the amusing lair of Corrin's character. And the soundtrack is fantastic, including some hilarious song choices during the two aforementioned action scenes.Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine may very well be the best of the Deadpool films. It actually has a story, unlike the first film, and it's better paced than the second. It really gives the audience everything we could ask for with this duo, and I couldn't be more satisfied.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
469,1.0,5-Aug-24,"Last night i watched Deadpool & Wolverine and i must say film is must watch. I watched previous two Deadpool films and other Marvel film's in its original language but my friend recommended me to watch this movie in Hindi Dub and I must say dubbing was actually very good. Hindi Dialogues perfectly match in comedic situation and audience laughing all the time in theatre.Deadpool & Wolverine is an explosive, hilarious, and action-packed ride that perfectly blends the irreverent humor of Deadpool with the brooding intensity of Wolverine. This film is a testament to the power of chemistry, as Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman share an undeniable on-screen camaraderie that elevates the entire experience.The film masterfully balances its comedic and action-packed elements. Deadpool's signature fourth-wall-breaking antics and witty one-liners are as sharp as ever, while Wolverine's raw power and berserker rage provide a thrilling counterbalance. The action sequences are choreographed with precision and are visually stunning, but it's the comedic timing and banter between the two protagonists that truly sets this film apart.While the film pays homage to the characters' comic book origins, it also manages to offer fresh perspectives on both Deadpool and Wolverine. We see a more vulnerable side to Wolverine, while Deadpool's chaotic energy is dialed up to eleven. The dynamic between the two characters is constantly evolving, keeping the audience engaged and entertained.The fight sequences in Deadpool & Wolverine are a breathtaking blend of brutal efficiency and comic book absurdity. Wolverine's feral, animalistic fighting style is juxtaposed with Deadpool's chaotic, unpredictable approach, creating a visually stunning and exhilarating spectacle. The cinematography during these sequences is nothing short of exceptional. Rapid cuts, slow-motion, and dynamic camera angles capture the intensity and chaos of the fights, immersing the audience in the action. The use of handheld cameras adds a gritty, realistic feel, while the incorporation of Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking commentary provides a unique and humorous twist.The music score for Deadpool & Wolverine is a masterclass in balancing contrasting tones. The action sequences are accompanied by a pulsating, adrenaline-fueled score that perfectly complements the on-screen mayhem. The use of heavy metal and industrial elements adds to the raw intensity of the fights. On the other hand, during the comedic moments, the score is lighthearted and playful, often incorporating unexpected musical choices that enhance the humor.The cinematography in Deadpool & Wolverine is a character in itself. The film boasts a vibrant, comic book-inspired visual style that is both visually appealing and functionally effective. The use of color is bold and striking, with the red and yellow color palette of Deadpool's costume serving as a focal point.While the film is largely a triumph, there are a few minor issues. The plot, while entertaining, is somewhat predictable at times. Additionally, some of the comedic gags might not land for everyone, as the humor is sometimes crude and irreverent.Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a must-see for fans of the characters and action-comedy genre. It's a film that delivers on all fronts, with a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
470,8.0,16-Sep-24,"If there was no ""Logan"" we could say this is great goodbye to loved character but ""Logan"" just showed to fans that it is possible to create amazing story, action and x-men cinematic experience.Right from gates when this was announced i knew it will be bad, as there is no way they will add Logan version to Deadpool, and i think that is biggest disappointment that the version of wolverine that we waited for so long was finally delivered on last movie and on kinda-reboot we again get base model.Story was meh, people say effects was good, but i do not feel effects was better than Loki tv series and when Wolverine got his mask on, it was such a bad cgi and decision to mask Jackmans face on emotional moments was crime against his acting ability.Main antogonist? Boring (good acting), powers inconsistent, her goal doesn't make sense and is inconsistent.Fight scenes was good? It had 1 good fight scene which was opening scene and that was constantly interrupted by dance or credits. Final fight scene which should be a pinnacle was literally wolverine doing same attack move all over and over again.It is fun movie if you just want to relax, but it even so it gets boring. If you come from ""Logan"" just be ready to see how they butcher Wolverine, i think Jackman was/is far better actor than Ryan and you can see glimpses in this movie how well he delivers his side of the story.Final thoughts. You dont get proper Deadpool movie (i loved 1 and 2), and you definitely dont get proper Wolverine movie. Lets be honest all the 10 and 9 ratings are just effect from both actor star power and great PR, and because fans knew it is either this or nothing because there will not be second attempt. It is like star wars, still earns a lot on box office, because fans have no other way to get more of universe they love.If you are not big fan of Logan, i can see giving this move 7-8, as it is ""decent"" summer cinema experience.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

476,4.0,6-Aug-24,My friend and I went to watch this as it was clearly the most popular movie to be released that week and had long queues which I haven't seen for a while at a cinema.What a complete waste of time! The jokes were so lame (probably laughed once during the whole movie) and the whole storyline was so stupid. Is this what people really consider entertainment now??I have learned one valuable lesson from this movie - Don't look at reviews as a guide for choosing movies! A large population of online morons clearly don't have the slightest clue what a good movie really is. It seems we are guided by nerds that have never left their bedroom or people that have never seen good quality movies and don't understand what constitutes a great script.People's standards of a good movie are now so low that it is killing off the movie industry. Why the hell are people happy with watching garbage and brainwashing others in thinking movies such as this are something special?If you value real talent and believe movies should have a high standard please don't make the mistake of falling for the high ratings on this one. It was pure garbage!,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A perfect third movie to the Deadpool series! Ryan Reynolds is absolutely brilliant at what he does behind that mask and I don't think I ever stopped laughing or smiling the entire film.I would say that they did obviously have to dive into the TVA plot line that all of the other marvel movies are going to but they did it so well.

Huge-Jacked-Man's serious nature combined with Deadpool's un-family friendly humor gives a result as a spine-chilling action movie meant for touching every Marvel fan's heart. And now I'm at a HUGE cliffhanger where I need to choose between ""No Way Home"" and this movie, to be my favorite movie now. IN NO REALITY I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO BE HERE!

480,1.0,25-Jul-24,"For starters, this is the first real multiverse MCU movie. And by that, I mean it finally feels like a multiverse through a constant rain of cameos - even if it's fan service on steroids, somehow keeps managing to keep that away from being disruptive. It totally reminds you of the comics, where known characters of a broader world can simply come and go, because moviemaking ramifications don't apply.Aesthetically, this is the most stylised movie of the Deadpool franchise and sets a great example for the rest of the future MCU projects to adopt. Without giving anything away, I would say that it totally opens up the road for Secret Wars and the Mutant Saga.The acting is astounding, especially from Hugh Jackman who demonstrates how seriously he still takes that role. Every single actor had their time to shine as well and that's very honourable from Ryan Reynolds, who deliberately didn't attempt to make his character outshine anyone.The action scenes and the choreography are taking your eyes hostages by force. There were plenty of scenes where I self-reflected by saying ""what kind of sorcery am I experiencing right now?"".The humour gives you the same fresh feel the previous ones had when they came out, but it's more meta and packed. That known feeling of doubt: ""how they got away with that?"" has done a comeback for good.To the downside, some plot points feel a bit off, but the movie itself teaches you to not take them seriously. Even if it could totally be at least a 9/10 construction wise, you simply know that it doesn't want to be (its EXTREME amount of self-awareness is all-time record worthy). Plus, considering how this project was even made, during a major writer strike and near the completion of a studio acquisition, this outcome is a statistical improbability. Still, it is the best MCU movie until No Way Home that came out 3 years ago.Will it save the MCU? It certainly could, but not by itself and that's another theme in its core DNA. Marvel Studios are letting you know this movie will be an example of what's to come, as it should.LFG.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
481,7.0,24-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is not good. Pure comedy and the action sequences are mid.The movie is about a much like no way home and endgame themed multiversal story mix with r-rated tone. Multiverse is a unique story to the MCU which makes them down.The suit of wolverine is good even his action scenes are amazing. Hugh's acting very fit to his character role as wolverine.The rest of the scenes are comedy, jokes even though it's not that kinda funny. Forcing you to laugh.Overall, I don't think the MCU will be saved and my guess is right. Personal rating: 2/10.

The rush of the first time has waned, and I have experienced so many new and exciting sessions since, and memories can only take you so far.Happy to report, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it!Not the perfect night, with my experience, I know there were many missed opportunities to give D more depth, and frustratingly when the tempo started hitting the right places it would jarringly change, as a whole it wasn't as filling, or as satisfying, but ohhhh boy I can promise the nostalgia and clever mid-session foreplay really pushed me over edge. It was not D, D2 or Once Upon a D in execution, mostly because it suffered from a desire to up the ante from such a dry place, I would describe the setup as a clumsy effort, but I was not ready for the juicy slab that was to come!In summary, I love D and I don't think that will change.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
483,7.0,25-Jul-24,"Reading some critics reviews recently and I think they've missed the point completely. Sure there are a few shaky moments where the odd joke falls flat but this is in essence a buddy movie and one where your instantly on the side of the protagonist's. The main duo need to get from here to there encountering a few bumps along the way making a few friends, defeating the villain and coming out the other side all the wiser from their adventures. Hugh and Ryan work well together,the chemistry is undeniable. It's a shame the ancillary characters we've come to know from the previous films are not in the movie more, aside from Peter and his piercings, but including them more would have dragged out the runtime. I really enjoyed the villains Emma Corrin is fantastic as Charles Xavier's little sister, she creeps me out in real life and does the same on screen. MacFadyen as Mr Paradox is a pleasure to watch also. I have been wondering for ages about whose severed head Cassandra was carrying through the portal and now it all makes sense. I loved this movie even more because I had a small part in it. Take the kids along I reckon anyone over the age of 12 would have a blast. A definite 8/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It's a bit of a shame because the two first deadpools are joking constantly about not being able to be in the marvel universe...You can summarise the movie by:All previous characters have now less than 10 min screen timeJust like sugar, it's good, but too much of it and it's gross. That's where Meh-rvel stand at the moment, with a universe that is clearly out of ideas, and relying on cameos and cgi to save the face. And it influenced badly on this movie.The two main actors are the only thing saving a mediocre storySo yeah... I liked the movie, it was very enjoyable, but I would probably not watch it again.

How I loveeeee the way that Ryan making fun of every single thing ( which I relate to lol) , the test of humour is a 10 and the guests in the move I was like whattttttt the people in the theatre where literally screaming, clapping and even whistling.

The whole theater was laughing and cheering throughout the movie. The story can be a little confusing, but it was fun all the way, I didn't feel bored even for a second. The action was very bloody and goofy, the jokes were hardcore and the movie is very meta. The one thing I especially liked is that there are actually emotional scene that aren't actually undercut with jokes, a thing that a lot of newer MCU movies tend to do. But this is still more of a Fox than a MCU movie. If you liked previous Deadpool movies you'll like this one too. Hugh Jackman is amazing as Wolverine and the cameos are really something special, especially because they're usually more that just that.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The actor playing Deadpool ""Ryan Reynolds""; he speaks a lot that become annoying and utterly absurd. His acting is an average but he talking non-stop became pain in the butt. Wolverine on the other hand was a decent and experienced actor and he played his part well but his fight scenes with Deadpool are lengthy, boring and quite out of proportion. Apart from other Marvel movies this one was the utter disappointment and wastage of time. Even the actor who played Paradox his acting was quite impressive and much graceful. All other Marvel movies are way better than this parody of the movie. I will rate this move 4 out of 10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
488,9.0,29-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is freaking UNREAL! I have never laughed harder in an MCU film before; this was an exhilarating, extremely fun time at the movies! It's the shot in the arm the MCU so desperately needed. Vulgar, violent, scathing, and at times, even touching, this R-rated romp holds nothing back delivering everything its fans want with maximum effort. It even manages to pay respect to the Fox era's legacy while ushering in a new one for Marvel Studios!The hype truly paid off beautifully - I left the theatre with the biggest smile on my face! Did I just see the best film of 2024? Definitely not. With that being said, this might actually be the most entertaining movie I've seen all year! Two things can be true simultaneously: a film can be a great theatrical experience full of cheering, whooping, and excitement and still be structurally and narratively deficient. They're not mutually exclusive, and both perceptions deserve acknowledgment. But honestly, I don't even care about the issues this film has. Yes, it has flaws, it's messy, and it has a meandering plot filled with indulgent cameos and a paper-thin villain. And yet, I loved it. It brought me so much joy, I enjoyed the hell out of it and don't want to stop rewatching it (I've already seen it twice)! So yeah... 5 stars. I had the best time watching this movie.This feels like a comic book come to life for better and worse. It feels damn great to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine and his hilarious banter with the pitch-perfect Ryan Reynolds is the heart of what makes this entertaining film work over its convoluted multiverse plot. Reynolds and Jackman truly are a perfect pairing - and getting to see Deadpool and Wolverine on screen together after so many years is just pure magic! Their dynamic onscreen is reminiscent of films like Planes, Trains & Automobiles, Midnight Run, and 48 Hours - I loved this film for not trying to be anything except a buddy road trip movie with a lot of laughs and heart.Those who show up for the dynamic between our heroes will get an insane amount of payoff; numerous moments between Deadpool and Wolverine that will leave you smiling long after the movie ends! Not to mention the insane surprises along the way. I'm actually quite shocked at how much they were able to keep secret. A lot of these moments are way too spoilery to talk about in detail - but I loved the way that the cameos (which are moreso strong yet small supporting roles across the story) all served a strong narrative purpose, contributing to the overall themes of the film as well as serving as a poignant farewell and celebration of the Fox era of films! Truly one of my favourite things about Deadpool & Wolverine is its veneration of the Fox universe. I walked in expecting ""Deadpool and friends move to the MCU, screw everything else lol"" but the whole movie is a love letter to a messier but very important time for these kinds of movies, celebrating the value in the fun, weird, uneven films, and occasionally flawed films and rejected ideas that paved the way before and outside of the MCU. Most importantly, this film respects what has come before and doesn't just disregard it.What else did I love? The action is bloody, brutal and so much fun, the opening credits might be my favourite in the entire MCU, it has sky-high energy and is constantly hilarious with some awesome meta-humour that pokes fun at the MCU, Disney, Kevin Feige, filmmaking, as well as the film industry, all complemented by a plethora of epic needle drops, camera work, and some top-notch editing. I thought Shawn Levy did a fantastic job in the director's chair and handled the tone beautifully, crafting and weaving together such memorable comedic moments, fun action scenes, and a true sense of emotional insight and focus on the characters. This movie has a surprising amount of heart and a strong emotional core - balancing the humour and emotion so well.Does this reinvent the wheel? No. Did it need to? Absolutely not. What it does is reinvigorate the franchise and inject the glorious madness of Deadpool in the best (and most self-aware) way. It is entirely aware of the type of insane story that it is telling, and that is occasionally messy, yet there are still plenty of heartfelt moments with Jackman especially. It has its fair share of narrative flaws, but it delivered everything I needed and left me energized once it ended. Deadpool & Wolverine really is a blast like no other! It delivers a phenomenal theatrical experience - it's so much fun to see with an audience! I laughed so hard I almost cried and can't wait to see this again right away! To me, it's perfect, no notes. It gets better and better each time I see it - I adore this movie and just have so much fun with it! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and Shawn Levy delivered truly everything I could have asked for!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
489,9.0,26-Jul-24,"This movie was made by Ryan Reynolds to appeal to an audience of a generation familiar with NSYNC and animated X-men's Wolverine. I sit in that demographic and found this movie to be a non-stop barrel of laughs with breaks for action, some of which was filled with laughter also. If you remember NSYNC, appreciate fight scenes, understand the comedy in the relationship between the actors and get a kick out of the 4th wall being broken with Logan/Wokverine being referred to as ""Hugh"".... The things that make it bad just make it better. It's a brilliant movie and is such a neat idea in all else it does for 'lesser' movie characters who are great and deserve respect however are not great enough to join that group of immortals known as the Avengers.

490,9.0,29-Jul-24,"Here are the reasons I think this deserves the ten. It's a Deadpool movie, so it's going to be riddled with gratutious swearing, violence, and obviously not appropriate for children. However, this also has references that those of us who are comic fans will absolutely love. It also has a plot that is surprisingly fantastic, especially when you consider the curse of the sequels. It has the depth buried under humor that makes Marvel what it is. It has the tie in to the MCU and if this is what we can expect out of phase five, then Marvels got my attention back. I also appreciate Ryan and the other writers intention with cameos. If someone is featured in a movie, there's a reason for them. This movie doesn't just feature random people for two seconds, they gave each cameo a reason for showing up in the film, even if it's not an especially long cameo.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Anyone who says they didn't enjoy this is either a troll or just trying to be different cause this film was the highlight of my year, despite the whole Deadpool slashy slashy, sex sex, curse curse plot it still managed to have a heartwarming story just like the easy with an amazing ending wrapped in a neat little bow until Disney decides they want another because marvel hasn't been paying out since endgame. The inclusion of past characters even if it was just cameos like negasonic, komiko (sorry if I spelt that wrong) and big communist iron hulk etc etc just made this film a thousand times better, I have no complaints it was jus at a great film and if you're looking for you're next excuse to eat to much popcorn, feel sick and laugh at sex jokes for 2 hours look no further than this masterpiece, would see again 5/5 Ryan Reynolds you did it again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
492,1.0,29-Jul-24,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool was as funny as ever and combine that with wolverine, you have probably the funniest duo in the marvel universe. The cameos were also great, with each one came a lot of laughs. If you want something to just watch and enjoy after a long day but still want action, this is your movie. It's got the right amount of action mixed with comedy to let you relax but also have a good time. And the opening scene! If i could have replayed it in the cinema, I would've.

After delivering more bad than good in recent years, the MCU finally strikes back with a solid, fun and gruesomely violent experience that rewards the fans of old. The team-up that always felt like it was destined to happen absolutely delivered. With the ultimate straight man to bounce off of in the form of Wolverine, the character of Deadpool really gets to shine, both in the action and humor department. Most of the fan service was handled surprisingly sincerely and almost everyone had a moment to shine. The movie's only real problem lies with the bland score and mostly uninspired visuals that almost every MCU movie comes packaged with.

Not the songs I would have chosen personally but they make them work.Literally hilarious from the first moment to the end. Opening credits are the best opening credits i've ever seen. The movie is very self contained so it doesn't really set up a future movie and doesn't really 'save the mcu' but its definitely a return to form.Some amazing action and fight scenes.Some great expected and unexpected cameos. Plenty of Deadpool variants and Wolverine variants.Excellent closure for some old Fox Marvel characters who maybe didn't get a great showing until now (or at all).Great nods to current state of Marvel.On the negative side, it was a little too goofy at times and I had a few nitpicks with a couple of the costumes.9/10 go see it and maybe see it twice.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Soooo many cameos in this film which will appease some fanboys but to anyone else they will be like who's that.

Deadpool & Wolverine is not so much of a movie, but a plain vehicle for delivering lots of sharp stuff into squishy, bloody flesh with the occasional shredding, ripping, and twisting.As with most of the more lighthearted Marvel fare, we get another focus-grouped Soundtrack of Our Lives, with longing for salad days creeping in at every moment. However, just as the soundtrack represents a poor mix of retro pop, the movie itself is a poor mix of upbeat comedy with maudlin nostalgia.It's hard to deny there are a handful of funny jokes or gags, and most of the fight scenes are suitably intense. They have made another movie, people are paying to see it, it was nice to see Logan again, and Ryan Reynolds is overmuch. Why not skip any attempt at whatever the plot might be, given that I think it's just another unfathomably powerful villain bent on destroying as much as possible.Why not make a straightforward martial-arts movie, about 90 minutes, nothing but action sequences? That's all we want, no need to haplessly slap together such quotidian and ephemeral exposition.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The most important part is missing from this movie: A good and compelling story. The cameos and the typical Deadpool quips were quite entertaining at times and I even chuckled a few times, but the overlong runtime doesn't help this film even in the slightest. There are no stakes, there are no surprises. Overall it's boring and quite uneventful. Cameos and referencing stuff aren't a substitute for a story and frankly it's overdone now. Hollywood needs to start to write good stories again, with actual stakes and actual surprises. Deadpool & Wolverine has none of that. There is no depth. It's just a shallow experience, which you'll forget the moment you walk out of the cinema. This movie is a glowing reminder for the sad state of modern cinema and it's success doesn't really reflect well on the current state of the modern social media crowd. Don't think, just consume product. And that's what it is at the end. Mindless entertainment for mindless people.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Just like there are different colors and flavors, there are different types of movies, and Deadpool is made to entertain, which it does 100%.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were born to play Deadpool and Wolverine, respectively, and it shows.The lowest point of this movie, besides the plot, is the villain-too forgettable, too bland, and almost evoking no reaction. You don't really feel the threat or hate the character enough to root for your hero or anti-hero to take them down ASAP. There's no backstory or real motive behind their actions.

I think the plot is a bit rushed or perhaps the incorporation of scenes that would explain some small gaps was missing. In general terms, very well seen and pleasant from start to finish. Chris Evans' participation could have been better used since it had an impact on the public. In short, it is a great film that restores hope to the Marvel public, after End Game.

Deadpool was constantly making jokes, which belongs to him, but I don't know. I thought it was a little too much. The thing I dislike most about this is how the multiverse showed up again, as Marvel likes to do lately and I'm pretty sick of it. On the one hand, great action with a pretty nice soundtrack.

But when it's an overcast summer afternoon and the wife wants to go see it on, you go to see it.This was the first movie in the franchise that I did see in the theaters and I am so glad that I did, because it was AWESOME! I know that some off the references and possible Easter Eggs went over head, but I was surprised with the amount that did land. The thing that I like the most about the Deadpool movies is the juvenile humor, the fourth wall breaking, and the over the top gore!

I liked the cameos but I felt they were not as gud as they could have been. I mean juggernaut was lame and channing tatam. They were b list cameos.

524,1.0,6-Aug-24,"The multiverse concept has been a staple in superhero films for a while now, but with Deadpool and Wolverine, it feels like a parody of the genre was long overdue. This film leans into its absurdity with the kind of sharp wit and humor that only Deadpool can deliver, making it a refreshing take on a trope that many believe has run its course.From the start, Deadpool and Wolverine takes its time building momentum. The pacing may feel slow at first, but trust me, it's worth the wait. The jokes come fast and furious, with almost every gag hitting the mark. Some jokes are more memorable than others, but the overall comedic tone is consistent throughout. The film's fourth-wall breaks are the best we've seen in the trilogy, with Deadpool gleefully mocking both the multiverse and its tired conventions.There is a bit of a pacing hiccup in the middle of the film, as the exposition drags on a little longer than it should. However, this lull is more than compensated for by the film's unapologetic fan service. The movie knows what its audience wants and delivers in spades, offering a buffet of references, cameos, and nods to both the comics and previous films.While Deadpool and Wolverine steal the spotlight, I wish the side characters had more depth and chemistry with one another. There are moments where the supporting cast feels like mere props, lacking the dynamic interaction that could have elevated the narrative. This isn't a dealbreaker, but it leaves you wanting more from the talented ensemble that supports our two leads.The ending is nothing short of unforgettable. The entire climax is a spectacle of chaos and hilarity, and the choice of song and its mixing is executed to perfection. It's a fitting conclusion to a film that revels in its absurdity and self-awareness, cementing its status as a parody of a dying genre.Deadpool and Wolverine is a stellar superhero comedy, expertly satirizing the overdone multiverse concept while delivering a fun, engaging, and laugh-out-loud experience. It's a must-see for fans of the franchise and anyone who appreciates a good laugh at the expense of superhero tropes.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
525,7.0,26-Jul-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is an explosive, R-rated thrill ride that delivers on its promise of non-stop action and irreverent humor. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is electric, their on-screen banter as sharp as Wolverine's claws. The film is a visual spectacle, with jaw-dropping fight sequences that showcase the characters' brutal fighting styles.The film is a non-stop barrage of pop culture references and meta-commentary, often at the expense of coherent storytelling. While this approach undoubtedly delivers laughs and nostalgic thrills, it also raises concerns about the film's longevity. As pop culture evolves, some of these jokes are bound to land with a thud.Ultimately, Deadpool and Wolverine is a fun, if disposable, spectacle. It's a film that rewards dedicated fans with a treasure trove of Easter eggs, but casual viewers may find themselves lost in the whirlwind of references. While it's a thrilling ride while it lasts, the film's reliance on nostalgia might limit its appeal in the years to come.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
526,3.0,29-Jul-24,"This film was definitely made with the fans in mind. It loads up on the nostalgia with an assortment of cameos from previous films and a few other surprise characters. While the plot is the weakest part of the whole movie, it is easy to forget the story while watching it because there is so much going on. The constant jokes and breaking of the fourth wall kept things entertaining and lighthearted. But there were tons of sexual references that might be off putting to some if they are not into raunchy jokes. The violence and gore made for some cool fight scenes. The music didn't always work but that intro has to be one of the most memorable.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's chemistry is over the top. This often felt like a buddy cop film with the constant banter between the two and it worked perfectly. Of the two characters, Wolverine had the more interesting story. Deadpool on the other hand had a very simple motive that made his story and purpose in this film feel like an afterthought.This film lacked the tension it needed to make it feel like there was a lot at stake. Part of the problem was that the villain never truly felt threatening. The film drags for too long before the villain is put in a position to become a threat. By the time this happens the story is nearing its predictable conclusion.While this film wasn't perfect, fans will now have a sense of hope for the future of the MCU. The multiverse allowed for the introduction of Wolverine into this universe without tarnishing the previous Logan (2017) story. This film also sets up so many possibilities involving Wolverine and the X-men in the future. In conclusion, this film is one of the most impactful films in the MCU and it does it with nonstop entertainment.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Breaking the fourth wall and being meta are good in moderation but doing that in every scene dilutes its effectiveness.If gratuitous cameos, violence, and name drops are enough to keep you engaged for 2 hours, then you can definitely watch this.

Heck, they gave Ryan Gosling an award for Ken, playing Joker has been given two awards to two different actors, why couldn't playing Wolverine, Hugh Jackman at his best in the role, be given the same treatment?

If you've enjoyed Marvel's recent projects, this probably won't bother you. The best part of the film is definitely the cameos-Reynolds clearly wanted to honor the Fox era of Marvel, even though Disney seems to ignore it. Seeing those familiar faces gave me the same thrill I felt when I first saw those movies as a kid.

Hey guys, what about if I say this. He, he. Poor Wolverine has to put up with it. Through the history of Logan in every film he's quite a serious guy. Now he has to put up with all the silliness all the time. And what about all this timelines? Did anyone get it? Yes I understand that Disney has to milk every cent of the characters they bought.

538,9.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is delightful entertainment. An over the top spectacle, a marvellous rollercoaster but an endearing experience that focuses on character and emotion when it needs to. The script keeps a fine balance between humour and drama. It never feels like it's leaning too far to one side. There's jokes and gags aplenty, with Reynolds delivering his best performance yet as the ""merc with the mouth."" Ryan's respect and passion for the source material pays off in spades. It's testament to his dedication to the role because Deadpool finally evolves past the wisecracks and into something more tangible and sympathetic. He's still Deadpool but he's all grown up and he's back with a new companion in wolverine. If I had doubts about Jackman returning to the role, all concerns are effectively dismissed. This is perhaps his best performance, outshining his performance in Logan by a small margin. Jackman is magnificent here adding depth and nuance to wolverine with such distinction, it has to be seen, to be believed. The oddball bromance between these two is the central focus of the film, both carrying the narrative with finesse. It's clear this film was made with compassion and dignity because the film has heart. The emphasis on making Wade and Logan two broken, dysfunctional men, both on a path of redemption, both heroes at their core, is what makes Deadpool & Wolverine a classic entry in the superhero genre. It's pure unadulterated fun, that packs many surprises, is hyper-violent, stylistically glorious but most importantly it's emotionally driven. The film does enough to keep a smile on your face throughout its runtime. Deadpool and wolverine reminds us that comicbook movies can be fun and poignant at the same time, in my opinion that's the best kind. Go see it.

Their dynamic was very fun and felt very natural, both Deadpool and Wolverine really were the heart and soul of this movie. The side characters were pretty much all pretty fun too!My biggest complaints were that the love interest side plot felt super unnecessary and pointless (not a first for Marvel) and the middle section of the movie seemed to lose a bit of steam pacing-wise, but it picked back up in time for a great act 3!Overall this movie was a great time, and I will certainly be watching it again!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I realise it should be an easy question to answer but its not so simple with Deadpool and Wolverine. Did I enjoy the film ? YES ! , Is it a great film ? NO ! To be honest , its not even a 'good' film but the thing that makes it fun is the relationship of the two titular characters and the obvious chemistry both these friends share , on and off screen. The plot , what there is of it , is exceedingly thin and whilst its milliseconds of fun seeing the much hyped and talked about cameos , they do little to enhance the story or increase your enjoyment ; if anything they slow the narrative eve further . I wanted to love this film .I desperately wanted Marvel to go back to something that I could rewatch over and over and my none uber-nerd friends could enjoy just as much , but this ISNT that film . This film is already smashing box office records and long may it continue but this ISN'T a great movie - Its fun , its grossly over the top and once or twice , it even manages to pull at the heart strings . The big problem for me was the ending , which is so telegraphed that even 'Blind Al' could see it. The last 20 minutes leading up to it has our heroes face off against the Deadpool Corp , the majority or which can regenerate after meeting ridiculously violent 'deaths ' , this is hammered home to give the filmmakers the ending they wanted . Ultimately , my final decision if a movie is good or bad comes down to if I will go back and watch it at the cinema , or buy it on Blu Ray when its available and the answer to both of those is a resounding NO !.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

545,6.0,5-Aug-24,"Six years after Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has a quieter life as a car salesman, but he is not that happy. His birthday is crashed by the Time Variance Authority who offer to bring him into a world where he will be recognized, but in that process, his world that has everyone he cares about gets destroyed. After refusing the offer, Wade is sent to the Void and forced to work with the ""worst"" Wolverine to save his own world.That is just the surface of what happens in this crazy movie.I had a great time with Deadpool and Wolverine. It is far from perfect, but I was never bored with this movie. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are a match made in heaven with their chemistry. They play off each other perfectly with Deadpool's crazy comedic antics and Wolverine's serious, deadpan expressions. It is cool to see them finally star in a movie together as the titular characters. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool is exactly how I expected him to be. Reynolds is hilarious and badass in this role, but he also has some great emotional moments, especially concerning his friends in his universe. Some of his humor could be a little cringy at times, especially in the beginning, but Reynolds does a great job here. Hugh Jackman however steals the show. Jackman has a lot of great facial expressions and subtle moments of emotion that can say so much about this version of Wolverine, but his dialogue delivery is on point. His rant towards Deadpool is absolute gold with how vicious and somewhat accurate it is with how his selfish actions and big mouth led them to a low moment. Wolverine is the heart of the movie overall and Jackman absolutely kills it bringing the best emotional beats in the film. Reynolds and Jackman are awesome in this movie and I could see them do another movie together, maybe without their superhero suits.Cassandra Nova is an excellent villain. She is a force of nature who is the perfect villain for two heroes who seem nearly invulnerable to fight. Her psychic powers make her legitimately threatening and frightening. Also, her personality is evil for the sake of petty for the most part and I admire her evilness. Her first scene represents her dangerous and vile nature beautifully and it is one of the best introductions to a villain I have seen in a comic book movie in a while. Emma Corrin nailed this villain. They have a blast hamming it up and snarking while also proving to be a frightening screen presence. Corrin makes this character fun and intense to watch while making us root against Nova. Cassandra Nova is by far the best villain in the Deadpool movies and one of the best in the MCU.The supporting cast is not who I expected to be and this is where it gets a little spoilery. Deadpool's friends are sidelined in this film aside from Peter who is absolutely delightful in the few scenes he is in. Vanessa is unfortunately wasted again and it is a shame because I always thought her relationship with Wade was one of the best parts about the first film. The rest of his friends are mostly at Deadpool's birthday party.Instead of Deadpool's friends, most of the supporting characters are past superheroes from Marvel movies from Fox or other studios. The actors from those roles reprise them here. Everyone is game and there is a standout here for me. I love that they got so many stars to come back despite it being years since they played these roles and they are mostly treated with dignity and they come off as cool and heroic. The cast is fantastic and they make this movie so fun to watch.The story is very fun and often engaging. As a multiverse movie, it has a lot of references to past comic book movie heroes, a lot of which were from the 20th Century Fox Marvel movies. They are handled pretty well despite a few cameos of them being little more than jokes because they are utilized like characters in a trapped world. The original actors for these characters return and they make the most of their appearances injecting life into them. A couple of the cameos really surprised me. While the movie does feel bigger than a simple sequel to Deadpool 2, this is still his story about his quest to save his friends and his love-hate friendship with Wolverine.Behind all of the nostalgia and references lies a story about working towards a better future and not dwelling on the past. Also, despite Deadpool wanting to have more of a purpose, he is not willing to make a deal that will destroy his family making this also a film about family coming first. The story is far from perfect, but it is executed far better than I thought it would be for a movie that takes place in a multiverse.The tone of the movie mixes the comedic craziness of Deadpool and the serious and dark past of the ""worst"" Wolverine. On paper, this sounds like a recipe that could clash with each other, but Shawn Levy does a good job balancing comedy, action and drama here. The dramatic parts are never compromised by the comedy in this movie which makes them more effective. The humor is hilarious for the most part. There are several lines of dialogue and moments of physical comedy that cracked me up, especially some of the references and how they are used. A couple of cringy lines poking fun of Disney aside (they go on just a bit too long), this is probably the most that I laughed at a film since Abigail. The pacing is overall pretty fast even though the first 20 minutes are a bit on the slow side. Once Deadpool searches for Wolverine, the movie goes by at a brisk pace, but it never feels rushed.Visually, it is a bit of a mixed bag. The costumes are amazing. The Deadpool costume is as lively and expressive as ever, but Wolverine's costume looks very cool too. It could have come off as too cartoony, but it does not. The action scenes are very entertaining to watch and beautifully shot and edited, especially one fight right before the climax and the battle with Deadpool and Wolverine's new squad. The action gets very bloody and graphic even compared to the first two Deadpool movies, but that is what makes it more entertaining for me because this movie holds nothing back. There is one scene that had me shook a little bit because it came out of nowhere. The special effects look pretty good for the most part aside from a few moments of iffy CGI, and the fight choreography is on point, especially the duels between Deadpool against Wolverine.The sets could have been a little more colorful and lively. I get that the movie was going for a desperate and post-apocalyptic vibe with the Void, but it looks nowhere near as impressive as the likes of Dune: Part Two and Furiosa. There are some cool sets like the snowy area in the opening scene and Cassandra's hideout, but I expected the locations to look more impressive for a Marvel movie. The cinematography features some great looking shots that are a bit hindered by the monochromatic colors of the environment, but colorful characters pop. The most impressive looking shot is a long-take fight scene in the third act that feels like a comic book come to life. The soundtrack is awesome. As far as a movie with multiple songs goes, this movie probably has the best soundtrack of the year. I cannot say what I liked more: Deadpool and Wolverine fighting to AC/DC's ""Hell's Bells"" or them fighting to ""You're the One that I Want"" from Grease! Seriously, whoever put those song choices in those fights deserves a raise.Aside from the flaws and a couple visuals that could have looked better, I had a great time with this movie. Deadpool and Wolverine is a blast to watch. The opening scene alone had me pumped up for the rest of the film. Ryan Reynolds brought this character to life in this entire trilogy and I am grateful he showed how funny and badass of a character Deadpool is. These three movies brought a lot of joy in the theater for both me and my mom. I can tell that everyone involved in this movie had just as much fun making it and it shows in every second.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
546,1.0,1-Aug-24,"Watched movie without taking Deadpool as serious character because he obviously isn't, but this sequel balance that part of wanting to matter as Marvel character and staying specific in presentation of what kind of character he is. Nobody takes him serious because of his behavior, so that starts to be a challenge for Deadpool. Meanwhile, while making that balance, there is a lot of punchlines, references, Easter eggs and ""talking"" to audience, so the accent of the movie was often breaking the 4th Wall, which I think is interesting, but not in that extent because it affected a story a lot and made it chaotic and sometimes without context. Anyway, it was fun to watch with friends and laugh a lot, enjoyed watching something different from Marvel and would like to see other characters to be a little not family friendly as it is Deadpool.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It's not just an action movie with things blowing up.This movie lacked all of this. There was no plot but an endless scenes of fighting that for me are not interesting. The humor is much lesser than expected and the romance was missing.If you like to see things blow up and fighting scenes- then it could be a fun movie for you. But if you need something extra or some sensible plot- it's better to choose a different movie.That's all I have to say :))","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I think I will need to watch it few more times to catch all the jokes and Easter Eggs and references, because there is lietrally not a minute of boring ""just to fill the time"" blanks. It's all fun, action, jokes and craziness from start to finish. As the first two Deadpool movies, this one is completely crazy and ridiculous, maybe more than other two, maybe even too much. It's completely over the top and if you like that you will love this movie!Actors are mainly my generation (gen X) which I enjoyed a lot, and they all look ridiculously good. I mean, it's an eye candy wherever you look, actors, crazy CGI, very unsafe jokes... It was a wild ride and I would do it again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
549,8.0,26-Jul-24,"Look, I am giving a clear review, the movie of Deadpool and Wolverine has been made very well, there was just a little lack in the writing and in the plot and the writing of the villain in the movie could have been a little improved, but it will work fine, yhe only thing that is missing from this movie is that it lacks a little plot and the cameos that has been shown about it is only understandable to hardcore Marvel fans. For those who are new to Marvel, it will be a little over the top for them. No one would know who all the characters were if they haven't seen the X-Men franchise. Overall, it is value for money, complete entertainment and the good thing about a movie is that it keeps the audience with it, only its connection with the villain is not full, We are able to connect with the both main characters and with the side characters and cameos from all the movie that he has appeared in.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

556,4.0,25-Jul-24,"2024's most hyped and anticipated team up is finally here, an arrival that is sure to get box office tills ringing and fanboys clapping as loudmouthed mercenary Wade Wilson/Deadpool teams up with Logan/Wolverine in Deadpool & Wolverine, a joint venture that many hoped achieves better on screen results than the last time these two were seen on screen together in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine.A film that has been the victim of much discussion and reported set leaks etc. As many tried to uncover just what this team up would be all about and who may be joining our titular anti-hero's for the ride, D & W is undoubtedly going to be a crowd-pleasing box office behemoth but it's not the saviour of the MCU that some may have been hoping for as Shawn Levy's feature becomes one of those entertaining, if oddly throwaway events that will find its equal share of detractors amongst those championing its glories.In simplistic terms D & W is a fun film, one that begins with a massive Bye Bye Bye backed backed bang and for anyone that's enjoyed the past two Deadpool experiences it's highly likely that this could become the new favourite but with an oddly weak plot that is hampered by more than its fair share of clunky exposition, a growing sense through the runtime that the novelty factor is wearing off and a sadly grumpy Wolverine, this big-budgeted event film has lots of enjoyable elements but not the entire recipe to become the instant classic/MCU messiah some were hoping for.Sharing a great on-screen and off-screen chemistry, it's great to finally see Reynolds and Jackman get a chance to play-off one another in such a big way here and while it feels slightly sacrilegious that Jackman would be dug up from his iconic send off back in 2017's Logan, it's hard to deny that it's great to see Jackman don the claws once more, even if you wish he was allowed the same type of zany and crazy allowances that Reynolds gets as the comedically tinged vitriol spewing Deadpool.Amongst the joy of seeing these two A-listers walk hand in hand and also on more than one occasion go head to head is the as to be expected cameo and wink wink moments littered throughout the film and as has become the normal for MCU films and TV shows with different realities being explored, D & W is allowed to get pretty wild with who and how and even seasoned fans are going to be surprised by who comes along for various stages of this journey, with many of these moments becoming some of the best of the film.Another notable win for the film amongst the instantly forgettable plot and some not always welcome attempts at big emotional stakes around the constant cussing and anatomy jokes is D & W's action scenes that are likely to rank amongst the most entertaining in Marvel's cinematic history and by taking all the liberties he's allowed with this ventures mature rating (this really is not a film for the young MCU watchers), Levy holds nothing back in the violence stakes, ensuring we have never seen carnage quite like this before from a company that has made its bread and butter by creating all ages entertainment.After a few lean years (that are on more than one occasion referenced here in some fairly brutal occurrences), D & W arrives at an intriguing time for Marvel's big and small screen ventures and while it fails to really light a fire or create some momentous step in the direction their heading, there's a lot of throwaway fun to be had here even if its unlikely this loud, brash and unforgiving team-up is going to be that fondly remembered once the dust has settled.Final Say -With some great guests, some frenetic action set pieces and some jokes you should absolutely not be laughing at, Deadpool & Wolverine is a good solid adult orientated action comedy but one that never truly becomes the grand spectacle many would've been hoping for in a time that the MCU is seeking it's next golden goose.3 Enya albums out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I asked the universe to make the theater abruptly stop this garbage either by a comet colliding with the earth or a tsunami. What kind of mentally ill people wrote the screenplay for D&W?

559,9.0,26-Jul-24,"I will write at the very beginning about the fact that the film does not require the viewer to have a thorough knowledge of films and TV series. Yes, there is an organization that has been given as many as 2 seasons of Loki, but the authors kindly explain and show all the rules quickly for the ignorant.After 3 spider-Men in one frame 2.5 years ago, the effect is certainly different, but damn, how cool is it!This text was written by a child, because when something good from Marvel comes out, I turn into him.Those who said that only the first 40 minutes of the film were shown in the trailers were slightly lying, because they showed literally the entire film, not counting the ending, but is it so bad?The plot is simple and in general, such paintings are not watched because of this.The Dead Pool finds the right Wolverine to save all the universes from destruction. A bald girl is responsible for the destruction. I won't say what kind of character it is necessary to keep the intrigue.Along the way, there will be a bunch of characters from old and even very old Marvel movies. Some in order to create a funny situation, and some, even in these, sincerely want to believe that intentionally bad costumes are just nice to look at. Little time is given to the funny ones, and more time is given to the serious guys. This is encouraging.Did I say that the movie is funny? Most likely, if you are not familiar with the universe, then half of the jokes will pass by, but the second one will remain, and if you like the first 2 parts, then you will also like this one.If you try to evaluate +- objectively, discarding the appearance of old characters, then the film is 8, but I told you that I am a child, so + score.One day, people will get bored with all these multiverse, at least now everything suits everyone. It will be interesting to see something similar, but with a different composition.Well, a few words about the director. The director of the Marvel film does not have any creative freedom, so with a good script and actors it turns out almost always well, and this time it is generally excellent. If you compare with the last stream of ... over the last 2.5 years. Perhaps this impression is just because of the contrast, but personally I do not recognize it.Go to the cinema if you have the opportunity. As for me, this is the best movie in the last 7 months.P.

I'll try my best to keep this review spoiler-free.From starting to finish this movie was an unforgettable theatrical experience. The entire theatre was laughing and cheering for the return of these beloved characters. The soundtrack freaking slaps. The action is well choreographed, bloody and gruesome, the comedy lands perfectly and the emotional moments hit hard. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool were fantastic and their chemistry was off the charts. There were some cameos that were utilised pretty well in the movie. Plus the movie is loaded with Easter eggs that MCU Stans will gobble up. The pacing is done well that the 2 hrs runtime flies by. Shawn Levy directed the hell outta this movie. I just loved the idea of them poking fun at the MCU and the movie industry in general.However I did feel that the story was a bit too confusing at times and the villain was underwhelming to say the least. So if you're going in expecting a great storyline then you might be disappointed. But those are my only criticisms. This is MCU's biggest movie of the decade after No Way Home and is destined to become this year's biggest blockbuster.Overall Deadpool and Wolverine is bloody, funny and emotional. It expertly balances it's bloody action and crude humour with such emotional moments. The two leads have impeccable chemistry and the movie celebrates the superhero genre while also poking fun at it. Even though the movie falters when it comes to telling a cohesive story, it still largely delivers everything Marvel fans have been wanting for and is destined to become a box office juggernaut.

563,6.0,25-Jul-24,"The movie delivers what it promised with the marketing. A consistent stream of MCU cameos combined with everything you'd expect from a Deadpool movie. This was also satisfying because you didn't have to watch a bunch of other projects just to understand who the characters are, and understand their motivations. Especially since this is the 3rd Deadpool movie, featuring Wolverine, who has had a lot more cinematic backstory. While it can definitely be used as a good jumping off point, it wasn't just a small piece of a bigger story. I feel like that aspect has been missing from most of the post Endgame MCU projects, with a couple of exceptions. I hope this is the type of quality they focus on going forward, not just a one-off, since it featured Wolverine. With a comic accurate portrayal, in a team-up movie that people have been wanting for a while. It feels like this was made possible because they finally listened to what the audience has been wanting. I hope that continues. It seems like they put a lot of effort into making this work, but the MCU has done that before, and unfortunately, returned to the same broken formula. I imagine that the movie will be successful. I just hope that Marvel will understand that all they have to do, is give the audience we want, and it's been no secret.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Seeing audience screaming again every minute in the cinema reminded me of the old Marvel.The special appearances are great fan service.

No real effort to make a storyline, just throws you in and doesn't care about how it got there. Just Reynolds being Reynolds(personally I've had enough), there were some moderately funny things, but nothing great. Sorry to say but this is the truth. The cameos were funny but that was the moderately funny stuff, Reynolds just says the same stuff he has said in the 1st 2 movies.

568,9.0,27-Jul-24,"Bottom of the line is deadpool and wolverine is extremely funny, entertaining with phenomal action and some great fan service and that's all I needed from this movie. The performances from renyolds and jackman were phenomal and Emma Corrin made a really striking impression as the villain. Tha action throughout the movie is amazing with some great set pieces and music intertwined leading to a final thirty minutes packed with joy, fun jokes and some really powerful emotional moments. Casandra nova makes for a thrilling villain who's just as evil as she is crazy and she makes for a real threat Emma Corrin takes this and fully runs with it. The movie never goes full multiverse crazy and pokes fun at other films that have done before it and it works to its strengths whilst there is a lot of fan service none of it feels unearned (and believe me there is a lot) that being said it does feel like at points the movie uses it as a crutch. The films pacing is great moving at a break neck pace from start to finish leading to no moments of Boredom it felt like a theme park experience more than a movie so take that as you will. The writing at points is very clever the jokes rarely fell flat and the way it utilized it's characters was really good. I really had so much fun with this movie and I was grinning ear to ear at several points and my whole screening was laughing at the jokes.I do however have a few gripes, having a character that can break the third wall is really fun and the writers often use it to poke fun at lazy writing throughout the movie but that doesn't negate the fact it's lazy writing. The film relies heavily on easy short cuts and heavy exposition to carry the thin plot. Yes by all means poke fun at exposition dumps but if you have the smarts to joke about it maybe avoid doing it yourself for example make it seem like a characters gonna go on an exposition dump make a joke about it then not carry through. Exposition is natural for movies and is extremelyuseful and effective when used right and at points here it's used amazingly but most of The time it feels lazy. In addition to this the film at points feels a little half baked I feel like they rushed this film because they needed something to save the mcu and whilst it leads to some of the most fun I've had in the cinema for a long time I still feel there is a lot of missing potential the plot is very thin it's very reliant on convenient events happen to progress the story. For example During the movie the characters need a form of transport to get to a location and they straight away get it , dont make it an issue if you can't resolve it properly. The cameos whilst really cool do feel extremely fan servicey when they are first introduced there are four ""cameos"" here that are fully blown support roles and their introduction literally has pauses in dialogue so the audience can supposedly cheer? I feel like that scene in particularly is gonna hold up awfully. Levy is a very strong director and we know this from his work on stranger things but that doesn't fully translate here yeah there as some fantastic shots and cool camera movements but it feels very generic for the majority of the movie. The cgi is great at points but lacklustre at others and some of the shot genuinely look really cheap for what is a very expensive movie.In conclusion, deadpool and wolverine is fun, enjoyable and extremely funny with phenomenal action, score, cgi, performances and at points some very clever writing with a slick run time of two hours it's just enough to overcome some major issues that previous mcu movies before it also suffered from. Whilst it's a step in the right direction marvel need to take more care of their projects in pre production rather than seeing what they can salvage in the editing room.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

570,9.0,11-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine starts out strong with Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Marvel's Deadpool. Wade Wilson is living a normal life and looking to fit in with the Avengers to be contributing for the common good. The TVA which is a time cop agency that makes sure all timelines are in place. The head of TVA lead by Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) convinces Deadpool he could be included on a team in a different timeline but his present timeline is in danger because of the death of Logan. Deadpool steals all the time dial to look for the right Wolverine to help him fix his timeline. Hugh Jackman returns as Logan and together they are sent to the Void where they encounter Marvel superhero's Electra, Gambit, Blade, and Teenage Wolverine where they are held captive by Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) who plays Professor X's sister. There were plenty of cameos from Blake Lively along with their children, Chris Evans, Nathan Fillon, Jon Favreau, Morena Baccarin, Henry Cavill, Rob Delaney, and Matthew McConaughey. Shawn Levy co-wrote and directed this with Ryan and I got to say they brought Marvel back from the age of Woke. The script poked so much fun at Disney and Marvel. I got to say this movie was so much fun, it was filled with so much gore, filthy jokes and so much action. We cannot wait to watch it again in the theaters.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I like my super hero films to have a sense of reality about them, as if it could possibly happen. Which is why films like Batman work better for me, but this one just goes too far. Both the premise of the film and the powers characters have are just too much.But at least Disney took a risk on it, and for a moment stopped pumping out more politically correct drivel.

573,6.0,25-Jul-24,"Like many fans I've become increasingly exasperated with the MCU. Trying to keep up with all these shows and characters and timelines is starting to become a bit of a chore. But this is one of the few post Endgame MCU instalments where I've gone to the theatre out of excitement rather than obligation in the hopes this would inject some much needed life into the franchise. And boy does it.If you've seen a Deadpool movie you'll know what to expect from this film. It is violent, lewd, bloody, and hilarious. The fourth wall breaks go even further than they have before to great effect. It pokes the right amount of fun out of the MCU whilst also showing plenty of love for Marvel through some surprising cameos. The action scenes are thoroughly entertaining and truly vicious at times.The introduction of Wolverine is very effective. It's not necessarily as emotional of an arc as I was expecting based on the trailer and what I'd read in interviews but it still works perfectly well. Seeing Hugh Jackman back in the role and adopting the iconic suit is just a whole lot of fun, especially now that he can fully let rip in this R rated version. Ryan Reynolds is terrific in a role he was born to play. He's just hilarious as Deadpool and you can tell he just connects with and understands the character to tremendous effect. The off screen friendship between the two carries through to their on screen chemistry which is hugely entertaining.My only criticism is that the core of the story is kind of bog standard and nothing too intriguing. Additionally, as is the case with a lot of movies, they don't really know what to do with their villain. Emma Corrin puts in a good performance so this is no criticism to them, but it's just not a particularly fleshed out or impacting villain to get stuck into.This is really a minor criticism of an otherwise hugely entertaining film. Deadpool fans, Wolverine fans, Marvel fans, get yourselves to theatres to have a brilliant time and restore some faith in the MCU. Marvel Jesus indeed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

576,1.0,29-Jul-24,"I have had mixed reactions with the Deadpool movies. The first one I thought was fun but a little too snarky. The second one I felt was a better story and less snarky. Here, Deadpool continues to break the forth wall, and makes jabs at Disney, seemingly aimed for the social media community. Self deprecation is always a virtue. Here, the movie goes straight up and acknowledges that Logan died in his last movie. Audiences seemed to agree it was time to move on, having been the cornerstone of the X men franchise for 17 years. It has been about seven years since Logan was released, six years since the last Deadpool. Long enough to have given this intense over-the-top character a breather. As for the return of Wolverine, there always seems to be the ability for Hollywood to convince both talent and audiences to make one more trip around the race track. For example, you had Matt Damon doing a fourth Bourne film after calling it quits.What I liked about this film is that it made sure audiences were being entertained. I also think Deadpool's motivation was well established. Wolverine appears via the multiverse, which plays heavily into the plot. Deadpool apologises for the MCU overusing the multi-universe trope. Hugh Jackman no doubt is married to the Wolverine persona. His presence on screen brings more gravitas to the proceedings, even in the goofy world of Deadpool. But that is also because Deadpool gets a little more serious in this outing, and the gags a little less frequent.There was a lot to like with the established characters from other movies and tv series being intertwined. I don't read comics, and people like me are required to pay extra close attention to the exposition. For the real fanboys, this movie is like a checklist of favourite comic moments (evidently). These moments provide a fresh new plot point, continuing the momentum. During the quiet points, Jackman has a chance to emote probably more than any other Wolverine film. It works, and helps to tie in the multiverse premise. I can't say the same for the Wade Wilson character. I guess it has been that long that I kind of lost track of some of his demons. But also since he wears a mask that completely covers his face for a good portion of this film, it is hard to delve into them, at least with any real depth.The third act felt a little formulaic, something that has been plaguing Marvel movies of late (like the over-the-top CGI in the third act of Black Widow). Not that it was really a letdown, but just very familiar beats. I liked the energy and attitude of this Marvel outing, as the superhero burnout phenomena continues. The six year gap since the last Deadpool helped in this case, along with a bravura performance by Hugh Jackman.Despite the superlatives I give for this franchise, I still only give this film a 6 out of 10. Just a little above average. I reserve higher ratings for films that really stand out. I give a lot of films 6 stars in which there is competent filmmaking, and a watchable story. But they normally don't transcend the genre and fall into a well established formula.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
577,9.0,7-Aug-24,"This was such a disappointment. I went to the cinema filled with excitement and having already read so many dithyrambic reviews, I expected to watch something good, to experience Marvel's cinematic rebirth everyone is so eagerly talking about. But no. The film has so many fundamental problems, I don't really know where to start from.The movie's most important problem is it's plot, if there is one actually. The multiversal, time travel thing doesn't really work here. As the movie progresses, it becomes so evident that the work made in the creating of the plot was just lazy.The directing is at most mediocre. Every single action scene is badly shooted and it leaves an indifferent feeling to the viewer. The settings are empty, which is an indicator of the budget's (approx. 200m dollars) mismanagement. During the movie Deadpool makes a joke about the setting looking Mad-Max-like, but it is actually much worse( I mean Mad-Max movies are a spectacle, this was so far off that)If someone read this review they would think: Alright, this movie is plotless and badly directed but it surely makes the viewer laugh their guts out, it's a Deadpool movie! I afraid this isn't the case. The film was not even half as funny as the previous two. The jokes it makes are dated and repeated.I don't really know what comes after this. This was definitely not a Marvel rebirth or something like that. The film is just...lazy. But it makes sense people loved it so much because they had the previous recent Marvel movies as a reference.And concluding this review I just have one question to ask: Marvel, is this all you can do?","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
578,1.0,15-Aug-24,"Directed by Tim Miller and starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular character, Deadpool was a breath of fresh air in a genre that was beginning to feel formulaic. The film's success was largely due to its willingness to break the fourth wall, its R-rated humor, and its self-awareness. Ryan Reynolds, who had been attached to the character of Deadpool for years, finally got the chance to do justice to the ""Merc with a Mouth,"" and he delivered in spades.Reynolds' performance is the heart and soul of Deadpool. He effortlessly blends sarcasm, wit, and vulnerability, making Deadpool one of the most memorable characters in the superhero pantheon. The film's plot is relatively straightforward, focusing on Wade Wilson's quest for revenge after being subjected to a rogue experiment that leaves him with accelerated healing powers but a disfigured appearance. What sets Deadpool apart, however, is its tone. The film revels in its irreverence, poking fun at superhero tropes, the X-Men franchise, and even Reynolds' own career missteps.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

580,8.0,26-Jul-24,"To say this movie is a wild ride would be an understatement. Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on every front-laughs, action, visual effects, and heartfelt nostalgia. From the moment the film starts, it's clear that Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman had an absolute blast, and their chemistry is off the charts.This film is a love letter to fans, jam-packed with cameos that surpass even our wildest expectations. The appearances of Henry Cavill and Chris Evans are particularly delightful, and the hint at Loki and a potential Avengers team-up leaves the door wide open for future MCU excitement.The action is gory and satisfying, pushing the boundaries of what we've seen from Disney. The plot, while heavily reliant on fan service and cameos, is still a fun and emotional journey. The introduction of Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova adds a refreshing dynamic, bringing a mix of humor and menace.However, the film isn't without its flaws. Some scenes feel overly parodied, and the CGI can be hit or miss. There's also a sense of aimlessness at times, as if the movie is more about the spectacle than the story. Additionally, certain pop culture references may fly over the heads of casual viewers.Despite these minor quibbles, Deadpool & Wolverine is an absolute blast and a must-see for any Marvel fan. It's a zany, nostalgic joyride that promises to reignite your love for the MCU.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

583,6.0,27-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is an excellent Marvel movie that fits in not only the grand scheme of the MCU, and the Fox franchise, its also just a great buddy comedy.The most relieving factors are its well-deserved R rating, and the fact that you only really need a general idea of Marvel to get the movie. You don't need to watch the entirety of the mountain of movies in the franchises that this coincides with, and the gore and vulgarity are comfortably on par with the previous Deadpool films. The jokes are refreshingly, unabashedly, and unashamedly hilarious, the action is exciting and amazingly-choreographed, and the aesthetic of the film feels right out of a comic book. There are incredibly lively costumes, props, and settings, all done in a way that makes you think, ""how wasn't something done like this sooner?"", and elevated by a colourful cast of characters each portrayed in brilliant fashion. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman share boundless chemistry with countless quips and ooze charisma. The supporting cast were all great, with a stand-out being Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, who's able to be entertainingly terrifying.There's one particular action scene that distractingly uses shakey-cam and because of that it stands out like a sore thumb in a movie that's full of great action scenes that don't use it at all. Lining up the continuity and crossing over the two franchises results in an imperfect mix of established universe laws, such as the time travel mechanics in Deadpool 2 now contradicting the mechanics of Avengers: Endgame, making some aspects distracting for hardcore fans. Also, the antagonist is the film's weakest link, and the pacing can be unbalanced at times too.However, all of that is only really noticeable from a critical point of view and, in reality, the real effectiveness of a comedy comes from its humour, and this film has it in spades. Overall, A fantastic Marvel film, a great superhero film, and a fun film in general.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
584,1.0,4-Aug-24,"Deadpool 3 is nothing more but pure entertaining fun. It is low on calories or relevance but it´s been a while since I had fun or even rated a Marvel movie high. This is a movie that can feel almost nonsensical to make without much purpose in the overall presentation, since it feels like it wants to be a Marvel extravaganza but ends up being just another Deadpool movie in its own little world and continuity. I hope this movie isn´t in the Marvel canon since that would have some bad implications for the future of the already crumbling Marvel cinematic universe, but is what it is a harmless entertaining dictation.With the thread of his universe being destroyed, Deadpool is forced to find a replacement for his Wolverine, this leads to a fight between them, the multiverse police and the fate of the Fox legacy.First off, this movie is interesting in its approach to Disney/Marvel acquiring the Fox licences back. The fate of the Fox license are still in a weird echo chamber to me, since this movie aloes to the Fox movies and the overall death of Fox, but at the same time celebrates and shows what Fox did to these licences, good and bad. You have probably head of a lot of cameos in this movie, yes go in blind to have the most fun. But after a movie like this that feels like it´s in its own separate universe away from the Marvel canon, I actually don´t see the point as to even bring it up, other than to make jokes and really hit home, yes this is Disney now. The credits even has a salute to the former Fox era of Marvel movies and I must say, it brings this sour taste in your mouth with Disney now holding licences like X-men and many more, and it´s going to be interesting what the future will bring.Speaking of the humour I felt the joke ratio was good and this movie got a lot of laughs out of me. The meta humour works and the movie gets away worth way more than I thought it would, but at the same time that should have been predictable, since we all predicted we would get a muttered Deadpool under Disney. But I laughed a lot here and this is carried by Ryan Reynolds performance that definitely is a huge carrying factor of this movie and the Deadpool franchise as a whole. There is a lot of great and fun performances here and Hugh Jackman also delivers a string and emotional performance, when he is given the mic. I feel like Deadpool is the one holding it the most and that can make Wolverine feel a bit absent at times in a movie bearing his name.This is a movie for the fans of Deadpool, Fox and Marvel, not much more. This movie is really light on plot and relevance, but can´t you say that of most modern comedies? That is of course not an excuse, but to really set your expectations as to what you are watching will help you enjoy the movie more. This is not the next movie in the Marvel pantheon, hopefully, this is just another Deadpool comedy movie and in that regard it delivers.There is some fun ideas in terms of action and in general the action feels good here. The fights between characters are fun and having Deadpool and Wolverine duking it out, two nearly immortal beings really lowers the stakes but set up for fun things to do where blood can fly freely. This movie added a lot of blood and from the amazing opening that you no doubt got spoiled if you are on TikTok, the action is set to be fun and the final fighting extravaganza is so well done. The action is filmed sloppy most of the time though with too many cuts and some really poor CG is present most of the movie. The shot of our two heroes jumping out of a bus looks absolutely atrocious.This movie uses music a lot and there are some fun and memorable needle drops here. They are sometimes annoyingly interrupted for no reason and the move has a bit too much licensed music for my liking. Tarantino really ruined using songs in film, while he knows how to do it, he created an annoying trend that most directors don´t know how to do right. Again this movie is mixed with its music use, but mostly it´s entertain9ng and well done.Deadpool 3 is a mixed bag in terms of what it is and what to get out of it. Am I enjoying myself and laughing? Yes, is this an epic Marvel movie? Not really does it have heart, purpose or characters? Debateable, but I am stuck thinking, this was fun, entertaining and normally comedies have a hard time getting to me, so I can only applaud when a movie is successful of that.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Not sure, but it wasn't really 'there'.It started well. Irreverent, the usual deadpool fare. The story was stupid, but it was more a vehicle for the action and jokes. Jackman did a great job of playing wolverine completely straight, and I only got a hint of the actor trying not to laugh as he delivered a hard and emotionally loaded line.But the third act. It was actual trash. For all the in-movie mocking of Fox and Disney, it was clear that Disney cannot be denied, as we finished with the most schmaltzy and family friendly ending. I'm surprised they didn't throw in christmas as icing on the cake.The 'romantic' thread of the story was utterly out of sync with the first two movies, to the extent that I got confused about timelines and multiverses, and fully expected us to run into mainline deadpool for at least half the movie, until the yawn inducing plot settled in. A failure of the writers to do anything interesting with their premise, other than take cheap shots.The movie is designed to hit the 'memberberries, and it does so ruthlessly.

595,6.0,9-Aug-24,"In recent years it's become a trend to hate on marvel and the films they've put out of late and I have to admit to jumping on that bandwagon. I've had a think about what it really is about marvel that I've come to dislike and I've come to the conclusion it's how insanely popular their movies became. So popular in fact that it got to a point that Marvel properties were the only films bringing in the big bucks at the box office. So much so that cinemas seemed inundated with superhero films and little else.More recently however they've experienced a fall from grace as often things do after a prolonged period of such success. There's been a marked drop in the quality of the films and series they've been putting out with their focus seemingly on quantity rather than quality.With all that being said there's something about Ryan Reynolds in that tight red suit that's captured the hearts of film goers.This third Deadpool film has been on a lot of people's most anticipated films of the year list despite the overall excitement for new marvel releases having been low of late.Now I really enjoyed the previous two Deadpool films but I have to say that for me this was the weakest of the three.Despite all the marketing and even the title of this film focusing on the addition of Wolverine, make no mistake this is very much a Deadpool film.Logan in my opinion was a perfect end to Jackman's tenure as the clawed crusader and if I'm honest outside of marketing it felt somewhat unnecessary for him to reprise the role.He's in most of the film but the reason for him being there in terms of plot progression seemed lacking and other than lost marketing and fan service this film wouldn't have been much different without him.I don't think it brings down Jackman's X-Men and Wolverine films in any way but it just feels unnecessary, even if it's a paring that will in no doubt be loved amongst the marvel faithful.Perhaps the biggest issue I had with this film was Deadpool entering into the MCU and how that plays out. To avoid spoilers I'll just say that the TVA are involved and when you start messing about with timelines it often makes things confusing and not in an enjoyable way like in Inception.Being that Fox is now owned by Disney this may not have been a choice that the creatives behind the film had any control over. It no doubt meant that the budget was bigger but the stakes felt far smaller and it felt like the narrative was an afterthought to Deadpool and Wolverines relationship.After seeing the film I feel that Deadpool would have been better off staying out of the MCU.On a more positive note Ryan Reynolds is on fine form as the quick witted merc with a mouth and I can't help but appreciate how much effort he put into leaki... I mean getting these films made.He's created a character that's become so beloved it was enough to bring Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine which in itself speaks volumes. He's like a joke machine gun constantly blasting the audience with both surface level humour and deep cut references that only a handful of people will get. I don't know if it's just because it's the third film and maybe the shine is starting to wear off but I found the humour a little overbearing at times to the point where it made the more serious scenes harder to appreciate.The action is as slick and gory as ever and there's a number of cameos that Marvel super fans will surely lap up.Overall this film is pretty much exactly what I imagined a Disney owned Deadpool film might look like.A big budget blockbuster that feels somewhat estranged from its routes.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
596,2.0,26-Jul-24,"(Currently halfway to listening Led Zeppelin's ""Presence"" album... p.s. It's not good...)Well, this blew my expectations out of the water and raised the bar miles higher than any other recent project the MCU has done. We're talking about OG Marvel being back. A movie that -call me crazy but- looks at Infinity War and Endgame straight in the eyes and doesn't even blink.A laugh-fest, so packed with cameos that you can't take your eyes off the screen. A complete genius of a movie, with the most masterfully elegant meta humor. The barrier between the movie and the audience is thinner than ever, with an almost non-existent 4th wall. The dialog is SO clever and the jokes are hilarious. I seriously couldn't stop laughing the whole time. The combination of irony, sarcasm, dirty jokes and the complete roasting of the farce that Marvel has been lately, was constantly making laugh uncontrollably.The plot although, is kinda weak. The movie is too based on the nostalgia/cameos factor, that forgets to focus on its own premise. It is weaker than the original for sure, without being pointless. It just kinda feels like a shiny wrapping paper, hiding a mediocre and kind of anti-climactic gift under it. The idea to involve Deadpool with the TVA was unique and understandably, was the only way to bring back the returning characters. By doing so though, they create lots of questions regarding the way these characters ended up in the ""void""; questions that are possibly already answered in the original comic-books... idk.The basic plot though, is interesting but doesn't add much to the lore, with the inevitable redemption of Wolverine falling kinda flat, perfectly capturing the essence of the macguffin. An object essential to the plot and the story, but kinda unnecessary itself. The story of a variant of Logan, objectively isn't as important even if emotionally charging, but plays a significant role to Deadpool's happy ending.Lastly, the action was PEAK! Long fights and complex choreography elevated every scene and added a taste of the glory, that the MCU of the past used to be. You could feel the intense battle scenes near you, with the blood curdling everywhere in a sadistic -yet satisfying- scenery. The idea of the two of them being essentially invincible, made me enjoy the fights a lot more knowing each stabbing was like a mosquito bite to them. But tbh, I really wished they had added the ""FATALITY""/ ""BRUTALITY"" effect in some extently gruesome scenes, in a mortal kombat fashion.The over-all feeling I got, was the one of exhilaration. I know that in due time, the flaws will be more noticeable, but at the moment, I feel overly satisfied with the gift that was this movie. I can say I'm regenerated after the embarrassment that Marvel was lately. But yet again, they just brought back the names they knew were gonna hit the hardest. But even so, Shawn Levy did it phenomenally!(By the time I finished writing this, the album's over. I'm now listening to Ozzy's ""Bark at the Moon""... it's very good!)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
597,1.0,12-Aug-24,"I saw this after hearing many of my friends proclaim how hilarious and exciting the movie was. No one was outright laughing from any scene in the theater and my wife and I snickered a few times is all.I did enjoy the multiple fight/ arguments between Logan and Wade, but it took awhile for the movie to get itself going.The cameos were fun adds, and a few Easter eggs for the comic nerd in me, but that aside the movie fell hard from what I expected from the exuberance of my friends and others who already saw the film.Movie is enjoyable, but the gratuitous violence, language and subject matter tarnishes the film overall.It just falls flat and feels forced for the most part, not as witty as first film.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
598,9.0,25-Aug-24,"Based on the provided screenshot, here's Despite what the title suggests, ""Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)"" isn't actually about these two characters. Instead, it is more of a meta-commentary on the film industry, focusing on 21st Century Fox, Disney, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film centers more on Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds as themselves rather than as Wolverine and Deadpool, respectively. Their performances don't feel like genuine character portrayals but rather extended cameos, in a movie already saturated with forced guest appearances.The film heavily relies on breaking the fourth wall, with numerous snide asides, which quickly loses its novelty. This constant self-referencing disrupts immersion, giving viewers the idea they're watching a movie that's more about other movies than its own story. While fourth-wall breaks were a clever and surprising touch in earlier films, their overuse here becomes tiresome and repetitive.The plot lacks engagement, and the action sequences are just as dull. The central conflict-a prolonged fight between two essentially indestructible characters-feels meaningless because there's nothing at stake. Without any real danger or consequence, the audience is left questioning why they should care or even why should you even consider not walking out of the movie theater asking for a refund.Overall disappointment with its shallow plot and overused WOKE gimmicks, making for a rather boring viewing experience.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

603,7.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is an electrifying theater experience. It's hilarious and it's got some great action to keep audiences distracted from an otherwise nonsensical story.As expected, Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds make a great duo. Wolverine's grouchy persona is a great foil to Deadpool's constant jokes and fourth wall breaks. They are also an excellent pair during action scenes, delivering all of the bloody violence that comic book fans expect. The camera work during the action sequences was very creative with some long trucking shots, slo-mo, and dynamic movements.The comedic side of this film was hilarious. There are a lot of jokes for everyone: dirty jokes, deep-cut comic book references, and meta fourth wall breaks. The claws were definitely left unsheathed with that R-rating as these jokes target pretty much everything from the characters to movie studios and filmmaking.On the drama side, Hugh Jackman pretty much carries the entire emotional weight of the film on his shoulders. He's a fantastic actor and is able to ground a lot of the comic book ridiculousness in human emotions.The story on the other hand is pretty much non-existent. Moving at a brisk pace, the film goes from a to b and then it ends. Scenes don't naturally flow into the next. Also, much of the exposition and backstory isn't shown or even alluded to. The film just spoon-feeds the audience with exposition dumping dialogue, something that is addressed by fourth wall breaking jokes. But, this self awareness doesn't fix the problem it just informs audiences that the filmmakers know of issues that they won't fix either due to budgeting or just laziness.The cinematography is quite bland due to flat lighting. The CGI integrated during these shots isn't necessarily low quality but it is very apparent. There are also a few action scenes with some pretty rubbery character models.Overall, though it lacks in the story department, Deadpool and Wolverine is a fun action comedy that will please keen-eyed fans and general audiences looking for a good time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
604,8.0,27-Jul-24,"I am happy to say that Deadpool and Wolverine stands out as being one of the great post Endgame MCU films (although that's not saying much now, is it?).Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman gave excellent performances, and worked very well together as the titular duo.As this is the first R-rated film in the MCU, it delivers enough blood filled action to keep fans of the first 2 Deadpool films happy. It is also very funny, thanks mostly to Deadpool's fourth wall breaking one liners, and his bromance with Wolverine. Also can't forget the killer soundtrack!It isn't perfect, well is anything really? I did feel the film a bit predictable, and had a weak villain, but for the most part it was a fun time at the cinema, and a step in the right direction for the future of the MCU.8/10 - Great.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
605,7.0,27-Jul-24,"As a fan of Wolverine and Deadpool in my 50s, I've been reading comics since my teenage years. I love these characters so much that I would rate even the less popular Wolverine films an 8 out of 10. I even bought a Sony PlayStation just to play Deadpool, as it wasn't available elsewhere.This film, although not as soap-like and unserious as the recent Star Wars productions, still falls into the same category. Don't get me wrong, Deadpool has always been surreal, but behind the comedy lies a genuine seriousness. We've seen at least ten Marvel films where time travel is used to move things around, turning all characters into a soup of confusion. If this wasn't the plot, would I still enjoy watching it? Yes. Would I watch it? Yes.Giving this film an 8 when Logan's average is 8 can only be attributed to being part of Generation Z. If The Wolverine averages a 6, this should be rated lower. Watch it and forget it. In fact, forget it so much that you might wish you had Wolverine's or Deadpool's healing powers to erase it from your memory. Like Wolverine, forget your past.This film is on par with the Suicide Squad sequel. There's nowhere left to go with this mindset. While not as desperate as Star Wars, they're heading in that direction if they push further. As the saying goes, if you push too hard, you'll mess up. With this kind of forced creativity, making a proper film becomes impossible. It's a fun movie, but unfortunately, the script doesn't do justice to the heroes in the title. What else could be expected with such a script? There's no point in criticizing other aspects. Even the disjointed and irrelevant film music is frustrating. It's like the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Paris-each element is above average, but they've been combined in such a way that it feels like a mishmash of hot and cold, sweet and salty. It left a strange taste in my mouth.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Ryan Reynolds brings his signature wit and charm to the role of Deadpool, effortlessly conveying the Merc with a Mouth's irreverent humor and vulnerability. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, bringing his trademark intensity and depth to the character. The chemistry between these two beloved anti-heroes is undeniable, and their banter is some of the funniest I've seen on screen.The intro sequence is one of the best I've seen for a while, quite bloody and funny at the same time.What truly sets this film apart, however, is its willingness to push boundaries and subvert expectations.

If that's your thing, you will thoroughly enjoy it.We got so much action, so much gore and graphical violence that's almost refreshing and truly entertaining!But there was no real story with stakes, tension or a clear villain even. It feels like the characters fight anyone they can once a small reason arises. There are no stakes, nothing can really die or be destroyed, so none of the action grips you. All except for wolverines Miley foreseeable character arch.It feels like watching a comedy show most of the time, not an action film.

615,6.0,29-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine Review (NO SPOILERS)Disney promised to respect Logan movie and its perfect conclusion to Wolverine's story, and of course, they didnt do that, instead they literally desecrate it in the first 2 minutes of this film.There is a good analogy that Max Landis drew with what happened in the world of American Wrestling when WWF bought WCW and forced all their wrestlers to constantly lose and be embarrassed. The same treatment is felt here with Disney's attitude towards Fox and their characters. Most of those cameo characters are not only nerfed, but mostly serve for mockery and only to invoke nostalgia and then be put aside and forgotten.The acting in the movie is generally good and easily the best part. Emma Corrin was such pleasant surprise with her acting and passion, even the character was for the most parts interesting. Hugh Jackman of course shines again and gives his best, even though his character is not as well-written as in Logan. His chemistry with Reynolds easily carries the whole movie.Reynolds is Reynolds, for some reason, he shows his face almost in every scene. Also, if I'm not mistaken, Deadpools faces is not as ugly as in the previous parts.The direction isn't bad , there are some nice shots and camera movements but the pacing and editing could have been better. The scenes jump too quickly to reach next joke or action, not giving enough time to connect with the events and characters in the story. Those jokes do feel a bit forced and cringy, mostly relying on mockery while even repeating some old jokes from previous ones. The action on the other hand is actually quite good and fun to watch, although it suffers a bit from The Last Jedi choreography syndrome, where we see villains swinging and hitting the air, waiting for their turn to be struck by main characters.As for the story itself, the basis is serviceable , but with some flaws, mistakes and naivety, I've always advocated that the main villains shouldn't always be defeated just by heroes punching them until they fall and its welcome here but the issue is that it felt way too rushed and anticlimatic. They've aslo copied the same idea from an older MCU film.The biggest problem of the movie is its characterization. Both Deadpool and Wolverine suffer from some heavy flanderization. Although the writers tried to fill them with some emotional depth, it is immediately choked by forced humor, fan service and action in almost every scene. Only true emotion ends up being evoked by nostalgia can evoke and some of the musical sequences (of which there may be too many) remain. I would especially point out one of the villains who is terribly written and poses no threat or danger to the main characters; in fact, none of the villains are the threat except Cassandra Nova. She is perhaps the most interesting character and also the most powerful mutant we've seen (and maybe even the most powerful villain in the entire MCU).Another thing to mention they announced that this film doesn't require watching/knowing anything from before, but that's not entirely the case. Although I believe people won't have much trouble following the story, it still relies a lot on elements that not everyone will fully understand and catch unless they seen some previous shows and movies, especially the cameos and fan service.Talking about them, movie is almost everything fans wanted Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness to be. Unfortunately, Marvel returns to the formula where fans know exactly what they're watching by spoiling all the important parts through the trailers, making this a very predictable film.Overall, the movie on itself is fun and entertaining, but far beyond the league of first Deadpool and Logan. If you have no problem turning off your brain and watch another typical MCU comedy, full of action and fanservice, only now with the addition of an R-Rating, you'll enjoy it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

""Deadpool & Wolverine"" isn't just bad-it's an insult to the very concept of entertainment.From the moment this travesty begins, it's clear we're in for a torturous ride through the bloated, decaying corpse of what was once a promising franchise. The plot, if you can call it that, is a nonsensical mishmash of multiverse garbage that even a lobotomized chimp would find confusing. It's as if the writers threw darts at a board of comic book clichés and decided to string them together with the weakest of threads.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, two talented actors reduced to caricatures of themselves, sleepwalk through their roles with all the enthusiasm of DMV employees on a Monday morning. Their once-witty banter now feels forced and cringe-worthy, like listening to your drunk uncle try to be ""hip"" at Thanksgiving dinner.The action scenes are a nauseating blur of CGI vomit, each one more pointless than the last. Watching two immortal beings duke it out has all the stakes and excitement of watching paint dry in slow motion. It's a testament to the film's awfulness that I found myself envying my father, who had the good sense to fall asleep-twice!-during this cinematic root canal.But wait, there's more! The movie shamelessly panders to the lowest common denominator with a parade of pointless cameos and references. It's as if the studio execs said, ""Quick! Throw in every D-list Marvel character we own the rights to! The fanboys will eat it up!"" Newsflash: Nostalgia isn't a substitute for good storytelling.The attempts at humor are about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. For every joke that lands (and I'm being generous-there are maybe two), there are a dozen that fall flatter than the Earth in a Flat Earther convention. The constant fourth-wall breaking isn't clever; it's a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there's no actual substance to this movie.In conclusion, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a soulless, cash-grabbing monstrosity that represents everything wrong with modern blockbuster filmmaking. It's a cynical exercise in fan manipulation that mistakes references for relevance and quips for quality. Save your money, save your time, and for the love of all that is holy, save your brain cells.

With Deadpool entering the MCU and Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, the anticipation and expectations were high. This was their shot at revival...and they DID NOT disappoint!Deadpool and Wolverine is a spectacle carried by the amazing dynamic between its two titular characters. An R rated roller coaster, full of quips, cameos, carnage and enough fan service to put a smile on anyone's face. DIsney let Deadpool, be...Deadpool uncensored and unapologetic. His dynamic with Wolverine carries the entire movie, having your eyes glued to the screen during the entire runtime.The movie is also a love letter and a tribute to the Fox era of superhero films. From the artistic opening scene, to the nostalgic end credits the movie honors the legacy of the characters that they have acquired and bids most of them farewell.The only real criticisms I have involve the plot of the film itself. It's pretty thin but also kind of confusing.

625,7.0,30-Jul-24,"I enjoyed DP3 as it had great action scenes and bromantic synergy between the title characters. That's expected. The first depiction of Cassandra Cain in live-action was also solid. But felt like there was a little too much forced humor and fan service that took away from the movie to make me want to love it as much as I do the other ones. This movie was a last hoorah for those that enjoyed the Fox movies and pre-MCU films. I think it was good up until the third act where it felt too predictable. This movie is definitely marketed well and overhyped in my opinion. It may rank in the top 10 MCU movies but definitely not in my top 5. A lot of reviews are saying it's as good as Endgame and that's totally false. Spider-Man: No Way Home, in my opinion, is the only movie after that has come closest. Although that one doesn't go without its faults, there was much more of gravitas and impact, not just with Peter but with the audience in depicting so many emotional scenes in regard to Peter holding Aunt May while she dies, Uncle Ben conversation, Garfield's Spidey saving MJ, Holland visiting the coffee shop post-memory wipe, Maguire nearly preventing Holland from killing Green Goblin. Just didn't feel as much of that in DP3.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

627,9.0,10-Aug-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine feels like they're acting. Not that they're actors acting like the characters they're portraying. No, more like Hugh and Ryan acting like themselves pretending to be Wolverine and Deadpool, respectively. Based on that, I couldn't take it seriousously. Not that Deadpool is meant to be taken seriously. Most of the best parts were shown in the preview clips, but, sadly, not in the movie. Again, Hugh and Ryan just messing around. It's fun, because you can't take it seriously when the actors don't. Also, I didn't get why Deadpool wasn't bothered about all the ""bad guys"" he killed, but was terrified he'd caused a death of a superhero (not saying anymore), but do stick around for the trailer after the credits. It was great to see old, unwanted, superheroes and where they were banished to, but no resolved ending which was disappointing. I think we will find out in the next one that this entire movie was a Deadpool coke-induced dream from start to finish. This is based on a single, one-second scene in Wade's apartment toward the end. I think that's why this whole movie feels like Hugh and Ryan just messing around. I know it's a movie, but it just doesn't feel real.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The film cleverly balances its chaotic storyline with sharp, witty dialogue and over-the-top action sequences. Reynolds' performance remains the heart of the series, effortlessly blending comedy, charisma, and surprising moments of vulnerability.One of the standout features of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is its meta-humor, which is more pointed and self-aware than ever. The film doesn't shy away from poking fun at itself, the superhero genre, and even its own place within the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. This self-referential approach, combined with creative and unexpected plot twists, keeps the audience engaged and entertained throughout.The action scenes are as inventive and energetic as fans have come to expect, with a mix of practical effects and CGI that delivers a visually stimulating experience. The film's R-rating is well-utilized, allowing for the signature blend of graphic violence and adult humor that sets ""Deadpool"" apart from other superhero films.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

In Multiverse movies MCU only does cameos of variants is usually and it is also teased by Deadpool explicitly. They made goosebumps in cameos but one thing is they wasted Chris evans cameo useless.

631,6.0,26-Jul-24,"Full on Wolverine nerd here. I have the first 93 Wolverine comics in sequence and many others. (He says with a lisp while pushing up his glasses.). As good as the X-men movies have been, (mostly) we finally get to see just how dangerous he is. ""Logan"" was exceptional but he was a broken man who had lost hope. Hope is what he fights for in this and it is raw and visceral. Be afraid of the Wolverine...be very afraid. Hugh Jackman is so good at making the audience feel the heart of this movie. The nice guy in him really bleeds through every role he takes. Future legendary actor on display once again.Ahh... Deadpool. Your mouth just cannot stay shut can it?! Everyone knows someone similar I suppose, where every thought rolls right of the tounge. Deadpool's butt-kickery is the best it has ever been. Unexpectedly, he really establishes himself as a, dare I say it, leader?!?!I'm shocked to say this but after this one Ryan could actually fill the void left by RDJ and Chris Evans. They will have to bleep him quite a bit for any PG-13 entries but that would be funny in itself trying to interpolate which swear he's using.As for the movie itself, this is the next level of Marvel. You can tell from the first five minutes that Kevin Feige just removed the governor, made everything fair game and told the writers to just have at it. Have at it they did. With so many cameos and nods to the past, this film does for 20th Century Fox what Endgame did for MCU. Endgame was, in part, like walking around in a museum and (finger quotes) marveling at all the movies that brought us there. D & W gives us that for Fox. It is so funny and so touching it will give you all the feels. Watch the movie in a crowded theater, then watch it again to catch all the jokes you missed because everyone is laughing so hard.

635,7.0,11-Sep-24,"I remember when Deadpool (2016) was released, it was literally said that, although it could hardly be called a perfect movie (perhaps due to the genre), it was a movie that definitely has nothing wrong or nothing to criticize. I, personally, give it a perfect 4.5 stars. And although with Deadpool 2 (2018) one could be a little more critical due to many nonsensical things that happen in it, it leaves the same feeling: a good movie without trying to do anything other than entertain you.And we arrive at 2024, a year in which the only hope for Disney and the MCU is that the incorporation of the mouthy mercenary into their universe is a box office success. Unfortunately, it was.I say ""unfortunately"" because, even though the movie was a box office success, I can't help but see everything that is wrong with it. You have Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine together on screen after almost 20 years of wanting it. It's impossible to say you don't have a good time at the cinema: you have fun, you laugh and you enjoy the action scenes, the references and the cameos to the fullest. OMG the cameos! Definitely, the best thing about this movie are the cameos from the FOX saga. But, if you take away the hype that those cameos create, you're left with only excellent protagonists, but without any good or even coherent backstory.Although I'm not quite sure how the film industry works, I like to think that I would be a fan of writers, because, for me, they are the ones who create the stories, the most entertaining part. However, I find it incredible to think that, with so much money invested in movies, a writer cannot make a coherent and simple story that can be incorporated into the universe. This situation was caused by themselves by creating this multiversal mess, and at the same time making a criticism of the production system that is the film industry.I know that the excuse can be that the writer does not follow the universe to the letter or watch all the movies they have made, but then, why does Disney expect us to do so in order to catch all the references they make? Why can't they just give the writers the basis so they can create a story that has the minimum congruence and fits, instead of adding more subthemes, developments and complexities about universes and time travel? Things that we don't need. We are at the stage where the MCU should start to come together, focusing on the ideas presented in all its different movies, and not creating more and complex situations that make no sense for those already described previously in the universe or for the viewers.That's why, while the movie was a box office success and delighted us with the characters and cameos, it was definitely a failure in terms of the story and its connection to the MCU, which, by the way, is not even clear or established as to how the incorporation of the FOX universe will work. At least not for me. In my opinion, that won't happen. Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) felt more like a closure and farewell to the FOX universe than a welcome to the Disney universe.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, delivering both heartfelt moments and laugh-out-loud comedy.The storyline is tightly woven, bringing together elements of the X-Men universe while introducing new characters and surprising plot twists. The film doesn't shy away from its R-rated roots, offering plenty of over-the-top action scenes and witty banter that push the boundaries of the genre.An exciting Easter egg for fans to look out for is a clever nod to the original ""X-Men"" films. During one scene, Deadpool makes a reference to Wolverine's yellow spandex suit from the comics, a playful homage to the character's traditional costume that was never seen in the earlier movies.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a must-watch for fans of the Marvel universe, combining the best elements of both characters into one exhilarating film.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The plot begins when Wade Wilson/Deadpool thinks that his life will never serve any purpose and he ends up in the Time Variance Authority. He thinks he can save his timeline and gain a little importance by going to another reality to snag a replacement version of the anchor being: Wolverine. Things don't go according to plan, and they end up in a wasteland peopled with superbeings who have been banished by a society that got tired of them, overseen by the powerful Cassandra Nova. Reynolds fires off gags at a mile a minute; Jackman delivers an actual character arc that provokes real emotion. Director Shawn Levy has a great sense of tone and keeps things brisk, piercing the film of some self-regarding aspects. Deadpool & Wolverine makes many a strong case for there still being life in this franchise by placing character over Universe.

It didn't necessarily make me enjoy the film any less, I was just surprised and would have liked to have been a little less knowledgeable about what was to come. I will echo a few other reviews that I've read by saying this is the least of the three Deadpool films. It is still terrific, it just doesn't have the same heart as the others. I'm not really sure they were even interested in making it a Deadpool film to be honest. It was more an opportunity for Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman to make a fun movie together, and the audience is treated to going along for the ride. I enjoyed the film immensely, there was just something about it that felt more forced this time. That didn't matter in the end as I still had a blast and will likely go to see it again at least one more time. Like the majority of the recent ""Multiverse"" films, there are plenty of outstanding cameos in the movie and one double fake that was genius. That being said, the fact that the entertainment industry is to the point where they are mocking those storylines, makes me think that the concept is on its way out. Overall, I had a great time with this, and it was worth watching Reynolds' passion project, even if it wasn't the best Deadpool movie ever.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

End of, in particular)!* explanation now deleted in my review, but note Reynold's DP mentions such even directly by name in this installment (only alluded to in previous two: incidentally in connection there, Vanessa, Morena Boccarin, here returned almost in blink and ya miss her BRIEFLY)Or criticism of rather crass aspects that just so happen to bleed (pun intended) over into real life? Seems you'll have to make your own guesses on those allusions.But check = see how 'Nice' Pool's demise and also 'hear' Chris Evans' post credits diatribe against the (baddy) woman;remind you of anything similar in real world?As of whom, fab femme baddy (Emma Corin as a Cassandra) surely couldn't be in describing her frightening mind-f .. = fingering rendition ..? (And so, its associated Star Trek / Spock; latter even specifically stated, references)?Or the calling out of overindulgence in the film backer conglomerates rivalry (etc.) irrelevancies (after one = enough acknowledgement = best 'impacted' into 'the Void' scene ;.-)Or, that, all in all, to share, still, I found it FUN to watch, but, which, yes, much mostly (coincidentally!) de'VOID' (!) of much coherent storytelling / plotting? (Other than another mish mash of superhero-verse of 'we can do it in CGI special efx, so put some sort of story to it ..'?!)Coz so, overall, is it worth seeing (on the big screen)Well, undoubtedly, YUP; sure, it's good (clever);as in particular e.g. With Jackman's titular return in convincingly (Marvel superhero!) world-weary portrayal way, as upholds his gruff, morose character enjoyably (i.e. In lieu of prior well praised - supposed, final - bow-out in 'Logan'); but then comes the raised eyebrow tedium of (re)-introduction of random other comic source characters for no other discernible reason than, 'we can' (and said actors to get a outa retirement recognition paycheck nod?) so to add knowing frisson for those fanboys (and gals) since virtually all are soon ignored, forgotten = mere fodder for the de-rigueur battling scenes; even Logan's prior wonder kid ('Laura / X23', Dafne Keen here) is here returned, yet given virtually no purpose to be / also reinstigated into the franchise.I'll have to leave out the obvious 'bromance' like tussle between the titular heroes being reminiscent of .... (don't mention it by name = too much fanboy shock!): but it occurs in a surely glaring product placement car which has otherwise seemingly zero relevance to being in the 'plot' ..

The movie's biggest flaws are ones that have been hampering the MCU for a while now.The villian/s of the piece are poor and quite irritating. Matthew Macfadyen is the biggest offender with hammy acting even too much for a comic book movie. Any time he's on screen he brings the movie to a screeching halt.The stakes are meaningless, like they have been since the Multiverse got introduced to the MCU. The movie stops to tell you this on more than one occasion and therein lies it's strength.The movie works because of the chemistry between Hugh Jackman & Ryan Reynolds and Marvel knows it. We get multiple battles between the two and they live up to the hype. 85% of the film is just them together and it's all the more glorious for it.The soundtrack has to be acknowledged for pumping out banger after banger.

660,1.0,27-Jul-24,"While I am not particularly much a fan of the superhero genre in general, I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the 2006 ""Deadpool"" and the 2018 ""Deadpool 2"" movies. And of course I was definitely looking forward to getting to watch the 2024 ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" movie.But nothing could really have prepared me for the thrill-ride of an adventure that I was in for here. ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" totally takes the franchise to a whole new level in so many ways, and it was phenomenal entertainment from start to end.Writers Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells and Shawn Levy put together a fast paced, enjoyable and entertaining script and storyline. The narrative in the movie is interesting and compelling from the very first scene. The movie starts out in a high paced gear and actually never slows down, which was a rather impressive feat actually; keeping the pace up for 127 minutes straight.Needless to say that having Ryan Reynolds (as Wade Wilson/Deadpool) and Hugh Jackman (as Logan/Wolverine) together on the screen was just pure gold. It was something that I think a lot of people had been looking forward to for a very long time. And believe you me, it was well worth the wait. They carried the movie so nicely on the screen, with their banter, their clashing of heads, fighting and dialogue. It was actually so much fun to watch them getting to duke it out on the screen, both physically and verbally.In addition to Reynolds and Jackman, then ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" has an impressive cast ensemble, and there are some glorious returns of former Marvel characters, which I assume might be getting rebooted since they are in this movie. It is definitely pure gold for fans of the superhero genre, and for people whom have been watching the older Marvel movies throughout the years.The dialogue in the movie, as it was in ""Deadpool"" and ""Deadpool 2"" is hilarious. Lots of great references, puns, jokes and generally just an allround quirky feel to the movie. It is hilarious, because you get to laugh a lot in between all the action.There is an abundance of over-the-top action throughout the course of the movie, and it looks phenomenal on the screen. The action sequences are so well-choreographed and filmed that it borders on being artistic. I was really impressed with that in the movie, because it added so much to the overall enjoyment of the movie.Visually then the movie is great. The movie is just crammed with an abundance of special effects, and it looks phenomenal. And the costumes and props department also deserves a thumbs up for their creativity and what they managed to bring to the screen.""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is better than the previous two ""Deadpool"" movies, and that is definitely a feat in itself. I was blown away by director Shawn Levy's 2024 movie, and it is well-worth the cinema admission ticket. If you enjoyed the previous ""Deadpool"" movies, then you have to treat yourself this this third movie in the franchise. I will go as far as to actually saying that this is the most enjoyable and impressive superhero-themed movies I have seen to this date.My rating of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" lands on a well-deserved nine out of ten stars.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
661,6.0,25-Jul-24,"I just got out of Deadpool and WolverineFor me, Marvel has been hit and miss since Avengers Endgame, whilst I liked Guardians of The Galaxy 3 and did not hate Thor Love & Thunder, like some. It has not really delivered since 2021's Spiderman: No Way Home.I thought Deadpool and Wolverine would be good. I didn't expect it to be this good. It is hilarious (it's pretty much a straight up comedy) and is very R Rated, with a lot of fun action sequences. The Like A Prayer action sequence is a joy to behold. The movie not only gave me everything I wanted, but everything I didn't know I wanted. Think of it as a Buddy cop movie set in the MCU that is surprisingly emotional at times.Ryan Reynolds always knocks it out of the park as Deadpool, his non stop talking, should get annoying, but it never does, at least for me. When you see how good Hugh Jackman is here, you will want him to stick around in the MCU. I can't see any other actor, stepping into his shoes, so soon after this. If Logan was ""goodbye"", this was ""I'm back"".The cameos are not what you expect at all,but are amazing. Some of them are not even cameos, but actually service the story. They are very satisfying. There is a lot of spot on industry commentary from Reynolds, too. I think comic book readers/fans will get more out of it, as some of the jokes (especially during a montage) went over my head, but got big reactions in my screening.There is almost nothing to complain about (outside of my pet hate in Marvel movies, I'm really looking for something to complain about). Though I'm sure, some will find reasons to.There is a nice, touching BTS playing during the end credits, before an end credit scene.For me, Deadpool & Wolverine has dragged the MCU back on track. This reminded me of the early days of the MCU. My second favourite movie of the year. If this doesn't pull audiences out of superhero fatigue, nothing will. This should have huge rewatchability, so I'm expecting huge repeat business. This is the most fun you will have at the cinema, this year. See it soon, before some of it is ruined for you.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Yes, there were other parts of the story which should have been exciting. Alas, I was tired and did not care as much. My brain was on cruise control.The dialogue was too much for my tired brain. However, some of it was very clever and poked fun at alot of the current political correctness that plagues the world today.The humour was mostly Deadpool. So it depends if you like Ryan Reynolds or not.My key point is do not see this if you are tired. You will most likly miss the fun aspects of this movie and zone out like I did during the dialogue.

665,3.0,14-Sep-24,"No one can question the goal Disney has in becoming the primary juggernaut in Hollywood. While corporations trying to be the top corporation has never been anything new, Disney's rampant desire to exclusively focus on blockbusterw has gotten boring, resulting in the studio cranking out what, in my opinion, lead to some the most formulaic, stale films in recent memory. And while Deadpool & Wolverine thankfully presents a breath of fresh air for the MCU, that air still could have been filtered a bit more instead of fairly littered with the particles of present-day comic book films.Deadpool & Wolverine follows the third outing of Ryan Reynold's iconic Deadpool character, and a brand new introduction of his rendition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reynolds, as usual, immerses himself into his superhero persona, pulling the best out of the Merc with a Mouth (although, his jokes in this film prolong their stay more that in others). Hugh Jackman's version of Wolverine here plays differently than in other films - without spoiling anything, his character holds a unique candle to his original Wolverine and Logan iterations. The two characters teaming up turns out to be everything an audience may want - hilarious, intense, and suprisingly, touching. And with cameos galore (especially the deep cut ones that play like ""fake cameos""), the movie starts in a place that makes it very enjoyable to watch. The issue with the film, though, presents in how basic it eventually becomes. It ends up unravelling into a generic, CGI-filled Marvel film and ultimately presents with a good, but unfulfilled, experience.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

They need to take down Mr Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) a renegade from the Time Variance Authority.As well as the forgotten and malevolent sister of Charles Xavier, Cassandra Nova who likes to get her fingers in your face.With the multiverse and a whole host of unexpected cameos.

671,1.0,24-Aug-24,"This has to be hands down my favorite Wolverine movie so far! He is so perfect in this. As someone who reads the actual comics too,this one is sure a treat. I did not like the first 30 minutes of it though. I thought it was very cringe the first half,that is until Wolverine(Hugh jackman) shows up midway through it,and somehow the film starts to pick itself up from there. This is everything I love about Wolverine and they finally get his character right,even down to the classic yellow costume which I thought the first X-Men film was lacking. I could watch a swearing,heavy drinking Wolvie all night lol Gawd is he so damn fine(hot) in this too. Wow what a perfect body! Hugh is also like the Clint Eastwood of this generation,which is perfect because I always felt a young Clint can pulloff the Logan character. Deadpool on the other hand I didn't care much for. Then again I never liked him much in the comics either. Maybe the only things that bug me are the levels of gore which is too much for my taste(this has to be the most violent superhero movie so far! Thus I wouldn't eat while watching this one.) ,and it seems like it kinda rips off(or makes fun of?) The Flash movie from last year. The showdown with Cassandra Nova was oddly similar to the showdown with General Zod in the Flash. Right down to the mindblowing superhero cameos. The use of alternate timelines also felt similar to the Flash. The thing that really makes this movie is Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) imo. If he wasn't in it,it would really suck...Reason why I avoided the Dark Phoenix film is because Wolverine is not in it. Hugh even throws in a little dramatic acting in this amidst the zany comedy. This maybe the Superman III of X-men movies,but then again Wolverine is quite funny in the comics and does drink alot and say ""Bub"" too..The only thing missing was a cigar but other than that I think I enjoyed this. Alot of things in this movie also that only people who read the comics will understand. Such as the reference to the Uncanny X-men #251 cover art. I might watch it again just for certain scenes. The cameos in it are mindblowing...Alot of Shaun of the Dead vibes from this too,and if you downvote on this review it must mean you got a big stick up yer ass,herp derp.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

675,5.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine had high expectations, delivering a fun, irreverent Deadpool film whilst bringing back a fan favourite character without undermining his death in Logan. And this film certainly delivers from what the trailers promised.The plot makes very little sense and is once again another attempt to explain the multiverse that contradicts what came before it. Logical cause and effect are thrown to the wind in favour of moving from spectacle to spectacle. But this can be forgiven since this is a Deadpool film and thus, logic is basically forgotten. That being said, I would've liked more consistency in the plot and certain beats don't hit as hard as the film probably wants it to.But this film certainly delivers on the buddy adventure of Deadpool and Wolverine. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds prove they are still perfect for these roles. Especially Jackman, playing a different Wolverine and making him distinct from his original self. The two have excellent chemistry on screen and they are involved in the film's funniest moments. There is also an irreverent amount of fan service and at times it certainly feels overdone and bothersome. But there are a lot of surprises that will leave audiences floored. The action is solid and the dialogue and humour is what you would expect from a Deadpool film. Some jokes really hit, others miss.Another issue however is this film feels stuffed. So many characters and moments feel underdeveloped. I would've loved for more time with some of these characters, especially on the villain front. It would have served to heighten the emotional and hysterical impact.Overall though, while it is my least favourite Deadpool film, this film is loads of fun. It fully delivers on its premise and more. It's exactly what one would want for entertainment, funny and irreverent. It may be overstuffed and somewhat underdeveloped, but it's still a fun time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It has no heart at all. Madonna sounds good in a theatre, the choreography is decent, but that's the high point.I quite enjoyed the first Deadpool. I'm not expecting it to be Bergman, but this isn't even Barbie. There is the most meagre character development possible. There's not even much chemistry.

With that being said I would've liked to see a bit more into the Wade and Vanessa plot point as I think it was a bit unexplored.It's a bit over the top as these multiverse films tend to be but I feel like this film does the best job of it so far due to Deadpool's 4th wall breaking antics which compliments the chaos.The montage during the credits was a nice touch.

682,7.0,6-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is a half-heartedly epic film. This film explores themes such as grief, regret, self-discovery, and the multiverse. The story of this film feels a bit weak, because the main topic has been used continuously, but it is covered with several epic and surprising things. The actions shown here are epic and really exciting to watch. The comedy is still Deadpool's typical raunchy, outspoken with lots of breaking the 4th wall moments. The motivation of the villains Cassandra Nova and Mr. Paradox here is also less convincing, their intentions and goals are indeed dangerous, but their motivation is just not enough. When Logan tells what is happening in his world, it seems like something is not being explained on purpose. Some of the cameos that appear are surprising, but some have already been revealed so it's less of a surprise. In terms of pacing, it doesn't really feel like it's 2 hours long, but it doesn't feel rushed either. The cinematography is good but nothing special, using a lot of slow-motion techniques. The production design is all solid, especially in the TVA and The Void. The CGI is clean and neat. The soundtrack selection is good, all the songs are good, and somehow it fits some of the scenes. All the acting is good, the main, supporting, and cameo characters are good. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's chemistry here is really good.

And some other stuff, and plenty of zingers that are plenty easy enough for even your friend who only reads DC.

Of course having the duo together added up for frenzied fight scenes, so for the fans of stuntmen ballet, please enjoy.For me after while two characters who cannot die going at it, feels a little too much like Dungeons and Dragons where your pal Fauntelroy has a character with hit points up the wazoo, and on top of that saving spells just in case. At home on DVR, I might have sped up past those to get more of the jokes, but honestly the biggest laughs landed in the first Deadpool.Like a sucker punch.

691,1.0,28-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is easily one of the most fun movies the MCU has released. It feels less like a movie and more comic or cartoon like. It does things that that other MCU films simply can't do. Not merely breaking the 4th wall but referencing the state of Disney, MCU and the actors personally. It's wild but it works.Hollywood comedy is often a miss for me yet the vast majority of the jokes here work. Deadpool is funny enough on his own but the leads bounce off each other perfectly. The comedy is hilarious but As ever, Wolverine is able to bring an emotional and rugged weight to the film.The action is fantastic. It does things that you wouldn't expect to see in live action movies. Not to mention, it's R rated. Hyper violent and excellently crafted, something that also sets it apart from other MCU movies.There are number of cameos and again it's done in a way that only a Deadpool film can pull off. These cameos carry more weight with those who are aware of Fox and Marvel history despite this, the characters should still work for the wider audience.There were many questions regarding how Wolverine would find his way into the movie. Ultimately, I think I was done in an intriguing and satisfying way despite parts of the 3rd act morphing into what we've seen in other marvel movies. And I have to mention the soundtrack - wacky, hilarious and somehow managing to elevate all scenes.I didn't have the biggest expectations for Deadpool and Wolverine but I enjoyed it much more than I expected too.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I'll rate each and every part of the movie, and finally, I'll share my overall rating for the film.Before we dive into rating each part, I'd like to take a moment to talk about how much I admired the opening scene. It was incredible to see the main actors and crew members being credited, and Deadpool was scene fighting fabulously while also dancing to the song that was playing. In my opinion, this was undoubtedly one of the best openings to any superhero film in Hollywood, and perhaps the best opening to any Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. Impressive!I'd give this movie a 9 out of 10 for its background music and song selection. From the very start, with the iconic ""Bye Bye Bye"" by *NSYNC followed by ""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna, it's a masterpiece. Additionally, I was captivated by how each soundtrack seamlessly integrated into every scene of the film. I loved most soundtracks that were used in this film.The film's storyline didn't really impress me. I can't claim to be the biggest admirer of the film's script sequencing. It appeared to be somewhat basic, which is why I'd rate it a 3 or 4 out of 10. There were no plot twists that made the storyline particularly engaging. One shouldn't expect anything extraordinary from the storyline before watching the film. The script mostly felt disjointed and scattered.The cameos, along with the appropriate screen time for each character and nods to previous Marvel films, were almost flawless! In fact, if I were to delve further into the cameos without revealing any spoilers, I'd say you'd be pleasantly surprised by who appears. For fans of Marvel films, this cameo is particularly special. Apart from that, the other main characters were also given justice in terms of screen time, and it didn't feel like it was unfair if we had more or less screen time for any character in the film. That one cameo is what truly makes me want to rate this film a 9/10 in that category.In terms of acting, all the actors delivered an absolute masterpiece. I'd rate it a perfect 10 out of 10. It was superb work! Personally, and I believe many viewers who watched the film would concur, Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of Deadpool was unparalleled. Indeed, out of all the Deadpool films released so far, his performance in this one stands out as the best, although the other appearances were also quite impressive, of course. I'd also like to give props to the one and only Hugh Jackman for his incredible acting as Wolverine. I believe no other actor can pull off that role better than he can. Moreover, I'd like to take a moment to appreciate how hard he must have worked to attain that mind-blowing physique, being almost 50 years old. The depiction of every emotion was executed perfectly by all actors that fit right in the relevant parts of the film.In terms of CGI and other forms of animation, this film once again receives a perfect 10/10. The budget allocated for the high-quality CGI and other forms of animation in this film was undoubtedly more than sufficient and well worth the investment. Incredible work!In my opinion, Shawn Levy, the film's director, excelled in creating an incredibly captivating movie. I also loved the jokes and humor in the film that made it so goofy, yet entertaining to watch. I think the way Deadpool engages with the audience in this film, even poking fun at some crew members, actors, and the studios producing the film, just stands out from any other Hollywood film. And, who other than the legendary Ryan Reynolds could pull off humor at such great strengths? These days, given how easily people get offended by almost the littlest things, forcing filmmakers to hold back on some of the things they display in the film, it didn't feel as in this movie as they took the risk of being as edgy as they could have been, which also left me pretty impressed. This movie brought back real fun. Thus, in terms of this, I'd like to rate this category of the film a 10 out of 10.Overall, I'd rate this movie a 7/10. While some parts exceeded my expectations, others left me underwhelmed. Nonetheless, it's undeniably one of Marvel's most watchable films, especially considering the recent string of disappointing releases. I encourage everyone, especially before the internet is inundated with spoilers for this film, to watch it if you're a true fan of Deadpool, Wolverine, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole. Trust me, it's worth it!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

696,1.0,27-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine definitely presented a lot of interesting story possibilities as a superhero film but also a lot of ideas that left me sceptical at best. Put that on top of marvels recent inconsistency and the fact that the Deadpool movies thus far haven't really worked for me meant I was very much going in with a lot of nervous anticipation. It's an uneven ride for sure with a lot of execution that didn't always work for me but it's a very enjoyable experience with a lot of wholesome character moments that I wasn't sure it would give me.The humour in these Deadpool movies doesn't always work for me but I have to say I found this film to be pretty hilarious when all was said and done. It feels so self aware in all the right ways when it comes to integrating this character into the MCU. Ryan Reynolds continues to prove that he's perfect in this role and as someone who grew up on the Fox X-Men movies I got such a kick out of seeing Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in this movie. Despite the fact that I have a bit of a tricky relationship with Logan I thought it was the right note to end that character on and I was concerned about the idea of this movie bringing him back. Thankfully my fears were alleviated very early on and I thought the way in which they integrated him into this story was almost perfect. His arc here isn't as strong as I wanted it to be however and really neither is the story.I think that's in large part because of the cameos that everyone is so looking forwarding to seeing in this movie. Don't get me wrong there were plenty that brought out my inner comic fan but I will be honest and say that they did lose their impact on me after a while. It doesn't really feel like they took full advantage of the multiverse concept so very quickly it just felt like a series of flat reveals designed to get applause in a theatre. The villains here are also pretty weak which isn't new for the MCU but I did frustrate me a bit more than usual here. I think it's just because of the great actors playing them who give it their all but it never really felt like the script matched their efforts. With the Cassandra Nova character I actually thought there was an opportunity for a cameo with some real emotional weight but that moment never really came so the character as a whole just felt really underdeveloped.A lot has been made of the fact that this is the MCU's first R-Rated movie and I have to say it had a mixed effect on me. Shawn Levy is a really good director, I've liked both his other movies with Ryan Reynolds, and his style really fits in well with the Deadpool tone. It's as gory as you'd expect with really great action but not really one set piece that stood out to me. I just thought it was kind of childish in how it incorporated all of the profanity and the gore to the point where it just became eye rolling for me. It just felt like they were looking for any excuse to drop an f-bomb and it just felt ridiculous very quickly and like they were just going for shock value. I didn't think this with the first 2 Deadpool movies and with this being new territory for the MCU they've still got a ways to go to perfecting it.Deadpool and Wolverine is an undeniable fun ride with moments that were equal parts satisfying as they were frustrating. The cameos were better inserted than I expected but never as exciting as Levy thought they were. It's exciting to see Jackman as Wolverine one last time (I hope) and I did leave the most excited I've ever been to see where the Deadpool character is going next. For me, it wasn't the return to form for the MCU I was expecting but I'd be lying if I didn't say this provide a lot of moments that reminded me of this universe at its peak. That's something which leaves me with hope that they're slowly but surely heading in the right direction.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

If all the movie is is cussing and violence and 4th wall breaking I'll cry foul.The Deadpool franchise (with in the franchise) relies way to much on shock and attempts at shock. Enough humping jokes, and cgi blood. But I guess that's the formula and they won't change it for me. The 1st movie had some heart to go along with the blood. Can't see need for anything more. Superhero movies are dying if not already dead.

With Deadpool cracking jokes about shifting to Disneyland from Fox Studios about every scene and Wolverine maintaining that serious and violent vibe, this is the perfect movie for all genres, whether it be a musical, romance, comedy, action or gritty. Film could have used a bit bigger budget and Ryan was right when commenting about in the movie a couple times, but as a 14 year old (who is technically not allowed) I absolutely adore this movie.

702,7.0,26-Jul-24,"Genuinely love the characters. I'm still a fan of the MCU. I did enjoy it. I smiled at cameos. I liked the overall way it wrapped up. It just didn't hit the spot for me in the same way as DP1 and DP2. I've been trying to work out why.I think the rumours and hype set expectations too high. Same for the trailers. As I was watching, I wasn't just enjoying and going with the flow in the same way as the previous films. I was wondering what would and wouldn't happen based on expectations. The things that did happen were cool but didn't live up to the wider hype (again - I love the characters), and the things that didn't happen - I'm disappointed by. Rumours could have been controlled a bit more.The puns - some made me chuckle a little, but I don't think I did a proper cracking up laugh through the whole thing. I would have, but the funniest bits for me were given out before the film was released. There was a lot of exposition, and the TVA (I liked Loki) bored me. There were times I just wanted the film to get on with it. It didn't have the same quick pace as the previous films.I think the biggest thing for me is, as much as I loved the characters and cameos in this film (and I like where we ended up), I genuinely missed the characters who were more present in DP1 and DP2. I would have preferred to have them continue to develop more in this film than to have so many cameos. One was missing completely with no explanation. The film also made you think something was coming, but it didn't happen. Perhaps another time.I had planned to go watch it at the cinema again, but I don't feel the need to now. I will watch it again in future though, and it is probably one of those films where I'll enjoy it more next time with reduced expectations.I am grateful for the film and for the fanboy bits, but just feel it missed something the other films had more of.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

706,9.0,1-Oct-24,"As if you didn't know this is the third Deadpool movie which brings back the deceased Wolverine character, post Logan. And that is where this movie loses some of its spark. The fact that dead characters are now able to be brought back to life as well as the multi-verse angle, basically means there is zero at stake anymore in these so called universes. The narrative is an obvious team up against a bad guy/girl and the universe or universes are universally under threat etc etc.While there is action galore the fact nobody really dies or can die means there is little at steak when it comes to the violence. So instead they have to try and make the violence more stylish and in some cases played for laughs. But for some reason the fights seemed quite flat and emotionless. Another problem is the cameos. Sure one or two surprises were there, but for the most part I was thinking who is he/she? How are they relevant and what exactly am I missing. Because this is definitely a comic book nerd movie and unless you are in that demographic you won't get any of these references. Even the song choices this time aren't as good. This film is quite the mess, with too many faces, too many pointless punch ups, no real tension and Ryan's cheeky dialogue is starting to grate. Its an ok superhero movie, but really the bar has dropped since infinity war and that is really where it should have ended. I'm not even sure what ""universe"" this is supposed to be but they should have left Wolverine buried.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
707,8.0,27-Jul-24,"As someone who grew up reading Uncanny X-men, who has been blown away by Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, and who has been unexpectedly enamored with the first two Deadpool movies, I had high hopes for this film.But while packed full of punchy one-liners, amazing costumes, a ton of cameos, and plenty of charisma from Renolds and Jackman, a cohesive story or emotional journey was nowhere to be found.Every character from Wade Wilson's story so far was sidelined for 95% of this movie, as Deadpool and Wolverine wander the existential void and navigate TVA agents from the Loki TV show.Self-referential humor about joining the MCU at its low point and Deadpool's complaints about exhaustion with the multiverse don't save this movie from its Disney TV show quality plot and the sluggish, uninteresting multiverse tedium that has bogged down post-Endgame Marvel.Like Thor: Love and Thunder, and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3, Deadpool and Wolverine takes the momentum of films I've been loving and manages to distort them into a not-quite coherent mess with a lot of great ingredients but no overarching magic.And like those other two films, fans seem to not be nearly as thrown off by it all as I am, posting happy reviews.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The TVA (time-bureaucrats) have survived Loki and are the plot McGuffin that allows Logan to be resurrected and to be now forced into the MCU. Honestly, it's not that important, let's just appreciate the witty script and the non-stop childish humor in this movie.Ryan Reynolds shines again as Deadpool, but Hugh Jackman seems a little lacklustre at times - but the script honestly favours Reynolds, and Wolverine is second-billing as the title suggests, but we don't get the powerful performance we saw in Logan, which was a little disappointing.The film has structural issues, particularly towards the end and some of the fighting montages make you want to just fast-forward a few seconds because the characters are essentially dancing with fake blood and CGI - more ballet than exciting action movie - but there's plenty of clever writing to offset any of the fake-tension that crops up. The dialogue is razor sharp (did i mention the dialogue is great?), and the music hits the spot. The cameos are fun, even if you actually did forget about Electra (who could forget?).All in all, a nice reminder that the MCU still exists, even if its ""phases"" are lying dead and bloodied on the floor. I don't think the franchise can recover from its disastrous past few years, but it was a fun and rare outing to the cinema.

Not to mention the cameos. Just perfection, chef's kiss.What I didn't get so much is an emotional involvement with the story. The expose scenes raced by in a blink and you'll miss it sort of way. So much was going on ALL THE TIME that I stopped caring about the why and the how. Despite seeing ""Loki"" I found the TVA plotline far too elaborate to comprehend in the first view. Which is all both a compliment to the movie's highly economic editors as well as a complaint that the TVA plotline just doesn't make sense to every geek over 40.The soundtrack was the weakest part of the movie. For some reason most of the song drops made me cringe, but not in a good way.That, and Ryan Reynolds breaking the 4th wall every 5 minutes. It was overused and it consequently got old.

There were times that I did laugh. The performance from Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal. He is Deadpool. In fact, all the performances are great. However, Hugh Jackman is the highlight here. They didn't touch the ending for Logan and I'm happy for it. It's great to see him as Wolverine - in a great costume - being the hysterical yet threatening mutant that we all know and love. The chemistry between the two titular characters are chef's kiss. Of course, there are cameos throughout. Yet, they're unexpectedly high-spirited and out of the blue. They do some slick stuff and were smart who they invited back. Sadly, the story lacks focus. It has a lot of heart and does a good job of developing its central characters. At the same time, it's the same old stuff that we see in previous Marvel flicks. Once again, the villain is underwhelming despite a solid performance from Emma Corrin. Some of the humor didn't land for me even if I did laugh a lot. Also, some of the special effects weren't that great. It's still a good film regardless. The movie is a return to form.

Nowadays, more people expect much higher in terms of story, script, and acting along with CGI.Good news is that ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" successfully meets its expectations by utilizing various techniques to not only keep the audiences engaged for the whole movie, but mainly to give them an experience of constant laughs, a mix of unique stories, and fun duo scenes between the two.The movie constantly keeps the audiences bursting out laughing using Deadpool's one-on-one interactions, blatant mockery of real-life references along with stern and serious Wolverine intervening to offset its one-sided jokes from Deadpool.Despite numerous Marvel and other miscellaneous references such as characters, stories, and even songs, they make it not so obscure to those who aren't Marvel savvy. They also do a decent job on expositions so people don't get lost in the middle of the movie. What they do exceptionally well is the timing of witty remarks and inappropriate humours. Some of the key moments are born from these.Finally, the chemistry between Deadpool and Wolverine was fantastic. The fact that they have the complete opposite characteristics and yet they both wield sharp weapons that slash whatever blocks them works like a charm.The only improvement that can be made is the battle scene. While it is still entertaining to watch them jabbing, poking, and tussling, the pattern and mood of some of the battles feel repetitive due to similar music being used as well as the slow motion being incorporated.Regardless, red and yellow fighters show up in the nick of time to the rescue in what seems to be the lowest stage of Marvel franchise.

724,6.0,28-Jul-24,"Deadpool shoots and slices his way into the MCU in a largely fun comic-book film (after a long time, uff!) filled with great set pieces, a fantastic lead duo, one-liners galore, and a barrage of cameos (as expected). Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman were born to play Deadpool and Wolverine, respectively-their yin-yang dynamic is used in marvelous ways (pun intended) throughout. Shawn Levy, who has worked with Ryan and Hugh before (but separately), is able to extract the best out of both, making the 2h 7m run-time almost fly by. A lot of the humor is self-deprecating, fourth-wall-breaking, and taking digs at both Fox and Marvel (especially, for their recent fumbles). When you look back at it, Deadpool & Wolverine is almost like a tribute piece to all those Marvel comic-book films made in the last couple of decades, regardless of who made (or acted in) them.That is also why the film's smaller emotional beats might strike a better chord with millennials. The multiverse concept has REALLY run its course, and I'm only letting it slide because it finally brings this iconic duo together (in better circumstances - yes, I'm looking at you X:Men Origins Wolverine) alongside a few others (not going to spoil them - don't go looking for the IMDB cast list!). Considering that's the case, the plot is kinda messy, even when it offers plenty of holy hell moments. The screenplay also nearly forgets to flesh out its antagonist - Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) - and it does so in a hasty way as if just to have a character for the two dudes to finally take down when they're not fighting each other.There's one set piece that randomly begins inside a car, and the way it was shot, particularly stood out to me. Levy and crew also exhibit inventiveness in bringing characters from other universes and timelines, without making a giant mess of it. Every cameo (or extended cameo) is a delicious cherry atop the humongous cake, and also leaves a lot of room for further exploration - now, Disney BETTER NOT go and make 76 films and 29 TV shows already! This is a crowd-pleaser by all means, and it's gonna rake in a lot of moolah at the box office. It's not the perfect comic-book film; heck, it's not even the best Deadpool flick (the first one STILL takes the cake, for me), but what it is though, is a sumptous FEAST for all those who have grown up on a steady dose of Marvel over the years (except for, well.. the 2020s).","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
725,2.0,31-Jul-24,"Prerequisites: Please watch the Original Deadpool, Deadpool 2 and X-Men Origins: Wolverine as minimum mandatory viewing before seeing this. That will allow for Maximum Effort in enjoying every inside joke and Easter Egg this movie has to offer.Pros: The jokes are fast and furious and the action is hard hitting and iconic. The visuals are stunning and the nostalgia is amped to Level 11 for any fan of the X-Men Comics, or even X-Men 96 Animated Series. The fight sequences are top notch and memorable. The soundtrack is legendary and will create an infinite number of new fans for Madonna & NSYNC. But best of all, the cameos will leave you speechless and on the edge of your seat.Cons: The plot was a little shaky, convoluted and hard to follow at times. (What would you expect when time travel and the TVA are involved?) And this is a plot that will more than likely be cleaned up by HISHE (How it Should Have Ended) on YouTube. I would've also liked to have seen more screen time involving Dopinder, Colossus, NTW, and at least Cable and Domino! (Where'd they go?!) My only other minor gripes are the over-the-top violence and gore (but that's what makes Deadpool). And the end credits seemed like a missed opportunity to spring board for any upcoming Avengers projects.Summary: Absolute Must See of 2024. A superb stand-a-lone movie masterpiece on par with the other Deadpool movies and a great swan-song and (if need be) curtain call for Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. (Unless Ryan is right about using him until he's 90, lol!)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Indeed it was a little less disappointing than the others but not what I was looking for... Yes it was funny. Yes it was fun. But enough is enough.At this point I just want a Marvel movie that is serious! Similar to the older ones, with a focus on the plot and just some humor in it, rather than just humor with a minimal amount of plot.I'm sorry but I am no longer 16 and it's starting to bore.Maybe for others it will he good enough but me and Marvel are done.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
727,1.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is a mildly enjoyable mess. To try to understand why, this review will be a comparison between MCU Deadpool and the previous two amazing Fox Deadpool movies.I expected the biggest difference to be with the violence and vulgarity. Even with an R-rating, I didn't expect Disney to allow it to go all out. Luckily that's not the case. We see violence in abundance, along with crass humor and dirty jokes. The comedy comes closest to its predecessors, cracking me up multiple times. But there are several comedic attempts that don't work.The biggest difference is the story, or lack of one. It's a huge mess, more like a series of fun skits than a coherent narrative. There are a couple awesome action scenes that stand out amongst some bland ones. And while we do see some characters from the previous ones, they are barely in it, which contributes to it not feeling the same.While the first two are primarily comedies, when they get serious, you feel it. When they get emotional, you cry. And then with tears still in your eyes, you laugh. The contrast between funny and emotional is masterful. I didn't feel the serious/emotional side nearly as much in this one.Lastly, while the cameos are fun, they are not likely something that will stand the test of time. I enjoyed them, but they do feel a bit gimmicky. Also, the villain isn't as good.As a long time MCU fan, I don't think Deadpool saved it.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 7/25/2024)","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
728,8.0,15-Aug-24,"When Deadpool & Wolverine (D&W) was first announced, I was excited. This was soon followed by trepidation that the film would ruin the sensational and emotional rollercoaster that is Logan.I needn't have worried.What I found with D&W was a film breathing new life in to the Marvel franchise. Since Avengers: Endgame there have been a lot of poor quality Marvel exploits and finally here is a great addition that sits up there with the likes of Thor: Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy.As much as I would love to review the content of the film, that isn't going to happen. There is no way I could get through a whole sentence without giving away a spoiler or two so if you are yet to see it, my recommendation would be to do so before anything is ruined.The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman shines throughout and the ensemble works beautifully. There is, of course, much inappropriate behaviour from Deadpool, making this arguably the funniest edition to the series, but what stands out the most is the heart with which the film is built on. A cinematic experience that was worth waiting for, let's hope there is more to come soon from the 'Marvel Jesus'.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
729,9.0,27-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is a total blast. Any concerns of Deadpool being watered down in his violence, profanity or fourth wall breaking nature upon entering the MCU are instantly disproven in the hilarious and gleefully violent opening scene. It's not preoccupied with saving the MCU, offering a really funny double act between two genuine friends and perfectly cast actors in a film that doesn't forget about the sincerity that completes a Deadpool film.Ryan Reynolds accomplishes a hard task of being a real motor mouth once again without becoming annoying. There's only really one joke that properly overstays it's welcome and he's still given plenty of emotional weight to work with so it doesn't feel like empty calories. Plus, his fourth wall breaks get away with a surprisingly high amount of jabs at the current state of MCU as well as helping the film to overcome the messy and convoluted plotting.Hugh Jackman's return was always going to undermine Logan in some capacity so the best case scenario is doing minimal damage to that perfect ending and that's achieved here. As well as pairing beautifully with Reynolds, Jackman's performance makes it clear that this is a very different Wolverine to any of the other's with a new arc that allows this version to get a satisfying arc over the course of the adventure.Shawn Levy's direction gets the job done. He's by no means an auteur however he is a filmmaker who's done his fair share of blockbusters and worked with Jackman & Reynolds multiple times already, so he makes sure everything keeps moving along nicely with action scenes that are mostly well constructed. The characters may be invulnerable but Levi only uses that to indulge in the gore like never before.The soundtrack has always been a major highlight of the Deadpool films and this one reaches new heights. The songs are employed a lot more than Rob Simonsen's forgettable score and the ones chosen are so good that they're able to make up for the score. Bye Bye Bye and Like a Prayer are the best by far, which is especially fitting since those two bookend the film beautifully.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I may even go back and watch it again as there is so much happens it's hard to take in, in one sitting.Superb fight scenes, with some pent up anger left over from when WW and Wolverine first meet!!Go and watch it - enjoy and be prepared to laugh your tits off!!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The fight scenes between Logan and Deadpool were nice. The rest were exaggerated choreographs. And all the guest stars appearances felt like walking over a graveyard and opening caskets. Until they opened the grave of Remy LeBeau and instead of Taylor Kitsch, we get the low IQ stripper who can't act with this ridiculous accent.

735,1.0,25-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a highly enjoyable film within its category. If you're looking for a complex story with deep character development, plot twists, and a need for intense concentration, this probably isn't the movie for you. However, as a light yet thoroughly entertaining watch, it succeeds in achieving its goals.The film shines in its simplicity, delivering the kind of action-packed fun one would expect from a pairing of these iconic characters. Personally, I find Deadpool and Wolverine among the most entertaining in the Marvel universe. The inclusion of Deadpool's chaotic energy is precisely what Hugh Jackman's older Wolverine films needed to inject some liveliness.The fight scenes are spectacular, and the humor stays true to Deadpool's irreverent style, far from the childish jokes often found in other Marvel films. This movie retains Deadpool's essence while seamlessly integrating Wolverine's grittier persona. It's a highly recommended watch, especially if you're at least somewhat familiar with the MCU.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

My review of this film may be biased due to my investment in the MCU over the years; however this is an enjoyable experience for anyone who loves comedic marvel action. For comparison this film has very similar aspects to previous Deadpool installments. With this said, there's an awesome culmination of easter eggs, throwbacks and entertaining fights sequences. As expected the story isn't overly daunting for a Deadpool film since often times there a bits of comical relief. This film takes the comedian in Deadpool to the absolute max, there's a constant spotlight on him while also not taking any attention away from Wolverine. In the end, showing both of the protagonists motives makes for a heartfelt and cinematic experience. Something else I loved was the contrast between Deadpool's levity and wolverines stubbornness, making for some good exchanges.

The film also made me reflect on the end of the ""20th Century Fox"" brand, bringing back nostalgic feelings for movies like X-Men from that era.Negatives: This is more of a personal issue, but since it had been a long time since I watched the previous Deadpool films, I couldn't remember many of the characters, which made it hard to feel fully engaged. Additionally, because of my limited English proficiency, I struggled to keep up with Deadpool's fast-paced dialogue and jokes, which left me confused at times. I also don't typically enjoy stories involving multiverses.Overall: While the ""20th Century Fox"" brand has already ended, this movie serves as a nostalgic reminder of that era. However, with its fast and complex dialogue, I don't think it's ideal for those looking to improve their English with subtitles. That said, if you approach it with the goal of enjoying the jokes, action scenes, and the interactions between the characters rather than focusing on the storyline itself, it can be an excellent and highly enjoyable film.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It was tough to make it past the first 45 minutes because it was comprised of boring scenes and lots of unnecessary chatter.Then, when it was supposed to get good, the film turned into a bad MTV video with silly characters and Mad Max-style vehicles.Plot?

The storyline follows the end of existence, with Deadpool being offered a chance to die now or find a happy place to reside until the end. Instead, Deadpool escapes to another world called The Void and seeks help from old friends in the Marvel universe, and hopes to save existence and everyone in it.Directed by Shawn Levy (Free Guy), the film stars Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder), Hugh Jackman (Logan), Dafne Keen (The Acolyte), Matthew Macfadyen (Succession), and Emma Corrin (The Crown).This was a fun rollercoaster, and you could tell everyone involved put a lot into this film. The characters were a blast to watch, the comedy was colorful, and the cameos were brilliant. There's definitely a lot to like here. The action scenes are well-executed, though a minor gripe is that some fight sequences felt repetitive, and I don't prefer CGI blood, but it is what it is. Seeing all the characters fight together was fun. They definitely had some smart twists with characters, but there were aspects of the story that worked better for me than others. I also think they could have used better villains. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds were awesome, and their bickering back and forth carries the film. They looked like they had a lot of fun making it. Leslie Uggams (Sugar Hill) killed her performance in this; she always cracks me up. The ending of this movie was great, and I actually think we will be seeing a lot more Wolverine in our future.In conclusion, Deadpool & Wolverine is a perfect summer popcorn movie that deserves repeat viewings.

Now I won't spoil who shows up in this movie and you will just have to watch for yourself to see. The action is violent, gory, and in your face. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is perfect. I really can't wait to see what Disney does with the next Deadpool film.

This makes for more comedic complexity than in the prior films. The jokes and the story poke fun at the MCU, Disney, (the former Twentieth Century) Fox, the multiverse, and the Fox superhero films of yore. Along with somewhere bad taste sexual jokes and bad taste bodily jokes about violence and anatomy being splattered around as much as the fake/CGI blood there is a good ambiance of fun funny.This is a crowd pleaser. The characters are written to give the actors a few moments of actual acting to do whilst mainly keeping it cool in their character default. It's a light touch which usually stays light and only occasionally becomes a bit heavy going or cloying.There are some silly sci-fi superhero hijinks - nothing too serious or interesting - and some decent effects and action sequences although the action is where 'Deadpool & Wolverine' actually seems weakest: the action is less impressive than the well weighted writing, the easy going acting, the special effects design, or the light direction style.I rate a well satisfied 7/10; for me the best of the trio of cinematic Deadpool: accessible and easy and funny.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This lack of substance and direction in the film undermines the credibility of previous Marvel movies featuring these characters, leaving audiences confused.It's alarming that such a poorly constructed movie can achieve such commercial success. It seems that flashy effects and familiar faces are enough to draw crowds, regardless of the quality of the story or the coherence of the plot. This trend is troubling because it suggests that audiences are more interested in superficial entertainment than in engaging narratives and well-developed characters.The movie fails to honor the legacy of the characters and the stories that have been built over the years. Instead, it feels like a hodgepodge of scenes thrown together without any thought to continuity or depth. This is not what fans of the franchise expect or deserve.In essence, the film's success despite its lack of substance is a reflection of a broader issue in the entertainment industry: the prioritization of profits over quality storytelling. This is a disservice to the audience and to the art of filmmaking. Moving forward, it is crucial for studios to recognize the importance of crafting meaningful stories that respect the intelligence and expectations of their viewers.

Even here when it deals with the multiverse and being the sequel to the Deadpool movies, it still managed to give me that. It also helped that it's filled with cameos of pre-MCU Marvel characters that I grew up with. It was so much fun to see all those cameos and also the fact that everyone had actually something to do rather than just appear out of nowhere. The surprises with some aspects of the cameos were also incredible to watch with a great responsive crowd. That one surprise cameo was really unexpected for me since I had dismissed it as fans going overboard when I first heard about it months ago.The buddy action movie template with a multiversal stake around it worked pretty well as a fun-filled entertainer without having to think much about it. Even though some expositions felt a bit not so creative, they intentionally did it so that anyone could enjoy it even if they weren't aware of the innumerable references, easter eggs and cameos.Hugh Jackman is still such a fantastic Wolverine, giving depth to a weakly written character just using his face. Emma Corrin also surprised me by giving a strong performance, acting against these guys, again with a one-dimensional character.I also loved how this ended up basically a tribute to the pre-MCU Marvel movies, specifically the 20th Century Fox Marvel movies. I was a fan of all those superhero movies growing up. A lot of people didn't really care about such movies until Infinity War came out. And they are the first to cry about how after Endgame, it's not the same. But to me, it's these movies from the 2000s that gave the base for the MCU.

Deadpool has always been wild, but this is the wildest Deadpool movie yet, which took me by surprise. I'm glad there were still cameos they kept hidden.Deadpool himself is as funny and mocking as ever, while Wolverine is as badass and savage as ever. After twenty years, they finally made a costume for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine that is comically accurate and it didn't disappoint. Also, Hugh's acting was the best one in the film, no doubt. Watch the movie and you'll clearly see why. Plus, Deadpool and Wolverine are destined to be played by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. There'll be no one who can replace them and their legacy shall live on forever.Now the little downside of this movie is that it felt too short. Don't misunderstand, the pacing was good, they gave pretty much everything we wanted and hoped for.

Also, I wish they had used IMAX cameras so that the film had an open matte format like Endgame (2019) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023). Other than that, I think I have no problem with this movie.It's hard to talk about the movie a lot without spoiling, but overall, the movie was wild and fun. A film truly made to make every Marvel fan's dream come true. Also, the best movie of 2024 so far IMO. 9/10I wish our great Stan Lee could see this.""I am the Messiah. I am Marvel Jesus.""","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

762,7.0,28-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine! So many things to say about this long-awaited, dream of a team-up!For those who haven't seen it, I will make this review as spoiler-free as possible.Walking into this, I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that this movie would be a lot of fun. But like many of my fellow viewers, the excitement was also accompanied by many concerns.Was it going to be truly Deadpool? Raunchy, violent, and fourth-wall breaking? After being bought by Disney, was it still going to maintain the R-rating that Deadpool was well known for, and pull it off? After the recent decline of the MCU, would it ruin our beloved heroes, or would it be Marvel's saving grace that they desperately needed?Well, after seeing this movie, I can say it was the worst of the Deadpool films. But it's also everything I hoped for.I loved this movie. It was a vulgar, violent, and hilarious ride. Seeing Wolverine and Deadpool banter back-and-forth for two hours is what every fan had hoped to see. It was a compelling story, with plenty of self-aware humor about Marvel. It had plenty of cameos, all of which made me extremely glad to see on the big screen. It also had great actors, choreography, and action scenes. None of which, disappoint.If you were worried that Deadpool would be different after 20th Century Fox got bought out, I can tell you now that those fears can be put to rest, and that you will have a grand time seeing this in the cinema.But with all of the positives, there were definitely some negatives.First off, the main antagonist would probably be my biggest complaint. He wasn't really a VILLAIN. He wasn't scary. He was a wimpy, man-child throughout the entire film, which kind of sucked to see. He had the potential to be very intimidating, but obviously, the studio went a different direction.Other than that, some of the humor doesn't really quite land. Although yes, it did have a lot of funny moments, it doesn't feel EXACTLY like the past two Deadpool films. But that's a very minor concern.Overall, the pacing was nice and it was worth a trip to the theatre. I would recommend it, and I say it's a big step-up from superhero movies in recent years. Will it save Marvel? Probably not. But it was a breath of fresh air. It also felt really good to see Wolverine adorning his classic, yellow suit, and brandishing his claws again. The cameos were a welcome surprise, and Deadpool being Deadpool was exactly the change that the MCU needed. 7.5/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
763,8.0,26-Jul-24,"Best Marvel movie in a long time. Deadpool and Wolverine surprise with a spectacular tape, full of cameos and great moments of action. It's worth every second and you're gonna laugh a lot.Director Shawn Levy did a sensational job, being well directed and with a well-sustained narrative argument in the multiverse aspect, even better performed than in ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"". Deadpool 3 is great in the way it unfolds at certain points in the script because of the universes that Marvel has presented for many years, giving a close to the Deadpool trilogy and some way to do it. This sequel is a barbarity for the mutant fans and for those who saw many characters from the editorial in their live action films of the 2000's, applying nostalgia and many surprises to the plot of the film.Ryan Reynolds's great work should be highlighted, whether from his production, script and acting as Wade Wilson. The actor makes it excellent and once again brings to the table the character character comedy like in Deadpool 1 and 2. On the other hand Hugh Jackman as Logan once again is of the best that can have a Marvel tape, the actor demonstrates that he was born to be the character and in this sequel shines through each scene, showing another variant of Wolverine more wild and epic for the big screen.In the special effects section Deadpool and Wolverine has an excellent job. A CGI that possesses an extraordinary level of detail worthy of a mercenary film. These approaches can also be highlighted camera, soundtrack, photography, assembly and staging.However, all that addition of characters and cameos to the tape are one of the key points to keep the hype for each viewer, being some very well performed and others wasted in different scenes. Still, Deadpool helps in this argument by giving those more than logical jokes that really help answer your doubts. Marvel's Jesus did it excellent.8.5/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It becomes apparent that someone worked really hard, not only to get this movie made, but to make it into what it is: pure joy and entertainment. This movie reminded me of what entertainment really is about. I had forgotten, because the corporate overlords at Disney doesn't want to entertain us anymore, they want to lecture us and lectures are never entertaining if you didn't chose to attend them by free will. This movie does the complete opposite. It takes you on an adventure, but it also checks in on you now and then just to see to that you are entertained, it gives you little moments to breath and, by god, if it didn't put a tear to my eye at one point. This movie cherry picks all the best parts of the previous two movies and manages to make it into a firework of action, drama and humor (I can't even remember the last time I laughed so hard, out loud, so many times, in a movie theatre).

As crazy as Martian Riggs as Cowboy as John McClain and almost Axel Foley (in the first two movies) funny. If the term star power was more literal than Reynolds would be an Omega Level Mutant.And speaking of Omega Level, here comes Hugh Jackman. Perfectly reprising the role that made him a star 24 years ago, it always feels like he became more Wolverine with each movie. This movie is no exception simple because he's wearing that costume. It's like he could never say he perfected the character unless he puts the costume on (now if only we can cut his height down a foot). Mr. Jackman, thank you so much for coming back one hundred percent in the game!I would say more but I really should not. Let's just say it's one of the best action films you will watch and Reynolds and Jackman are two great actors who mastered their characters and came together with a chemistry that would make their wives question their intent.Trade your brain in for a tub of popcorn and enjoy!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Didn't have much punch to them, but they were more interested in having fast energy through show comedic scene. So that is forgivable.Surprise about how much music there was in it it felt like a musical but luckily because of the constant breaking of the fourth wall, It is hard to get taken out of the movie when there's music I recognize because I am already less invested in the realness of it and more in the funiness of it.Watching two adults stapping each other is fun and going to the cinema to see it with a friend is even more fun.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I had a smile on my face throughout the opening sequence and kept it for most of the film. The movie was packed with jokes and is definitely a comedy first and foremost. We also get to see Deadpool genuinely care about saving his world.I was absolutely blindsided by the appearance of ""Captain America."" It's impressive how they managed to keep so many secrets and cameos from leaking, even though the story had been theorized by fans for a while. The movie is great and really funny, but the story itself isn't particularly groundbreaking. Despite the grand scale-Deadpool literally trying to save a universe-it didn't feel dense or carry much weight.At the same time, I understand why. The MCU has faced criticism for making the multiverse phase too convoluted and confusing, especially for the average viewer who hasn't seen every movie and TV show. So, despite the scale of this movie, the story remains very easy and simple to follow. It felt like Marvel was playing it safe, which makes sense and worked out well for what Marvel maybe needed at this point.I loved the movie; it was fun, funny, and simple. However, it didn't wow me. It didn't need to be a cinematic masterpiece or the best MCU movie ever made-it just had to be good and give hope for mcu's future. It delivered on that. Plus basically a perfect Deadpool trilogy. I have more thoughts, but they are quite spoiler-y. I also thought Cassandra Nova could have been a much more menacing villain. They showed her strength, but her character was quite underdeveloped. I hope she comes back in future movies.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

One major issue is its reliance on outdated and often uncomfortable jokes about homosexuality. Rather than engaging in witty, thoughtful humor, the film resorts to repetitive, crude stereotypes that feel both lazy and offensive. These jokes not only undermine the potential for genuine character development but also detract from the overall narrative. In the end, while the film tries to offer a unique crossover experience, it ultimately gets bogged down by its problematic and insensitive humor.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
793,8.0,28-Jul-24,"The Deadpool films have always been very enjoyable to me. They've never been endlessly rewatchable, simply due to the crass humour from start to finish, but that's just because I don't want to get tired of them. The first two films found a way to make me smile, but I never felt the need to keep revisiting those same jokes. This time around, we're in a whole new era. Since Disney purchased 20th Century Fox, we've known they were going to let this R-rated franchise continue, but in what way? Well, Deadpool & Wolverine has now hit theatres and I must admit, I once again had a solid time and it is probably the most fun I've had with any of these movies, even though the overall film itself fits right in line with the first two, quality-wise. This is a consistently entertaining franchise of 4/5 star films. Here's why I enjoyed this one, but also why I have a few concerns for those who don't follow every Marvel project.Without getting into too many details, the basic premise of Deadpool & Wolverine begins with Deadpool being pulled into the TVA, where he learns that his world is dying and there's nothing he can do about it. Realizing that Wolverine/Logan passing away is the reason for this, he makes it his mission to hop through dimensions to find another version of that character to help him save his world and the only people he cares about. This leads them to a wasteland where characters and things from the past have all been forgotten. From there, chaos ensues, surprises will please many audience members, and the story becomes more emotionally driven than expected.Again without giving anything away, there are a lot of cameos in this film and I enjoyed every single one of them, whether they were used for a cheap pop or a meaningful reason for being there. The use of a certain character had me in tears and another had me laughing hysterically, so I had a great time with the cameo aspects. The story is also effective enough that it held my attention, but the true core of this film comes down to Deadpool and Wolverine. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds have clearly dreamt of doing a movie like this together and it shows. Their chemistry is electric and this is definitely a side we haven't seen from Jackman yet as this character. They made this a great experience.There are also needle drops every few minutes, but most of them worked in the context of the scenes. Shawn Levy has directed many films in the past, but never anything like this, so it was nice to see he was capable of content like this. What else can I say about this one? Well, the action is great (like all of the Deadpool films), the cast is fantastic, the humour works 90% of the time, the surprises are a plenty, and the third act actually reeled back from what I thought would be happening. I have to admit that people may have set their expectations a little high as to who and how many characters might appear, but in general, I have no complaints there; However, there are concerns I have for certain audience members.They make it easy enough to follow everything, but some appearances and stories carry over from shows and pieces from other films that, if you haven't seen everything, may make you scratch your head. I know there will be elements lost on some people, but at least the whole point of the movie is just about Deadpool and Wolverine. It's far from perfect and a few aspects (which would spoil your enjoyment if I said them here) are very easy to nitpick, but I have to be honest and say I had a really good time. I can't wait to see more. Deadpool & Wolverine is now playing in theatres.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

From the jaw-dropping opening scene to the top-tier cinematic entrance shots, the slow-motion camera work, and the hilarious bickering between Deadpool and Wolverine - it was pure gold. The fire-lit backgrounds, the suits, and the epic action scenes had me audibly reacting in the theater. Deadpool's slicing, shooting, and fighting were like something straight out of a video game. Fun, funny, and full of thrills - Deadpool nailed it on all three fronts.And the cameos! Oh, the cameos! There were plenty, and each one had a twist that left me grinning. Each character truly embodied their roles, and it was awesome to see Deadpool, Wolverine, and various Sony characters making their way into the MCU. Sure, it's not quite on par with the Spider-Man movie (insert Spider-Man pointing meme here), but it's close.Now, brace yourselves for my critique. Despite hitting many of the right notes, Deadpool 3 felt like it was missing a true purpose, a real threat, and a compelling villain. It seemed like Deadpool was being set up as the MCU's savior, with heavy influences from Dune and Mad Max. This lack of a solid antagonist left much to be desired - so much so that I canceled my second viewing. That's a big deal for me, considering I saw the first and second installments of Deadpool multiple times in theaters.In the end, I'm giving Deadpool and Wolverine a solid 7.5 out of 10 - or about an 4 out of 5 stars. Yes, it's a good Marvel film with plenty of comic book references and a shoutout to ugly Deadpool dog (no offense), but it just lacked that extra oomph to push it over the edge.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
801,6.0,27-Jul-24,This movie is a bit of a weird one to rate. I absolutely loved this movie but definitely wasnt perfect. Some of the action scenes weren't the best looking and some of the jokes fell really flat. Obviously it wasn't amazingly written but like it wasn't that bad either.While I'm giving this 10 stars at the moment it definitely will change as a lot of this movies shock and awe was based off its cameos and the like. This movie was a bit like no way home in terms of that but this movie does it so much better. The villian was kind of mid and honestly could have been better with a professor X cameo. Still really good movie though. 10/10.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I loved the original Deadpool movie, but wasn't a huge fan of the sequel so was nervous about this entry. Also there was so much hype about this movie...could it possibly live up?Yes! Yes, it did! The story was excellent, the jokes were funny, the references and callbacks hit all the right nostalgic notes. Ryan and Hugh were both sensational. I really can't believe they can both pull off these characters all these years later, but it's just like comic book magic!

They stuck to story and threw em out there here and there. 2nd movie they did just a Lil more and was still Great. But this one it's non stop! It takes away from the story being told. And to me it gives the impression of they have to do it bc they running out of ideas to fill the void and time. Less is More in this situation! And again it is just my opinion as a movie viewer. The fight scenes, wardrobe, characters make everything worth watching tho.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
805,8.0,29-Aug-24,"If you have made it so far past the premiere without getting spoiled, congratulations! I wouldn't have minded waiting for VOD, but spoilers just keep popping up on social media, articles and reels without looking for them. It isn't that the plot is being spoiled, but rather the main appeal of the movie. Going to see the third instalment of the Deadpool franchise, you probably know already what you're in for. Crude humor, violence, jokes and cameos. Said cameos would have entertained me more, would I have not known that they were coming.The Deadpool movies cannot in my opinion work in a vacuum. Just watching these 3 movies without awareness about the stuff they are referencing is almost pointless. To get the most out of the third one, you should be at least aware of comic book movies since the late 90s (not gonna name them though).Me being a 90s kid, watching comic book movies as they came out, I feel like I was the target audience, and all the gags, fan service and cameos really made me laugh. I rate the Deadpool movies all pretty much the same, this isn't any better or worse than the first two. You know the drill, you'll get what you came for.As a Wolverine movie, it is surely better than Origins (most things are) but not even approaching Logan (few movies do). What I'd change or improve on the movie, is that the story is a bit underdeveloped. Particularly the backstory why Logan is so morose is only told, not shown. But I guess I'd require further cameos that would bloat the budget...On a Sidenote: Dafne Keen has matured nicely and Emma Corrin has a voice like honey. Does she do audiobooks?

The humor was awful, infantile, and distasteful. Half of the movie didn't make sense, lots of fillers and in general was too stretched out.

I can't spoil any of it for you, except to say that it's so much more than I expected to see! I absolutely loved this movie!If I have any complaint about this movie, it would be that some of the returning villain cameos (the ones that everyone has already pointed out from the trailers and publicity stills) just weren't long enough to make them everything they could have been. However, I totally understand how, in order to make those cameos pay off the way they should have, they would have had to make the movie over three hours long. So, while it would have been better in my humble opinion to have close ups and dialog with those characters, I can totally understand why some of those scenes were pared down to give more room to those scenes which provided much of the necessary content that gave purpose to the actual story.Long story short (I would say too late, but have you read some of the other reviews?!?

The script did not disappoint, it was dynamic and held enough surprises to keep you engaged throughout. The timing was definitely on point, every moment of repartee seemed to keep the pace at a dizzying speed.The action sequences, in my opinion, surpassed the incredible work of the first and second installments. I'm waiting for my rewind button to be able to back up for everything that I missed. Visually stunning, the artists that kept putting in Easter Eggs for us should be praised.Reynolds and Jackman put in maximum effort on their delivery, as we knew they would. The supporting cast brought their A games as well. I'll spare going into any depth at this time, because, spoilers.What I didn't expect was the amount of credit, homage and just sheer respect not only to past projects and those involved, but also to the fans.

810,1.0,12-Aug-24,"Finally Marvel has admitted quite directly that the multiverse saga has been a train wreck. Deadpool was the perfect character to do this. In putting Deadpool with Wolverine , Marvel has essentially been able to start the tare down and rebuild in the same movie. I was worried bringing back Wolverine was out of desperation, and it probably was, but it paid off. It was nice having Wolverine's seriousness to offset when Deadpool does in fact get annoying at times. Wolverines world also reminds you that some good superhero movies have been made and maybe it's possible again.As for the actual plot of this movie it's not really all that interesting. However, making the TVA a key feature of the movie was also clever. One thing from this saga most enjoyed was Loki. By including the TVA, Marvel has set up the potential for a nice conclusion to the saga instead of dragging us through more money making clutter.One thing that I will also add is that aside from Endgame , having watched lots of previous content will make the film much more rewarding. There are a lot of nice easter eggs along the way in this one. The soundtrack is probably also second best to Guardians.In conclusion, as a stand alone , the movie would probably be average with some funny moments you'd forget by the end of the ride home from the theatre. However , in setting up a promising future in just one movie, I say well done to a franchise that has not done much but let down for years now.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Known more for his relationship then his mediocre movies he films the first Deadpool and shoots himself to the stars. He is not playing Deadpool, he is Deadpool and he took advantage of that the best way possible using it to become a super successful businessman and marketing executive. He knows his strengths and his weakness expertly and plays exactly on them.Having said all that about my admiration of what he has accomplished, I have, like many experienced superhero fatigue. Enough with multiverses and meaningless super heros. The Deadpool team knows it and plays it perfectly. Put on top of that Hugh Jackman who is going to be impossible to replace ad wolverine (until you are 90) and a bunch of Easter eggs and cameos this is an honest to God fun film. Don't care if the story is the greatest story ever or whatever other technical problema people have found, this was a fun fun film to watch. It's not End Game, it's not super complicated and it knows and not only it doesn't care, it adcertises it and enjoys it.

I probably had an overdose of multiverse and time and reality adventures in recent years that this movie was only alright for me.So, come to the movie to appreciate the visual and crude humor and familiar characters from bizarre alternate reality.

817,8.0,27-Jul-24,"Deadpool 1 and 2 were some of the best things to come out of Fox. When Disney brought Fox, I hoped that Ryan Reynolds would remain as Deadpool. Thankfully this is the case but they also brought back Hugh Jackman as Wolverine despite the perfect send-off in Logan. Does Deadpool continue to entertain or is this a tainting of Ryan and Hugh Jackman's legacy?Let's get the obvious out of the way, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are still phenomenal as their Deadpool and Wolverine respectively. Both of them have excellent antagonistic chemistry. The contrast between Jackman's serious performance and Reynolds's jokey performance is incredibly fun to watch. What made previous Deadpool movies great is that while it was primarily a comedy, it had a lot of heart too. This is still the case here. Deadpool's love for Vanessa and his friends is still here and despite his stupid antics, it is very clear he is serious about them. Wolverine has immense guilt and Jackman's excellent performance conveys the pain perfectly. Both have great character arcs that are honestly very heart-warming and satisfying.On that note, the comedy continues to be hilarious! You still get the crude and dirty jokes, the fun meta ones, the downright silly ones. All of which got a chuckle out of me. What I appreciate most though is that the movie doesn't shy away from jokes that point fun at Disney or the current state of the MCU. The movie being part of the multiverse saga did worry me about it being a cameo fest. There are definitely moments with short appearances of individuals but there are also some proper appearances. Some of these ""cameos"" feel more like a supporting character. The movie also has a killer soundtrack that is used very effectively. There is a great sequence with Madonna and NSYNC that still stick in my mind. There are also some very entertaining action sequences that are well-choreographed. There is an excellent one in the intro and a unique one involving a car.Yet, for some reason, one of the action sequences in the beginning of the 3rd act is just weirdly bad. This one particular action set piece had such awful cuts and shaky camera that it was nearly impossible to tell what was going on. It is weird as every action set piece before was terrific and even the one after is amazing. None of them had shaky camera, except that one particular one. The Deadpool movies have had a lot of jokes that feel like you would need a bit of knowledge of things that occurred in the real world to understand. In this entry, there are definitely a lot more of these types of jokes. I understood all of it which is why it made me laugh but I was watching the movie with someone else and the jokes flew over their head. It's not a big problem but it is something to note, especially if you plan on watching this with another person.One of the weakest aspects of this movie compared to previous entries is the story. The stakes are higher than it ever has been with the whole universe of Deadpool being at stake. The problem is that we don't ever really feel it. There is no tension, suspense or urgency to the oncoming doom. Deadpool and Wolverine don't ever feel like they're in any rush. The multiverse setting also results in what feels like nothing is truly ever at stake. Characters could die but it never really feels like their death means anything. It also introduces more rules to the multiverse and it just raises so many questions. Despite this being a Deadpool movie in the MCU, the story is very inconsequential and doesn't really add anything. I also find the villain, Cassandra Nova, to be quite dull. They have cool powers and Emma Corrin gives a lively performance as the character. However, the villain's motive is very weak and they are not given enough depth for us to care one bit about them.Overall, Deadpool is Marvel Jesus. After a lot of stinkers from MCU movies, we finally get a genuinely great one. It doesn't taint the legacy left behind by Fox X-Men movies. If anything, Deadpool & Wolverine is a celebration of those past movies. It respectfully honours our nostalgia while also giving us hope for the future of MCU movies. I can't wait to see where Deadpool will turn up next!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This move is the conclusion of the Fox era of Marvel and as this film points out, it was a bittersweet journey that set the foundation for the current Marvel era.

823,7.0,31-Jul-24,"""Welcome to the MCU! You're joining at a low point"" tells the merc with a mouth to a brooding, self-loathing and hurting Wolverine. This line, along with the many fourth wall breaks that the titular anti-hero Deadpool performs now and then serve as a reminder about what this whole thing's business is: setting the record straight. It's a brash ad campaign for the fact that Disney is not afraid of the R-rating and that its questionable decisions in the past regarding the MCU were just one of many directions they can go. Make no mistake, this is Disney showing off but the reason why none of us are bothered by it is because this movie is helmed by flamboyant, relatable and wicked Ryan Reynolds (and I really do mean ""helmed"", as he is also part of the three co-writers).So then begins a dare: how many Joker-esque puns involving gore, drug abuse and masturbation (sometimes all at once) can one anti-hero cramp into a two hour running time before Disney gets its point across and the whole thing becomes an endurance test? Well, apparently a bit too many because by the end, the movie's sequential rapid-fire anecdotes do start to get tiring. Even Reynolds admits this, as there is a moment close to the ending of the movie where Deadpool looks at the camera and tells the audience to hang in there, as we are on the home stretch. I admit, having such a loveable hunk like Reynolds asking us to bear with him did make me cut him some slack.But while ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" might not be the best of movies, it's definitely worthy of belonging to the upper echelon of Marvel movies when it comes to entertainment. Its moments of fun are just cramming to get on the screen, most of them hitting the comedic timing perfectly: pop culture references, socio-political parodies and snappy one-liners that take you by surprise--I nearly choked on soda at one point). But they have to be like that, because there is not much depth to them. It's like doomscrolling through a webpage of memes whose lasting power is as brief as they appear on the screen, except that the memes are done professionally. It's all part of the dare.But this is not what all this movie is. There are moments when even the most depraved of anti-heroes must stop and take a look around. When the mask is off and Deadpool becomes Wade Wilson, he struggles with relatable personal pain like insignificance and meaning--""I don't know how to be a hero"", he says at one point. This movie's plot, beneath all the distractions, is more or less him finding out how. And also not to mention Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, whose performance seems to only get better with age. He is a defeated and lost soul tormented by a great pain involving past failures. Together, Deadpool & Wolverine become the buddy-comedy duo of the MCU.After watching this movie, a lot of people might feel hope for the future of the MCU. Self-proclaimed internet pundits might even punch themselves in the chest, claiming Disney finally saw the errors of its ways and returned to form. But we cannot be sure that this is just not another phase--after all, of course a movie involving Deadpool would put the ESRB to work. Plus, regardless of anything, there is only so many ideas and so much energy a franchise has, even something as big as the MCU. I'm not saying the good days are behind us, I'm just saying that no promises have been made. Still, I will definitely smirk when I will inevitably see this quirky poster on Disney's streaming service next to the likes of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"" or ""The Sound of Music"".","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

832,1.0,2-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" (2024) is a highly entertaining and humorous addition to the Deadpool franchise. Directed by Shawn Levy, the film features Ryan Reynolds reprising his role as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman returning as Wolverine, delivering strong performances with their characteristic charm and chemistry.The film's plot involves Wade Wilson (Deadpool) coming out of retirement to address a new existential threat, leading to a team-up with Wolverine. This installment is noted for its comedic tone, with plenty of meta-humor, fourth-wall breaks, and fast-paced gags that fans of the previous films will appreciate. The humor is even more pronounced than in the first two movies, making it the funniest entry yet.Despite being an R-rated film under Disney, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" does not shy away from adult content, featuring gratuitous violence and strong language, ensuring that it remains true to its predecessors in terms of tone and content.While the film excels in humor and action, it does face some criticism for its pacing and the underdevelopment of its villains. However, the strong performances by Reynolds and Jackman, along with numerous cameos and nostalgic references, more than make up for these shortcomings. The film serves as a fitting tribute to the Fox/Marvel universe and is likely to be a hit among fans of the franchise.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a delightful, action-packed film that embraces its chaotic, comedic nature, making it a must-watch for fans of the Deadpool series and Marvel enthusiasts alike.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This was just a reason to put Wolverine on the big screen with Deadpool with no thought given to how to develop a story and actually make it make sense. I was shocked by how bored I was during the movie and how meaningless it felt. Maybe the last Marvel movie I'll ever go to.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The cameos are well integrated to the plot and doesn't serve as ""nostalgia-bait"". If Deadpool 1 is about Love and Deadpool 2 is about Family, this is about Friendship and Brotherhood despite being total opposites.The only thing I hate about this is the fact that my life is now meaningless and I have nothing else to look forward to...

838,1.0,30-Jul-24,"I am a huge fan of the Deadpool movie and the Wolverine movies & I am a huge fan of all the Marvel and DC superhero movies but I went in not sure if this was going to be a good movie but as the credits started to roll I wanted the movie to keep going. It is action packed from beginning to end, it's extremely funny and the entire storyline was amazing as well as the movie using Madonna's number 1 hit song like a prayer from her 1989 like a prayer album.Also a little trivia about them using Madonna's song Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman had to go to Madonna's house to ask for permission to use the song Madonna wanted them to come in person and from what Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman said on the TV show the view last week Madonna actually gave them Ideas for the scene where the music was used and the Director actually listened to Madonna and made the few changes and added a few things for Madonna to approve it and it's rare for Madonna to ever allow her music to be used in movies.P. S I've loved Madonna since her 1st single in 1983Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman did an outstanding job and the chemistry they had on the screen was amazing but not surprising considering in real life they are extremely close friends & for any of those who have left negative reviews you're just a tad bit insane because I couldn't find one thing wrong with the movie and Marvel Studios made a home run movie with this. Also this movie was a huge blockbuster hit Deadpool & Wolverine' Lands 6th Biggest Opening of All Time.The Ryan Reynolds Hugh Jackman superhero movie smashed numerous records both domestically and overseas for a stunning global launch of $444.1 million & it certainly made it money back considering the budget on the film was 200 million.I really hope that they make a sequel to this because it definitely deserves a sequel because it was that good. Also, as far as the negative reviews do NOT listen to them at all because people have become so picky & insane about everything marvel & DC does makes, these so-called marvel/DC fans have trashed the last few superhero movies that were all excellent movies. I truly don't know what they want or expect but I don't ever listen to the negative reviews because when people say it's horrible I end up loving it.I truly don't know what people are looking for in these superhero movies anymore. They're amazing so again do NOT listen to the negative reviews. Go see the movie for yourself and I'm sure you will love it as much as I did.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I haven't been this excited about a film since Spiderman: Far From Home. The film has a running time of 2 hrs but those hours felt too short with all the visuals that it had. This film made me excited about the next projects Marvel is going to put out. They have been releasing filler movies previously that were flopping; but they look to be going back to excitement.

845,9.0,27-Jul-24,"Despite being an overall enjoyable ride, ultimately Deadpool & Wolverine is a disappointment.On the surface the movie seems to have the same ingredients as its predecessors: tons of immature jokes out of which a small percentage is actually funny, constant pop culture references, fourth wall breaking, cameos and abundant violence. But there's one key ingredient missing: heart.Where DP 1&2 had great chemistry between characters, DP&W has nothing, not even between the titular duo. Reynolds and Jackman act out the same caricature in a series of sketches - one is an annoying idiot (this time for real, they managed to dumb down even Deadpool) while another growls angrily. There's no convincing character development or bonding here - just whining that one wants to matter and save his friends while another let everyone down and is thus sad and grumpy. Wade and Vanessa's relationship went from believable and touching to virtually nothing: there's now an implausible problem between them made up specifically for this movie, and it gets resolved automatically for the sake of happy ending without any effort on their part.All of which leads to another big problem of this film - its plot, or rather lack thereof. It is just a messy excuse to tie together a few scenes, and if you take a moment to think about what is happening on screen it falls apart instantaneously. It feels like an elongated SNL sketch, or an R-rated Disneyland attraction - there isn't a story being told, it's just going through motions. Now's the time for the 100th gay sex joke from Deadpool (their concentration increased suspiciously now that it's a Disney production), and now on to an obligatory uninspired blandly-choreographed fight. Quick pause for cameo, repeat for 2 hours straight. The first two Deadpool movies made it just fine without a convincing antagonist, but this time around the two villains are such painfully evident overly-grimacing cardboard cutout cliches that it gets so jarring to watch them.Sure, there are some cameos that are actually surprising and well-done (I didn't watch any trailer past the first one), and jokes that land (do watch the after-credits scene, it's hilarious). Time flies by relatively fast, even if with some drags closer to the third act, and I left the screening with an overall positive impression, but still, sadly, Deadpool & Wolverine is a huge step down compared to Deadpool 1 & 2.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
846,1.0,24-Aug-24,"Disney has the reverse Midas touch and when you compare this Deadpool to the first two, it really shows.Ryan Reynold's jokes, while witty, got a little tiring because they didn't really go anywhere or relate to the plot. Multiple jokes at Disney, Fox, being from Canada, including references to the go-to fast food in one of the cities he lived in, ans countless gay jokes toward Wolverine which amounted to nothing. Like if you're gonna go the route of gay jokes, at least give me some action like a make out scene between Deadpool and Wolverine.The plot? There is no plot. It's your typical Disney Marvel movie, which is just CGI violence that goes nowhere. This one was slightly better in that it was the jokes of Ryan Reynolds with CGI violence. But basically no different than if you watched stand up comedy and video game demo at the same time.The antagonist, like every other Disney Marvel movie, was British. The UK has more dialects of English than the rest of the world combined, yet for some reason every Disney villain has the same British accent.And like all Disney movies, it was ugly. The characters were all unattractive to look at, despite the actors not being unattractive in real life. The scenery was ugly, and everything had that orange tint to it.If Ryan Reynolds did Stand-up, I would watch it. But Disney maybe needs to pay their actors less and take that extra money to pay someone who actually knows how to write a screenplay.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

We live in a world where standup comics have to tone down their material for fear of triggering, and email users have to watch the words they use for fear of ""misinformation"" laws (Canada). But, wonder of wonders, this film teaches us that there yet remains a sacred space where ANY topic can be mocked, riffed, and deconstructed, with no fear of reprisal. In fact, the money just rolls in. No matter that 7 decades of canon and character-building are sacrificed. No matter that an entire generation is growing up thinking this is the way films are supposed to be made. The good news is that Jackman gets a payday (which he deserves), and Reynolds thinks he is funnier than Robin Williams (which he isn't). All in all, a merry time was had by all.

The jokes are actually funny and the violence is actually necessary although of course amplified to add to the humor.

861,6.0,28-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is the third Deadpool film. This film is directed, partly written and produced by Shawn Levy, director of Night at the Museum, Reel Steal and Free Guy.After all Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) his adventures he is now trying to take it easy. He tries to live a more normal life, without using his superhero alter ego Deadpool. This changes when the time agents of the TVA come after him for all the adjustments he has made to the timelines.When mutant Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) then forms a bigger oath, Deadpool must try to stop this threat together with a variant of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), before all timelines are in danger.After Disney took over the film studio 20th Century Fox, they also got the film rights of the X-men, as well as the rights of the character Deadpool. Deadpool is actually not a character you expect to see in the more child-friendly world of Disney. Fortunately, they have found a good way to bring back the character of Deadpool in a familiar way, without making it really child-friendly. This is, strangely enough, the first official r rated superhero film in the Marvel film series.It is good to see that Disney now also seems to dare to make more adult films, so that they can also please older viewers. This film is such an entertaining r rated film, with brutal action, blood, swear words and other adult material. The Disney film studio gives itself more opportunities to also make films about adult material. In this way, in addition to family and children's films, they can now also try to reach the adult target group with their own r rated films. In addition, they can now also try to use other, more adult acquired film rights from 20th Century Fox, to also make these film series their own or to continue with them.Ryan Reynolds has, in addition to playing the lead role, also been involved in this film as a producer and writer. In this way, he has made a great effort to ensure that the character remains as well-known as possible for fans of the character. Fans who know Deadpool from the two previous Deadpool films, from the comics or from other films, or animations can have a similar experience with this new film. Furthermore, he also provides many moments of meta humor about the film world, other things from pop culture and of course moments where he breaks the fourth wall. Hugh Jackman seemed to be done with playing the Wolverine character, after the film Logan from 2017. When Ryan shared his ideas with him, to come back as the character again, he eventually did so. The two are also good friends with each other and, like their characters, have good chemistry. In this way, they know how to play well with and against each other.Fortunately, the story has also become a good thing of its own, because many feared that this film would become more of a film with comic references and cameos. Several cameos and references are in the film, but fortunately without them overshadowing the film and trying to be something of their own. So, after a more low point in the Marvel film series, they can hopefully handle the future film ideas and stories a bit better after this film and get the series back in shape.Director Shawn Levy already has experience with directing action films, but in this comic film adaptation, during some action scenes, many things happen at the same time with several different characters. Here, everything is sometimes not always clearly shown, so you can't always follow everything exactly. This can sometimes take you out of the film or cause confusion.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

865,9.0,26-Jul-24,"Ok so just to make this clear, I'm just a casual moviegoer who decided to watch this movie because I had nothing better to do. I'm not a Marvel fan, and I haven't watched any of the X-men movies. With all this in mind, I was due for some pretty interesting surprises.What I can say from my experience, with all due respect, is that I could most easily relate this to No Way Home (one of the few Marvel movies I've actually seen). Although the story itself is kind of convoluted and ties into lore from several previous X-men and Marvel installments, most of the experience is carried by the non-stop action and satirical jokes by Deadpool, which filled the movie from start to finish. The reason I tend to compare this movie to No Way Home is because I think both are films that are designed primarily for the life-time fans of the franchises (hence the many cameos), however they tend to provide a solid and (to an extent) smooth experience for many casual moviegoers like me. If I had to pick my preference between the two I'd have to go with this one, just because of the amount of jokes that kept me rolling.Maybe your wondering the reason I only gave this movie 7 stars. Like I said, I'm not a Marvel fan and I haven't seen any of the other Deadpool films so of course I'm not going to understand every little detail. My primary criticism with the movie comes from the lack of explanation or clarification to just how insanely convoluted and twisted the entire premise of the movie is, let alone the hero's' objectives. I guess I'm not fluent enough with the X-men lore to have understood many of the details regarding the characters and their universes, although I will say it definitely had an impact on my experience. I know it may seem a little mixed because this movie itself is technically a sequel (although I had no idea how interconnected the Deadpool franchise was with the X-men universe).I could go on about this and highlight more of my specific praises and criticisms with the movie but at the end of the day, I can appreciate it for what it's trying to be, even though it's not my kind of movie. I'd probably only recommend this to people who've at least seen enough Deadpool or X-men films to have a basic understanding of the worldbuilding. However, I still had a good time with it, and to anyone else who enjoys action-filled dark comedies I think you'll have a damn good time with it as well.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

867,1.0,29-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine, directed by Shawn Levy, is an obnoxious film that stars Ryan Reynolds and is a double act already paired up in Marvel comic books. Both are self-healers, have authority issues, and have substance abuse problems. However, their differences, such as being slashed, stabbed, and punched out in close combat in a Honda minivan, give the film its juice. The film earns every last month of its 15 certificate for its gore and risque gags. Deadpool and Wolverine are flung together after the timeline of Deadpool's universe is threatened with abrupt termination by Mr. Paradox, a rogue agent of the Time Variance Authority. Since the death of the Wolverine in Deadpool's universe is a key factor in its demise, Deadpool goes multiverse-hopping for a replacement, finding the worst version - a self-loathing, drunken failure. Redemption beckons, but not before plenty of effects-driven carnage and a run-in with Cassandra, the deranged evil twin of Professor Charles Xavier. The film earns every last month of its 15 certificate for its gore and risque gags. Disney acquired 20th Century Fox in 2018 and began working on its first sequel to Deadpool, a popular R-rated Marvel character. Despite being from the Marvel label, Reynolds' character was not easily adapted into Disney's less edgy PG-13 Marvel Cinematic Universe. Six years later, the first R-rated MCU movie, Deadpool & Wolverine, was released in 2024, bringing a dream teaming for fans. The results for Deadpool & Wolverine are truly out of this world. Deadpool & Wolverine, a film directed by Shawn Levy, stars Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in a forced odd coupling, reminiscent of Godzilla vs. Kong and Midnight Run. The chemistry between the stars is evident, with Reynolds describing the film as like Fox dumped Wolverine, Disney picked him up, and Jackman ""has to play him until he is 90."" The movie is the most anticipated of the summer, proving a new future for both characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Reynolds' character, Wolverine, is a crackerjack quipster who constantly breaks the fourth wall, letting no one off the hook, including the studio. The jokes come at you so rapid-fire that one viewing is way too much. Levy, who co-produced and co-wrote the film, abandons his family-friendly filmography and fits comfortably into this particular universe, allowing the blue comedy to rip and the action to soar while ingesting heart and friendship into a winning mix that never seems off for a minute in the 127-minute running time.

I can attribute my bad viewing experience with this lady because the movie was basically pandering to anyone who has consumed a large amount of disney media, rather than actually flesh out a movie. The cameos were cool but yet were shoe-horned into the movie to make up for plot.I must say it had cool action scenes and I liked Wolverine and Deadpool's relationship dynamic. Word to the wise; wait a week before these movies come out so you don't sit with anyone as annoying and unlikable as the woman I sat next to.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
872,8.0,27-Jul-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is absolutely fantastic, a true rollercoaster that takes us on a hallucinatory journey at full throttle. The movie fulfilled what it promised, giving a huge breath of fresh air to the ""MCU"" even without making a significant change in the paths already traced, but rather by providing ""Marvel's"" return to the good movie's and giving a true experience to those who go to a movie theater to see a movie from this studio. This movie is not meant to be an epic record-breaker like ""Avengers Endgame"" was, but rather it is a ""Marvel"" event in the style of ""Spider-Man No Way Home"" because it is full of surprises, special appearances, lots of comedy and hilarious moments with the ""Deadpool"" signature, non-stop action with lot's of gore in the mix, great combat scenes, good special effects and lot's and lot's of fan service. In short, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" leaves us with a smile on our faces after the movie ends and when we leave the movie theater we want to see it again, that is the most important thing and it's been a long time since that happened, It should be noted that the movie is ""Deadpool"" in it's purest form like the previous ones, and it carries this movie in a fantastic way once again by the hands of ""Ryan Reynolds"" who makes this role his life, but the icing on the cake It's the return of ""Hugh Jackman"" as he once again plays ""Wolverine"" and once more, without exception, every time he appears, he ends up completely stealing the show, making this duo something truly special to remember later once again.

873,1.0,29-Jul-24,"I rated it at seven as you can see, as you can't argue with the movie was somewhat fun.That said it was also plodding, repetitive, villainless (Considering the villain herself was only thrown in there as a means to an end). This movie barely had any plot at all. One of the most super thin plots of any MCU movie.Clearly what it was about was trying to throw these two characters together and watching them Bromance through the whole thing while making repeated jokes about fox, pedos, masturbation, and other intense sexual innuendo, which is unfortunate because no doubt scores of young children are going to watch.Ryan Reynolds, of course, was a little over the top.Overall, a bit exhausting but funny if u r an adult and don't really care about the overall universe.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Thanks Ryan Reynolds for making Deadpool 1 & 2. Anyways, the film had to many ideas that weren't cooked all the way. It felt like a comedy of characters we know and somewhat plot and action.

875,9.0,2-Oct-24,"I recently watched Deadpool and Wolverine on Amazon Prime (yes, I paid for it, unfortunately), and while I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but compare it to the first two Deadpool movies, which I found much more entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I laughed-just not as much or as consistently as I did with the previous films. The humor felt a bit more restrained this time around, which isn't necessarily bad, but it didn't have that same relentless energy that made me love the original two.I went into this movie like a disciplined Puritan, avoiding all the teaser clips on YouTube to save myself for the full experience. In hindsight, this probably would've been better in theaters. It's one of those films, much like Oppenheimer, where I'm glad I saw it, but I'm equally glad that I won't need to see it again. Well, maybe I'll give the extended director's cut a go when that inevitably gets released, but that's likely it.Unlike the first two Deadpool films, which I can pick up and watch from any scene and still enjoy over and over, this one doesn't have that same rewatchability. I appreciated it for what it was, but it lacks that magic that would make me want to revisit it regularly. For fans, it's still worth the watch, but for me, it doesn't have that endless charm. Decent? Sure. Instant classic? Not quiteDo I think trolls and bots beef up the reviews online? Absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind that a bunch of trolls and bots were at work, boosting the reviews for Deadpool and Wolverine. You can spot them a mile away-overly glowing, repetitive comments that don't quite match the actual experience of the film. It's almost like they were written by people (or algorithms) who hadn't even watched it. While I did enjoy the movie, the rave reviews online seemed a bit... overhyped. It's pretty clear that the internet armies were out in full force to give it an artificial bump.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Now this third cash-in doesn't and the movie kind of sucks because of it. They must be best friends with, The Boys season 4 writers, or maybe they're just in the same cabal to ruin awesome IP's?

That will delight many people, it will be catharsis for others after recent struggles, and annoy some as well.The original Deadpool was a great satire of the superhero genre that the mcu was. This is more akin to an internet comment section comes to life.Ryan reynolds is having a blast, so is Hugh jackman, I enjoyed Emma corrin as well.The action suffers from being unimaginative. By this I mean every one fights the same way. It's been an issue in every superhero movie. There is no reason that Deadpool and Logan would fight the same.If you want to see a movie that repeats a few juvenile jokes for 2 hours, this is for you. Over the top violence for the sake of it, for you. A ton of sexual references, for you.I was just disappointed because I was hoping for than Ryan reynolds making dick jokes and three year criticisms of the mcu. The Deadpool franchise has the ability to take risks and plays to the lowest common denominator.This movie will absolutely delight many people which is evident by the score and multiple reviews. It just doesn't work for me due to being paper thin in just about everything and very repetitive with its jokes.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I realised there was a good chance I was going to have to give a film in the much despised (by me) MCU a 10/10 rating. I was just having such a good time with 'Deadpool' on his own unleashing brilliant line after brilliant line. Then 'Wolverine' came into the picture and the film quickly lost a lot of momentum.I'll never understand what people see in the 'Wolverine' character. My only guess is that Hugh Jackman is such an incredible and charismatic actor that he was enough to make people fall in love with an otherwise boring character. And usually I would just accept that and move on. But I'm Jackman's biggest fan and he does nothing for me as 'Wolverine'.The only other gripe I have with the film is the amount of time we have to spend watching the two leads fight, despite knowing that neither one can do any harm to the other one. Sure, some of the choreography is funny and it breaks up the story a bit, but man, could they not find some way to put some stakes into it?Otherwise I had a pretty good time with this one. 'Deadpool' was as hilarious as always, the music choices were terrific and the villain was decent. 8.5/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The writers here don't see superheroes that way, and the only thing overdone more than fight scenes is the number of F bombs. It gets to the point where you think you're watching an 80s high schooler's demo film who got the teachers approval to use profanity.

This was probably my favorite of the three Deadpool movies even with the pretty big plot holes and inadequate writing. I like the character appearances, they gave the audience those big oooohhhh, ahhhhhh moments. Overall in comparison to older Marvel Greats like Ironman and Captain America, this doesn't compare on a story level. However, everyone knows these Deadpool movies aren't meant to be taken seriously.

Well i'd say no way home did it better with the character development.The movie throw too much joke that are very segmented for a few people to enjoy, general audience are not gonna understand 40% of the joke.Cast is fire, hugh still rocks as wolverine!!!!, hugh and reynolds chemistry is perfecto.Emma corrin killed it as the villain. But i also add that the character suffer as alot of mcu villain that they are a one off character (die just like that). I needed more of her man :).The soundtrack is used very well on the movie.

898,7.0,31-Jul-24,"We all know that Marvel has been a little shaky lately with productions that are not at all captivating. Heartless films that seem like they are only there to compose a universe that always seeks to expand without caring about the story being told and only bringing uninteresting things. That said, how good it is to see a film that was made with the heart, with the sole intention of having fun and having a good laugh with what you are watching. Deadpool & Wolverine was everything we needed, a film that cares about telling its story and making you laugh with the (sensational) jokes that the film has, but those who have a certain amount of knowledge of the films before this one can enjoy it even more .Regarding the story, which isn't actually as incredible (which isn't supposed to be and that's a good thing) compared to the other two. And unfortunately, it felt a little dragged at times, especially in the second act of the film, where I felt that some scenes went on too long, especially involving certain characters introduced during the film. In addition to having missed a little how the film deals with old characters from the Deadpool franchise, as much as that is an opinion.The film's humor is IMPECCABLE, seriously, all the comedic moments in this film are really good, and especially the jokes involving the MCU. The same level of incredible can be said about the action scenes, which are very well directed, with many scenes in which the action is done in sequence, which makes the scene much more organic. The film's CGI is great in the film, although at one point or another it remains very fake and ugly, but in general it is very good... The first act of the film is personally the best part of the entire film, where all the funniest parts of the film are and ESPECIALLY its opening, which is honestly one of the best openings of a film I've seen in a long time. Its second act in this case has great scenes, but as I mentioned it has some scenes that are a little more drawn out involving a certain character in the film. And the third act where a series of frantic action scenes take place and which, yes, has a good conclusion to the story, although the solution to stop the threat in my opinion was a little... without consequences, I think. But it's not bad, just a little strange.The film's title characters are definitely the best thing about the film, seeing these two acting together and talking is a treat for fans of this character, and especially for fans of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, my God, how good it is to see this man returning to the character. Ryan Reynolds, as always, delivering everything as Deadpool, only this time with a much more personal and emotional objective in the film, meaning that his character is not just about the jokes, giving an even more emotional tone, which is enhanced by the character of Wolverine , which also has a heavier tone for his character. But these two together are incredible and VERY funny and all their scenes are incredible, because these characters along with their actors have an absurd level of charisma that always makes us want to pay attention to them all the time. There are several other characters in the film, such as the film's special appearances, which are many, and which are really surprising (some are more surprising, but surprising) and which help the film, being (mainly) in the comedy or even in the emotional weight of the film. Film. The antagonists/villains, however, are a slightly more complicated case, at various times they are very interesting to follow and have understandable motivations given who their characters are, for a few moments I found the interpretation of each of the actors to disconnect me a little from the film. , as much as I know that part of the film is to be that and I overlooked that point. Other characters in the film, like those in the previous films, don't appear much, but they're there, they're not really missed, but at least they're there.The separate songs for the film are sensational, my goodness, what a good thing to hear in the film, but not only are they good, they also make a lot of sense with the scenes in the film. The opening song says so. Not only that, but the film's entire original soundtrack is very good.--------//-------//--------Deadpool & Wolverine is a good comedy and action film that doesn't reinvent the wheel but does a well-done and fun job, which is what we've needed for a long time in this Marvel universe. The two title characters have an absurd chemistry and that's why every scene of interaction with them works perfectly. Definitely a film worth watching not only for its characters, but for its incredible comedy and action scenes in an uncompromising and very fun film, something we need more of in certain hero films nowadays.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
899,9.0,4-Aug-24,"I've seen many comments mentioning that the movie is great in so many aspects, but has no story. I think great part of it is because the villain story is so weak. It's that kind of villain that's just there to be beaten at the end. Her motive is so weak that you don't feel the real threat. Basically ""I love living in the void, so ultimately I want to kill all other realities so the void is the only one"". Even though it makes no difference for the if the others realities exists or not, since she only lives in the void.But ok, enough with the bad part (in my opinion)The movie is great. Not only because all of the obvious things (cast, nostalgia, cameos, soundtrack, etc), but mainly because it's a ray of hope that MCU can eventually get back on track. The movie specifically admits that the MCU is failing, that the F'd up.Of course there's a possibility that this is the money grabber so they can then continue making bombs like Shehulk and Marvels, but i don't think this will be the way.Deadpool is a delight for the fans.

Although it was easy to grasp the characters, it still felt weird. This movie markets itself to everyone, so I don't think I'm the only one who was confused as hell.

I even called jackman being in part 3 as me and my friends left the cinema after the brilliant second movie(I LOVE DUBSTEP! Lol). The first film was a good start, despite DP not having the multiple personalities that he has in the comics it was a great introduction to the character. The second one was for me one of the best comic book movies ever, great story, great action, great gags and of course, a great soundtrack! So the bar was already very high for this next one especially with Jackman back! It surpasses expectations! From the BRILLIANT opening credits to the final showdown it is pure brain candy! It has everything you'd expect from a DP movie and more! I won't give any spoilers but hurry up and see it before you hear any!

This film has single handedly saved the poor excuse that is Marvel these days, this film will do the numbers that endgame did and it deserves to! Endgame was a movie that was totally overhyped and just delivered plot hole after plot hole! This film nails everything it aims at! Jackman is (surprise surprise) brilliant as Logan as usual. The chemistry between him and DP will keep you laughing all the way through, and the violence, well, let's just say it's as graphic and as brutal as you'd expect from these two titans of comics!

Some of the jokes, particularly the ones involving Fox Network, fall flat. Too much of the movie occurs in The Void, and Professor X's sister is nowhere close to being intimidating or interesting enough to be the primary villain. The whole plot involving ""Anchor Beings"" and multiverses seems lazyMy last criticism is that I just didn't like seeing Jackman reprise his role as Wolverine after Logan. He had the best send-off to his character. Many people defend his return by noting that ""this is another Logan from another universe,"" but I find that nuance to be splitting hairs. The character in this movie is still Wolverine played by Jackman, and we see many references to Logan, including an appearance one specific character. Therefore, the movie does diminish Jackman's sendoff in Logan.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

With its fast talkin' filth (superbly written by Reynolds, Levy and three co-writers) and fourth-wall breakage (oft at Hollywood's expense) it maintains the 'Deadpool' rep of being Marvel's most irreverent, fun sub-franchise.

The joke quotient was tremendous with oodles of laugh out loud moments,(..one gag near the end was one of the funniest tings I've ever seen/ heard...still chuckling about it now..Hee hee hee..). The cameo's were fabulous and seemingly endless , one in particular,(..a certain Mr T..),was especially chucklesome, if you know anything about behind the scenes shenanigans and films 'development hell' of past years. All the actors were great but obviously the 2 Mains were quite Stupendous ,bringing all their experience and gravitas to their signature Roles.

924,8.0,3-Aug-24,"The film ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" can be described as a fantastic comedy satire taking place in the Marvel multiverseNevertheless, it cannot be denied that the movie is a rattling mix of banter, charisma and battle scenes that will not leave the audience indifferent. Deadpool, with his cheerful sarcasm and the destruction of the fourth wall, creates a unique contrast with the tough and laconic Wolverine, whose claws cut not only enemies, but also the ""thread of matter time"". Together, they turn the film into a bacchanal of humor and action, where every frame is filled with references and moments designed for omniscient millennial fans. The cartoon plot, intentionally exaggerated to the point of absurdity, allows the filmmakers to ridicule their own superhero seriousness.Each vivid scene and sparkling joke is a joy, but also a reminder of how far large corporations can go in exploiting our feelings and memories. The storyline is extremely sarcastic and is a satirical parody of the multiverse, which was parodied by Marvel managers with their bureaucratic myopia.The film also features multiple cameos and cameo appearances by other characters from the Marvel universe, many of whom have long been forgotten or pushed into the background. I was pleased with the appearance of ""Blade"", and yes, I don't see anyone except Wesley Snipes in this role!These ""returns"" delight and make you smile at the paradoxes of the multiverse, which is why the antihero calls himself a ""Paradox"".Constant intersections of time lines and ridicule of the complexity of the plot can confuse new viewers, but for devoted fans it will become a kind of intellectual game and an occasion for revisions and discussions, although I would not take the movie seriously at all, because the film has only one purpose - to entertain, and it succeeds, but not for me, well, that's my ""different worldview""However, despite all its advantages and success with a large audience, the film cannot hide from the shadow of its own success. He plays on nostalgia and the cult status of his characters, but his deep dependence on recognizable cliches and fanservice opens the door to possible criticism, but this pop icon is absolutely not afraid: the film laughs at itself in every scene.Ultimately, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" stay true to themselves, creating a fun and vibrant cinematic experience. This is a film for viewers who can laugh at their favorite characters, not forgetting that behind every comical moment there is a loving and appreciative audience. And although I perceive this picture with irony, like the characters Deadpool and Wolverine themselves, but I admit that such a decrease in the degree of seriousness only enhances its uniqueness.

I'm not that type of person - I sat stony faced throughout Deadpool & Wolverine, despite actually 'getting' some of the references: they simply weren't funny to me. And that's not a good thing when almost the entire film consists of fan-service and self-referential quips.It took me maybe ten minutes to realise that I had made a mistake in going to see this film: the opening gore-drenched fight scene was neither exciting nor funny. And the rest of the film followed suit, as Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) teams up with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to prevent corrupt Time Variance Authority employee Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) from deleting his dimension and thus terminating all of his loved ones.Over two hours of mind-numbingly repetitive cartoonish violence and utterly inane humour (I laughed just once, at the ass-slapping during the costume scene), this latest travesty from Marvel is hopefully another nail in the superhero coffin.2.5/10, rounded down to 2 for the ugly dog, who got more screen-time than a lot of the big stars.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

We got the new season of The Boys, we got Deadpool & Wolverine, and we are getting the last season of Umbrella Academy! This movie was a love letter to Fox's many movies about X-men and other superheros I don't want to spoil. The fighting scenes were so good they had a great coreography, they were bloody violent and gory I forgot this was Marvel! I could have gone with less Marvel Jesus jokes because they repeated them so many times and they were not funny but oh well. I also disliked the amount of sex jokes, way too many, someone needs to go to horny jail. This was yet another multiverse marvel movie that introduced new multiverse rules never before established. I was sad to see some actors missing that had previously been in Deadpool and Deadpool 2, would have been nice to see them. Oh and the whole Wolverine deal was not clear, like I get what happened, but how did it happen? Couldn't they show us, maybe using comics instead of actors so they did not have to pay them if that was the problem? Oh well, I got a poster for going so I'm not complaining, and I also bought 2 little Deadpool figurine.

Somehow, it just felt that despite the good intentions of the plot points, somehow, it was a tired narration of a story where you're banking on the love for the character rather than his/her journey. Logan's arc did have a lot of intensity and so did Deadpool's but somehow, what joined the arcs didn't somehow workout for me..Even the fight choreography, kinda felt tired by the time it was the last one- considering action has always been iconic in Marvel movies.I really liked the use of bus windows in the last fight though..But overall, who literally cannot like Deadpool and Wolverine together?

He has lost everyone close to him, turned to drink and wanted to die over and over. I felt this story was too lighthearted for his journey. (Even though it's a variant) They touched on it, they had the chance to deliver and I felt they missed it.

943,9.0,26-Jul-24,"I loved watching this film but it is kind of a hot mess. It takes on so much that it can't quite give anything it's full attention and, as a result, chinks in the armour do appear. Underdeveloped characters and plot lines mixed with story conveniences, pacing issues and sloppy exposition are peppered in throughout the film's two hour runtime. However, these flaws are likely just consequences of the filmmaker's completely understandable decision to prioritise humour and great moments above all else. They do certainly try to add some emotional stakes and weight to proceedings but it's so fleeting it all just comes off as a bit half-baked. You can't really blame the writers for rushing the story in order to get back to the fun stuff when the fun stuff is this good. Bloody action, surprising character appearances, an excellent soundtrack, countless one-liners and the most meta humour we've ever seen onscreen - it truly is great stuff. If you were to see an hour long highlights reel of the film's best moments before you saw them stitched together in the final product you'd swear it was the greatest superhero film of all time but, unfortunately, moments don't make a movie and the film those countless great moments are in sometimes fails to live up to the sum of its parts. Fortunately, we do find some focus at around the halfway point when the film really prioritises its greatest strength and that is the pairing of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. Their chemistry is thoroughly entertaining and well worth pulling Jackman out of superhero retirement to bring to the big screen. Of course there's plenty of cameos, easter eggs and surprises for fans but, surprisingly, the filmmakers were more taken with dusting off the old Fox/Marvel universe and giving it a proper send off than playing with their shiny new MCU toys. At times the film really does play out like Reynolds and director Shawn Levy emptied their Marvel toy chest onto their bedroom floor and smashed them together for two hours but it's clear they had a great time doing it and that joyous feeling definitely rubs off on the audience. It was also refreshing to see a Marvel film truly have fun with the multiverse tool after multiple attempts have criminally underused the concept. Overall, the film is hilarious, violent, fourth wall shattering and an extremely fun time at the cinema but if you're looking for an emotionally fulfilling superhero story, stick to Jackman's previous Wolvie outing in Logan.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The only consistency between scenes are meta references, and it makes the transition between scenes jarring. Also, the female antagonist seems shoehorned in. Aside from being a white, bald, angry British woman, it is a shallow all powerful fingery woman, who just happens to be the baddie.

946,8.0,28-Jul-24,"FOX's superhero franchise is the Burger King to MCU's McDonald's. Some of the FOX movies are amazing, but they never caught on as well as the MCU, and on top of that, there were some real stinkers among them.We started strong with X-Men and X2, dipped at X3, nosedived at Origins: Wolverine, a turn for the better starting with First Class and Days of Future Past, only to slowly nosedive again all the way to 2019's Dark Phoenix. Sprinkle in a couple of those nostalgic Fantastic 4 movies, a bad Daredevil, a worse Elektra, a few Punishers along the way, with Logan and the Deadpool movies being the last bit of saving grace for this ""franchise"".Why go through all that history of the FOX superhero films? Because despite the big, red MCU opening animation at the start of the movie, Deadpool & Wolverine is, at its core, a heartfelt good bye to that era of films. It's pretty ironic, that 7 months after the DCEU died, with its last movie being the big, wet fart that was Aquaman: Something Something 2, the FOX superhero franchise goes out on a surprisingly bitter-sweet note.Who knows? Maybe one day we'll see something similar for the MCU? With all its recent releases, it's actually becoming more and more likely.As for the movie, it's really funny. Deadpool's meta humor still holds up, but you can definitely tell it's lost a lot of its novelty. The action is the best it's ever been in Deadpool, though the CGI sometimes looks like a video game. Acting is surprisingly emotional, with Hugh Jackman giving an incredible performance.Cameos? They're great, and one cameo in particular was my personal favorite (though it wasn't much of a cameo). You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it.Music? Let's just say the opening of this movie is without a doubt the best opening of any FOX or MCU superhero movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Fan-service? Dude, it's the end of an era. You really think they're not going to give you everything you ever wanted? They do and it's glorious.So why an 8 and not higher? Ironically enough, what holds this (almost) FOX movie back is the MCU fluff. Once they start getting into the multiverse, focal beings, and all that other nonsense, I immediately lost interest. The movie's plot is framed within these ideas, sure, but that's all it really needed to be. Framing.I actually missed superhero movies that weren't a part of a bigger universe and didn't need to serve the practical purpose of expanding on the broader narrative of Phase 17 of a cinematic universe. Maybe now we'll get to appreciate those FOX superhero movies?But one question remains: if FOX's franchise is the Burger King to MCU's McDonald's, then what fast food place is the Sony superhero franchise? It's the dumpster behind a Church's Chicken.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

949,7.0,26-Jul-24,"Ok so just to make this clear, I'm just a casual moviegoer who decided to watch this movie because I had nothing better to do. I'm not a Marvel fan, and I haven't watched any of the X-men movies. With all this in mind, I was due for some pretty interesting surprises.What I can say from my experience, with all due respect, is that I could most easily relate this to No Way Home (one of the few Marvel movies I've actually seen). Although the story itself is kind of convoluted and ties into lore from several previous X-men and Marvel installments, most of the experience is carried by the non-stop action and satirical jokes by Deadpool, which filled the movie from start to finish. The reason I tend to compare this movie to No Way Home is because I think both are films that are designed primarily for the life-time fans of the franchises (hence the many cameos), however they tend to provide a solid and (to an extent) smooth experience for many casual moviegoers like me. If I had to pick my preference between the two I'd have to go with this one, just because of the amount of jokes that kept me rolling.Maybe your wondering the reason I only gave this movie 7 stars. Like I said, I'm not a Marvel fan and I haven't seen any of the other Deadpool films so of course I'm not going to understand every little detail. My primary criticism with the movie comes from the lack of explanation or clarification to just how insanely convoluted and twisted the entire premise of the movie is, let alone the hero's objectives. I guess I'm not fluent enough with the X-men lore to have understood many of the details regarding the characters and their universes, although I will say it definitely had an impact on my experience. I know it may seem a little mixed because this movie itself is technically a sequel (although I had no idea how interconnected the Deadpool franchise was with the X-men universe).I could go on about this and highlight more of my specific praises and criticisms with the movie but at the end of the day, I can appreciate it for what it's trying to be, even though it's not my kind of movie. I'd probably only recommend this to people who've at least seen enough Deadpool or X-men films to have a basic understanding of the worldbuilding. However, I still had a good time with it, and to anyone else who enjoys action-filled dark comedies I think you'll have a good time with it as well.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Even where it was within easy grasp in Logan's scenes of being a failure, it failed to reach the genuine depths we know the character is capable of when played by Jackman.The Cameos - 10/10 Let's be real, each one managed to top the last, having you giddy and on the edge of your seat, smiling like you were a kid again.The References - 12/10 In universe, out of universe, and real world inside jokes and references. They went above and beyond.This film managed to reach the intersection of ""Always Be Escalating"" (ABE) and finally skinning the Golden Goose. This is it it's over. This film finished at a 7/10 for me but came rocketing up to an 8/10 with the post credits scene.The homage to the fans, Fox, and the films that raised us.

951,6.0,29-Jul-24,Deadpool is back and brings together with him the wolverine. I can say that was a movie which had everything and maybe a little more than what we expected.I will refer to the breaking of the fourth wall where it is a main characteristic of the Deadpool movies but in this particular movie it was even nicer and funnier. I really liked the music choices in the movie as well. The good thing is that they kept deadpool and wolverine at the levels that these characters should be.

The more avid watcher not amused by the homosexual jokes and the gore action will find that the plot is non existant, ironically or not using a clasic marvelezque plot where the world is about to be destroyed and not giving it much attdntion, Disney know its +16 and for sure spent more energy making it edgy and cool.

I am not a marvel hater. I enjoyed no way home and in avengers endgame i was screaming for 5 mins continue when cap lifts the hammer.But good things doesn't last forever I guess and yeah trailer gives away way too much.

955,8.0,29-Jul-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is the highly anticipated crossover that fans have been clamoring for, and it does not disappoint. This action-packed, hilarious, and emotionally charged film brings together two of Marvel's most beloved antiheroes in a way that is both satisfying and fresh.From the outset, the film establishes its irreverent tone with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) breaking the fourth wall and making witty quips about the absurdity of the superhero genre. His comedic brilliance is perfectly counterbalanced by the brooding intensity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose gruff exterior hides a deep well of pain and loyalty.The plot kicks off when a new threat emerges, forcing Deadpool and Wolverine to team up despite their vastly different approaches to heroism. Their reluctant partnership is a source of endless humor, as Deadpool's reckless antics clash with Wolverine's disciplined, often grumpy demeanor. The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, their banter sharp and their camaraderie palpable.The action sequences are top-notch, showcasing both characters' unique abilities in spectacular fashion. Wolverine's brutal, visceral combat style is complemented by Deadpool's acrobatic, unpredictable fighting techniques. The choreography is fluid and dynamic, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats throughout.Director David Leitch, known for his work on ""John Wick"" and ""Deadpool 2,"" masterfully blends intense action with dark humor. The film's pacing is brisk, with a perfect balance of high-octane moments and quieter, character-driven scenes. Leitch ensures that both characters are given their due, exploring their backstories and motivations without slowing down the narrative.The supporting cast also shines, with standout performances from Zazie Beetz as the luck-manipulating Domino and Josh Brolin as the time-traveling Cable. Their interactions with Deadpool and Wolverine add depth and variety to the film, creating a rich tapestry of relationships and conflicts.One of the film's strengths is its willingness to delve into the emotional core of its protagonists. Wolverine's struggles with his past and Deadpool's battle with his own mortality provide poignant moments that resonate amidst the chaos. These character-driven elements elevate the film, making it more than just a mindless action flick.The visual effects are impressive, seamlessly integrating CGI with practical stunts. The film's aesthetic is gritty yet vibrant, capturing the essence of both characters' worlds. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of rock anthems and original compositions, enhances the film's energy and tone.In conclusion, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a triumphant blend of action, humor, and heart. It delivers on its promise of an epic crossover, bringing together two iconic characters in a way that feels both organic and thrilling. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the comics or just looking for a fun, entertaining ride, this film is a must-see.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Ladies, if you're not into these films, just go with your boyfriend trust me it will be worth it at the end! I cannot wait to go and see it again! Best deadpool film so far. Cinematic genius!

This one was fun to watch, and much better than Deadpool 2, but in my opinion the storyline and character development in this movie was very poor compared to the first.As others have pointed out, if you're a big comic book fan you will appreciate this movie more than you would otherwise because of all the callbacks to the universe and various cameos. However, I'm not that big of a comic book buff... I need an engaging story to keep me interested.Deadpool 1 had a better story, character development, and comedy and tied it all together cohesively. This one missed the mark in a big way when it comes to story and character development. Soooo many unanswered questions, and things happening that are important to the overall movie with zero backstory as to why they are taking place.With all that being said, I do recommend you watch it at least once because it was entertaining and worth the watch.

968,6.0,26-Jul-24,"When you think about dream team-ups in the Marvel Universe, Deadpool and Wolverine top the list. And in ""Deadpool & Wolverine,"" fans get everything they've been waiting for and more. This film is a glorious symphony of chaos, humor, and raw emotion, making it an absolute must-see for any comic book enthusiast.Plot & Characters:The story kicks off with Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) finding himself in a particularly sticky situation that, of course, only he could find himself in. Enter Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the grizzled, no-nonsense mutant with adamantium claws and a heart of gold. The dynamic between these two is electric, combining Deadpool's irreverent humor with Wolverine's gruff intensity.Reynolds and Jackman have an undeniable chemistry that leaps off the screen. Their banter is sharp, hilarious, and perfectly timed, making every scene they share a highlight. Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking antics are in full force, providing meta-commentary that pokes fun at everything from superhero tropes to the actors' own careers.Action & Visuals:The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular.

It was funny but felt abit like it was trying too hard, wolverine was a pleasant addition but in a world of milking movies for more then they're worth i feel like this is another victim of it. A trilogy felt unneeded especially after the first 2 movies were hilarious yet gut wrenching at the same time. I'm not saying it was a bad movie but it was bad from a trilogy stand point, if this was the first showing of deadpool as an anti hero of marvel it would've been amazing yet it paled in comparison to the other two and seemed to have added nothing to the main plot line.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Was it because its ""The movie that will save the MCU""?Truth be told, this movie didn't hold the ""Magic"" that the 1st 2 Deadpool movies did.My take: No more standalone Deadpool movies. That ship has sailed. Deadpool being in other MCU movies? Fine by me. I love how Ryan plays Deadpool; no other actor can ever be him but I think if another standalone Deadpool movie comes out, I will wait when it's on Disney+","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This movie was thoroughly entertaining during its entire runtime and it even brought some tears out of me. Arguably the best movie in the multiverse saga, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' brings the Marvel Cinematic Universe back to full form in the most iconic and batshit crazy way possible, with the help of a few jaw-dropping cameos. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds have all of the immaculate chemistry that was promised and it thankfully never missed a beat. Also, Emma Corrin's Cassandra Nova is a more-than-formidable antagonist that brings a rather rushed 3rd act to an epic conclusion. The laughs never stop, the action scenes are pulpy, and the 4th wall breaks are better than ever! To its credit, the film juggles a somewhat shaky plot fairly well with some much needed emotional weight and an overall good time that makes the pacing feel like a breeze.

Hugh is wolverine as long as we need him and i'm not complaining. Ryan was born for Deadpool and kills it this time around in both the comedy and seriousness.

X-Men, Fantastic Four, and even Daredevil were a big part of my childhood, and this film's goal was to remind you of those movies, whether they were good or bad, all in good fun. I feel like this film did a great job of sending off the Fox Marvel franchises while telling an entertaining story.The action scenes were awesome to watch! There is some bad CGI here and there, but nothing major enough to detract from the movie. Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds make an amazing and hilarious duo, keeping you entertained throughout their screen time. I was laughing the whole time.However, if you're not a fan of Marvel or didn't grow up watching the older Fox movies, you might feel a bit lost, which is understandable. From an entertainment standpoint, I would give this film a 10/10, but as a film, it's not quite that high.

981,8.0,29-Jul-24,"I had to chime in on this one. I've been following the MCU ever since 2016, and I've been a fan ever since. However, the period after the Infinity Saga ended up until now has been pretty horrible. Constant shows that make me want to die, most movies being mediocre slobs. Its all been pretty bad, and mostly because the head of Disney left shortly after the Infinity Saga finished, leaving the new head Bob Chapek to come on. Thankfully, Chapek has now been dethroned and Iger is back, and the first MCU movie in the new Iger era is awesome.Seriously, this movie is a must watch. It is constantly hilarious, the action is some of the most well choreographed I've seen in a long time, and the drama in the movie is intense (Hugh Jackman is, as always, an incredible actor, both comedic and dramatic).I'm not going to spoil anything, but know that there a handful of very big returns. The coolest part being that none of them were cameos - all were integral characters that had enough screen time to flesh them out.The movie also connects to the MCU (and a modicum of other franchises), leaving me satisfied as a fan.The story is, while ridiculous, very compelling and never had me anywhere near uninterested. Very creative, and very, very fourth wall breaking.I love this movie so much, and whoever is reading this, you absolutely need to give the movie a shot in the theaters.If I write for any longer I'll go on for a year, but if I have to end this review on mentioning something, I'll mention the music. Goddamn is the music incredible in this movie. Never have I seen licensed music used this well in a movie before.WATCH IT!Support this movie so we can tell Disney that we would like the MCU to stay at this quality.

If you have been with marvel since day 1 and enjoy all the films this is one for you as it does link past films with recent films and series.

Was fun to watch this in a packed theatre, 6pm on the opening Friday, and laugh along with a crowd that's invested, and understands the references. That communal experience is what cinema is all about.However, the film also represents a lot of the issues with modern superhero films:1.

992,9.0,26-Jul-24,"This is probably one of the most irritating movies that I have ever watched. The only thing I came anything close to liking is the intro scene and titles. Thats it. Everything else about this movie seemed completely meaningless. The jokes were forced, there is no real story. The action is something you have seen a thousand times over. Ryan Renolds is at his most annoying level. But Hugh Jackman saves the movie somewhat.Sets seem to be very claustrophobic for me everything is done in a very small place. This is something which I find common in all dead pool movies that the sets are really really small. It feels as if things were done on a budget which I really don't think is the case. So why the lack of quality?Some parts were funny though, thats the only positive. So in short a few laughs are all I got out of this movie. Apart from that it was a waste of time.Unless your a fanboy , just avoid this movie.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
993,1.0,4-Aug-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film that undoubtedly caters to the fans, bringing together two of Marvel's most beloved anti-heroes in a way that is both entertaining and visually spectacular. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is electric, delivering the witty banter and intense action sequences that fans have come to expect. The film is packed with Easter eggs, references, and nods to the comics, making it a treasure trove for die-hard enthusiasts.However, while the movie excels in fan service, it falls short in terms of storytelling. The plot feels disjointed and lacks the depth and coherence needed to fully engage the audience. The narrative often takes a backseat to the spectacle, resulting in a film that is more style than substance. Character development is minimal, and the motivations of the villains are underexplored, leaving the story feeling somewhat hollow.In summary, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a fun ride for fans who enjoy seeing their favorite characters in action, but those looking for a strong, cohesive story may find it lacking.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
994,1.0,27-Jul-24,"Oh boy, where do I start with ""Deadpool & Wolverine""? Imagine taking a ride on a rollercoaster operated by Deadpool himself, with Wolverine as the grumpy but badass safety inspector. That's pretty much what this movie feels like!First off, the cast is a superhero dream team. Ryan Reynolds is back as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool, delivering snarky one-liners with the precision of a surgeon (or maybe a very sarcastic butcher). Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine, bringing his signature gruff charm and adamantium claws. The chemistry between these two is like a buddy cop movie on steroids-if those steroids were also laced with caffeine and a dash of insanity.The movie kicks off with an opening scene that's both gritty and groovy, setting the tone for the madness to come. Marvel fans will rejoice at the sheer volume of in-your-face humor, action-packed sequences, and eye-popping visuals. It's like the filmmakers decided to throw caution to the wind and just have a blast, and boy, does it show.The plot is... well, it's there, somewhere between the explosions, witty banter, and unexpected cameos. Speaking of which, keep an eye out for some fantastic surprises, including appearances from past X-Men villains and a few new faces that will leave you grinning. The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine is a special treat, offering a fresh and fierce twist amidst the usual superhero fare.Now, let's talk about some standout moments. Without giving too much away, there's a scene where Deadpool and Wolverine team up against a horde of enemies that's both ridiculously over-the-top and incredibly satisfying. It's like watching a ballet of violence, choreographed by someone who decided that subtlety is for wimps.The humor is exactly what you'd expect from a Deadpool movie, with plenty of fourth-wall-breaking jokes and meta-commentary. There are jabs at Disney and 20th Century Fox, and even a few self-deprecating digs at the superhero genre itself. Ryan Reynolds' comedic timing is impeccable, and Hugh Jackman proves he can do comedy just as well as he does drama.But it's not all jokes and explosions. There are moments of genuine heart, particularly in the interactions between Deadpool and Wolverine. Beneath the layers of sarcasm and bravado, there's a surprisingly touching story about friendship and redemption. Who knew that a guy in a red spandex suit and a grumpy Canadian with claws could make you feel all the feels?Visually, the film is a feast for the eyes. The special effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are brilliantly executed. Whether it's a high-speed chase or a brutal hand-to-hand combat scene, the choreography is on point, and the cinematography captures every punch, kick, and snarky grin in glorious detail.If there's one gripe, it's that the movie occasionally feels like it's trying to do too much. With so many characters, subplots, and jokes crammed into the runtime, it can be a bit overwhelming. But then again, that's part of its chaotic charm. It's like being invited to a wild party where you don't know anyone, but you end up having the time of your life anyway.In conclusion, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a wild, hilarious, and action-packed ride that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's everything you'd want from a team-up between these two iconic characters and more. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just looking for a fun movie night, this film is sure to leave you entertained and possibly craving chimichangas.So grab your popcorn, buckle up, and get ready for a superhero spectacle that's as irreverent as it is epic. Just remember, you're not ready. But that's okay-neither are they, and that's what makes it so darn fun.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

998,9.0,13-Aug-24,"""Wolverine and Deadpool"" (2024) emerges as a cinematic tour de force, deftly amalgamating the brooding gravitas of Wolverine with the irreverent flamboyance of Deadpool, culminating in a tapestry of narrative complexity and stylistic bravura. The film's directorial prowess is palpable from the outset, orchestrating a symphony of visual and thematic elements that coalesce into a harmonious yet paradoxical unity. Hugh Jackman, reprising his iconic role as Wolverine, delivers a performance suffused with a palpable depth, his portrayal resonating with an undercurrent of existential angst juxtaposed against stoic resilience. His embodiment of the character is a masterclass in subdued intensity, each glance and gesture laden with unspoken history and inner turmoil. Contrariwise, Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is a kinetic force of nature, his sardonic wit and meta-textual commentary punctuating the narrative with effervescent levity. Reynolds navigates the labyrinthine corridors of humor and pathos with dexterity, ensuring that Deadpool's antics, while irreverent, never devolve into frivolity. The screenplay is an intricate mosaic, weaving together multifarious strands of plot and character development with meticulous precision. It navigates the treacherous terrain of blending two disparate tonal landscapes, ensuring that neither character's essence is subsumed by the other. The dialogues are imbued with a lyrical quality, oscillating between poignant introspection and razor-sharp banter, thereby maintaining a dynamic equilibrium. The cinematography warrants particular commendation; the chiaroscuro lighting techniques employed accentuate the dichotomy between the protagonists, with Wolverine's scenes bathed in somber hues and Deadpool's sequences awash with vibrant palettes. The action set pieces are choreographed with balletic grace, each confrontation a visceral ballet of brutality and finesse. The auditory landscape of the film is equally compelling, with a score that traverses the spectrum from hauntingly melancholic to exuberantly bombastic. The sound design intricately layers ambient noises, diegetic sounds, and musical motifs, crafting an immersive auditory experience that complements the visual spectacle. However, the film is not devoid of imperfections. Certain narrative arcs, particularly those pertaining to ancillary characters, are afforded cursory exploration, rendering them somewhat two-dimensional in the grand tapestry. Additionally, the pacing occasionally falters, with segments of the second act meandering into expository quagmires that momentarily derail the momentum. Nevertheless, these minor foibles scarcely detract from the film's overarching triumphs. ""Wolverine and Deadpool"" is a testament to the alchemical potential of cinematic storytelling, where meticulous craftsmanship, stellar performances, and audacious vision coalesce into an opus that transcends the conventional boundaries of the superhero genre. It invites viewers into a realm where humor and tragedy, action and introspection, chaos and order coexist in a delicate ballet, challenging and rewarding in equal measure. In summation, the film stands as a paragon of genre-blending artistry, offering a multifaceted experience that lingers in the psyche long after the credits have rolled.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

You go to cinema to just enjoy your time and have unfiltered fun. Not to change the world again. We need more movies like this. Seen it twice already and still could easily go 3rd. Masterful, but to be honest - Marvel will have hard time to keep such a high level going forward. Also if ever they decided to do Deadpool 4, it also will be very hard to reach that level again.As Deadpool says in the film ""Let's give the audience what they are paying to see"" and I fully agree - they delivered on all promises.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1001,9.0,29-Jul-24,"This review is about the 3D version, but you can catch the normal version everywhere.Deadpool and Wolverine: an odd couple, if there ever was one. Deadpool & Wolverine throws the wise-cracking Merc with a Mouth and the brooding, clawed loner together for a wild ride. It's a mix of laughs, action, and surprising heart that mostly hits the mark.Reynolds and Jackman have undeniable chemistry. Reynolds is in his element, firing off jokes like a machine gun. But it's Jackman who steals some scenes with a vulnerability we don't often see from Logan. Their very mature-rated banter is gold, and it carries the movie through some of its weaker moments.The action is a rollercoaster. Some sequences are pure adrenaline, with the 3D adding a cool dimension. Others feel a bit too chaotic. But when you've got two guys who can cut through steel with their bare hands, you expect some explosions.The humour is spot on. Deadpool's fourth-wall breaking antics are as sharp as ever, and the movie is packed with funny pop culture references. But it's the buddy comedy vibes between Deadpool and Wolverine that really shine. You can't help but laugh at their constant bickering.It's not perfect, though. The story is pretty standard superhero fare, and there are a few slow parts. Plus, while 3D is cool and increases the feeling of immersion, in my opinion, it's not necessary to enjoy the movie. There's nothing game-changing about it.Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine 3D is a fun popcorn flick. It's not high art, but it's entertaining. If you're a fan of these characters, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't expect to leave the theatre pondering deep life questions. And remember, this one is definitely not for children.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1007,1.0,3-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine will go down as the highest box office earner for R rated movies of all time, but it's probably the worst of the trilogy, that's the MCU tax at work.Let me start by saying that, this movie probably has my absolute favorite opening scene in MCU history, might be recency bias, but Deadpool absolutely murdering TVA agents while doing a choreography for N'Sync Bye Bye Bye is perfect, hilarious from start to finish, couldn't stop smiling, and it's just feels right in a Deadpool movie.After that things get VERY shaky, I might have to rewatch the first 2 films, yes the first 2 movies did at times halt the flow pacing of the movie to joke around, but this one, wow. With jokes that take too long, after you think it's done, no... there's more. And once it's done you remember, oh right, these guys are actually doing something. It wasn't pretty, sometimes it worked, but sometimes, it was just too distracting.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are having the time of their lives, their dynamic is so good, and it just keeps the movie going, hope Matthew MacFayden enjoys the pay check, because it felt like he didn't want to be there, and Emma Corrin was great with what she was given, unfortunately they wanted more jokes and cameos that actually building a compelling villain.The cameos were good to be fair, it was great to see some of these, but Henry Cavill?! YES, that was awesome, I'm shocked Marvel managed to keep most of these under wraps, guess that's what happens when Tom Holland isn't part of the movie.Story wise, there's a movie in here, a really amazing one, that just gets a bit hidden by all fan service that it tries to do.

To me, this shows in the middle of the movie, because it seems to drag on constantly with references and Easter eggs. It almost feels like filler to extend the runtime.

Please remember the first two, not really great or strong stories.. cute and memorable momenta, but not really great stories.. But they don't have to be.. The Merch With a Mouth is a fourth wall breaking, funny, invincible former special force fighter.. it was never ever about a great story.. it was about fan service, made by a great actor with enthusiasm for the character, nothing more, nothing less..And this movie delivers exactly that..Regarding my review here and why I give it a 9/10 is because it actually exceeded my expectations a lot.. It's Disney I was afraid of getting hit by the lately politics of a Disney, but I wasn't.I haven't felt so good in a long time, especially after leaving the cinema, I'm writing this fresh off this feeling..

1016,9.0,1-Aug-24,"So in many way I think this may be the best Deadpool movie. However it has some issues that end up hurting it.Let's start out with the good.Having Wolverine is just very fans dream. The interaction between DP and Wolverine are perfect and what you would expect. Especially when they fight as no one ever really wins since they are more or less unable to die. The amount of cameos is mind blowing and had us nerds gleefully shouting. As did many of the very meta jokes! And of course having the TVA was just perfect given DPs multiverse, 4th wall breaking nature.The bad? All of the above sort of.Let's be clear, unless you seen the old X-Men/hero movies before the MCU and unless you read alot of comics. MUCH of the comics and cameos just aren't going to do anything for you. This also means so many jokes are going to go over people's heads. And this is an issue because if your movie depends on all this knowledge, cameos...etc, then you may have to consider how good the movie really is. Fan service is great, but it doesn't always mean a movie is going to be great.Storywise it's actually kind of weak. The villain(s) were ok, admittedly ""she"" was terrifying, but also felt like she wasn't in the movie much. And the other villain, he was kinda funny but again, not really scary per say. And overall their stories weren't exactly deep. And in many ways the story became kind of confusing. How did certain people get in the movie? Which earth where they from? When did they become part of the Marvel movies? Even Deadpools timeline earth is sort of confusing. Granted I've always said with a multiverse, if your not careful, it can makes thing more complicated then they need to be and create issues.One good example is the DP movies we see an older X-men and then in another movie was see the younger (First Class) X-Men. How can this be given the DP movies take place after each other and the timeline for the younger/older X-Men is a period of decades. Granted some of it is inside jokes, but it can be confusing if you think about it.And this movie REALLY upped everything. Including the one liners. And while many were hilarious, it often felt endless and almost overly forced to push a joke every 5 seconds. It's DPs nature, but it also almost goes so much that its exhausting.So in the end if you KNOW the past of the Marvel/Fox movies and some comic stuff, you will love this movie and get most of the jokes. If not, you may find alot of the ""amazing"" or ""funny"" moments lacking.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The story line is the best the writers can do with so much on the check list to entice movie goers to get back into the MCU brand loyalty. Rating is brought up by the cameos, but the rating was brought down by the Disney brand: To elaborate, the Disney brand has always been about feel good ending with life a lesson. Considering this is an adult movie, the let's all feel good message is exhausting. There were a handful of scenes that were forced to be dramatic, but it just doesn't feel genuine. Action is overwhelmingly redundant. There are several jabs at real life and movie characters that were relatively easy to catch. And there are many more repetitive, alternative lifestyle jokes that are simply played out after two installments. Even though this was enjoyable, I would not want to sit through it again any time soon, hence the six out of ten rating. Worth the watch, yes as six is still better than average.

The relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is dynamic and priceless, two different worlds in an epic team up. One is serious, haunted by the past, and the other is frivolous and rarely stops talking, and the way he raises tensions and is always ready to stab between them, it is witty and fascinating to watch. The humor is fortunately not filtered and delivered with total freedom, rude, playful, rude as it should be, and the cameo roles are shocking and unpredictable, the moment you see them, you get a great thrill and joy, because you are always kind of longed and wondered if they would ever come to MCA and get their minutes of fame in the action scenes, we saw them in action, which is a dream come true. While the action is one of the best in recent times, full of brutality, bloodiness, sharpness, where you can see and felt punches and gunshots, mixed with acrobatics and martial arts, is only a bigger plus with some literal parts, you think of the way they were performed, they look like they were ripped out of a comic book, the very emptiness is in the manner Mad Maxa is luxurious, full of challenges and full of masterful easter eggs, the villain who is connected to Xavier is effective and not an easy task and when he is in the frame with the heroes there is no shortage of tension, while the soundtrack and their pursuit of musical classics only make the film even better.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1025,1.0,1-Aug-24,Wonderful wrap up for the trilogy!!! While I'd love Deadpool to continue to have movies...I really feel like this one nailed everything (it will be so hard to beat). Ryan brings all the same comedic beats from the first 2 movies. That intro dance number at the beginning is now my favorite scene out of all 3 movies. Hugh & Ryan have such an incredible bro-rivalry it works well!I love all the cameos & Easter eggs - they hit all the right feels. The story was like the other Deadpool movies in that even though it seems crude and irreverent it has a ton of heart. I'd happily go watch this again in the theater (and I don't go often anymore what with how much everything is).It was a great date movie.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1027,1.0,27-Jul-24,5 out of 5 stars.Deadpool and Wolverine is an awesome superhero film which brings these two characters into the mcu. Deadpool is still a potty mouth and film is still bloody and gory. Character does not lose his sense his humor with the disney merger. Shawn Levy did a great job in bringing these characters. And delivering justice.Plot is great. About the tva recruiting Deadpool to help save a timeline with another agenda in play. The script has plenty of references and humor to keep the jokes rising. The action sequences is bloody fun. The cast ensemble is great and plus the surprise cameos. The soundtrack is fun. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman back into the role and hope he continues further with the character.Can not say much more without spoiling. It is best to see for yourself. It is one awesome film in the mcu and cant wait to see the next film.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1028,8.0,11-Aug-24,"There was a time movies gave us the fans what we like. Not everyone was successful at that. But they tried. Then we all have to go through several years of movies telling us what to like and what not to like, instead of giving us what we like.Deadpool & Wolverine took us back to the times when movies were made for the fans. And it did a great job out of it. Comedy was on point with few of heart felt moments. Movie was no way perfect. The reasons for why Deadpool needed to bring back Wolverine is flimsy at best. But it doesn't hurt the enjoyability of the movie.This movie was pure unadulterated fun for the long time fans of Marvel superhero movies without messages or pandering to the fans.It is just a love letter for fans from all the Marvel superhero movies.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1029,1.0,24-Jul-24,"It's Wednesday evening and we're in one of the very first screenings of Deadpool & Wolverine in Australia.The theatre is packed and you can tell we have an expectant audience. Strap in and let's see what this film is all about.For a start, it is definitely a Deadpool movie - all the usual fourth wall chatter, profanity and wisecracks, gratuitous glorious violence, and wonderful choreography. As a Deadpool movie, it's better than the second movie and only slightly less good than the first one.Pan out to the bigger picture and that's where the gaping cracks appear. By trying to say goodbye to Fox and say hello to Disney/Marvel, this movie falls flat for me.Yes, there are cameos from the Fox Universe. And with the first one (intentionally chosen to fool you, say no more), your hopes start to rise that this could be epic. Then you realise that the roster is thin and none of the iconic characters are going to show up, and your hopes fade.The movie becomes an overblown, too try hard, too smug, and a self-referencing bloody mess. You have to be a mega-fan of Ryan Reynolds to enjoy this properly - it's less Deadpool the character and more ""Look at me, Ryan Reynolds, playing Deadpool"". It's hard to watch. Look closely and you'll barely recognise a script of any substance at all. It's whisker-thin and you end up feeling like it's a one-liner stand-up show crossbred with a Greatest Hits nostalgia review as opposed to a movie that heralds the start of a fantastic new world of Marvel.And just in case you didn't work that out, the end credits scene hammers this home as obviously as possible and that left us feeling even more deflated.I love superhero movies and it's been an incredible 20+ years, through the hits and misses, of both Marvel and DC. I feel blessed to have grown up with the comics and then, as an adult, see those pages come to life through the amazing advances in technology.However, I simply don't know how Marvel is going to hit gold going forward. DC is possibly about to blow us away with their reboot of their universe. I fear Marvel is screwed and the current slump will continue unless heads roll at the top.I give this 5/10 because as a Deadpool movie, it's fun. But, you can't ignore the fact this is supposed to lead us into a new, combined and expanded universe. Based on this, it is a steaming pile of Dodo excrement.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1030,9.0,30-Jul-24,"I haven't had this much fun watching a Marvel movie ever! Great movie with excellent humour and amazing action.There is a chuck full of Easter eggs all over this movie with great call backs to 80s, 90s and 2000s. It is a long drive through memory lane but it is done in a way that the journey is supremely entertaining. The cameos are well selected and meaningful.The entire movie theater was giggling from start to end but also there were some deep moments with meaning in it as well.The acting from the two leads were great but the side characters did a really good job as well.It is surely a must watch!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1031,1.0,1-Aug-24,"I mostly appreciate classic Hollywood and European cinema, dramatic and existential films. I loved X-men as a child, however, couldn't vibe with Marvel and DC or any super-heroes when they were extremely popular 10 years ago, gave a try with ""Civil war"" (2016) and hated it. Never wanted to see Deadpool 1 or 2. Lately I became more open to different tastes of films and decided to give a try for ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" because of good reviews and Hugh Jackman. Was skeptical at first but found myself laughting, smiling, chuckling and even aww-ing truly from my heart. This meta-humor finally made sense to me. Would recommend for everyone. Still 8/10 is much higher them my expectations.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1032,1.0,28-Jul-24,"I always have a great time watching the Deadpool movies and not only was this no exception, this may have been the most fun I've had yet.The way Ryan Reynolds has absolutely perfected his version of Wade/Deadpool is marvelous. Yes, pun intended. Every line, every ounce of the delivery, every twitch and wink and smirk of body language is in the name of comedy and serving this one-of-a-kind not-hero hero. I could watch Deadpool do and say anything and likely find it hilarious.The Easter eggs and surprises and reveals in this movie were next level. I am not going to say anything more than just expect the unexpected. Wolverine is the tip of the iceberg.Was the plotline the best executed? Not really. Choppy and a bit muddled in parts. But the rest of the movie makes up for anything the storyline may lack. You can still thoroughly enjoy this movie, even through some plot holes or head scratching moments. That's a testament to the character Ryan has built and the effort put into giving the audience a great fan experience.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

They begged me to give this one a chance, and I'm so glad I did.I laughed through the whole thing. Even the fighting scenes, when I usually get bored, kept me entertained. The use of fun pop music during the very gory fighting, as well as Reynolds and Jackman's quips, were brilliant.Reynolds was made for playing Deadpool. The constant jokes and chatter, with the occasional sentimental moment, gives the impression that you're basically watching him be himself, with a superhero suit and powers. He's very natural and funny as always.This really solidified to me that Hugh Jackman can do anything. I've been a fan of his since he was a very young Curly in Oklahoma! He played the perfect straight man to Reynolds's goofiness.The inside jokes got me more than anyone in the theater when we watched it.I'd recommend this movie to everyone. If I can enjoy it, as a superhero hater, anyone can.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Definitely the funniest marvel movie and maybe one of the best marvel movies of all time. I cant tell you the last time i laughed that hard at any movie in general, much less a new marvel movie. With marvel on a serious decline, this might be what marvel/disney needed to take back off. Deadpool and wolverine is definitely a must see and easily one of the best releases this year.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It was super entertaining from the very first minute to the credits. I really liked it, the chemistry between the whole cast on screen was extremely interesting and good. I found the movie a little rushed though, but it's not a big of a deal, the comedy kept it really fresh and surprisingly funny. Anyways, go watch it, it's not a waste money, you will laugh a lot and you will be surprised by the chemistry of Deadpool and Wolverine!

I could stayed for 24 hours straight just watching Deadpool and Wolverine fight with each other and with each other, and I wouldn't have been bored for a minute.So many old and new characters, so much nostalgia, and so many jokes my stomach still hurts! It was such an amazing movie to watch, and once again it didn't disappoint. Deadpool is indeed keeping the MCU alive, and the way it featured the multiverse, was simply great!I think Disney should keep Deadpool as it is, an original masterpiece with plenty of jokes and the best marketing that ever existed. I would absolutely rewatch the movie when it comes out on Blu-Ray, and I would also love to see Deadpool and Spider-Man in the near future.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1043,9.0,29-Jul-24,"Will immediately start by saying that this is one of the most useless movies ever produced, it's not supposed to have an oscar worthy story/plot or whatever, but there's really no reason for this to exist except the fact of putting Logan & Wade side by side...and that's it, there's no plot, no purpose, no nothing. After ""Logan"" it's truly difficult to watch marvel movies since they're all inferior to that one. Wade is supposed to be a comic relief, but here everyone is a damn comic relief character, well except for Jackman, he's always great in this role. It was good to see him wear the costume. All of the cameos are absolutely useless and out of place, 0 momentum (except for Blade/Gambit, those were actually cool) the whole TVA thing is absolutely childish and ridiculous, just an excuse to do whatever they want with this universe. The movie is entertaining and funny nonetheless, it is well done from a technical point of view, but except from that.... there's truly nothing to see in this, and this comes from a guy who absolutely loves both Deadpool & Wolverine, but this is a cashgrab guys, nothing else!!! PS. The villain is totally forgettable.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1044,1.0,12-Aug-24,"I realize that they have been in a movie before, depicting the same characters, though with Deadpool he was sort of the same character. Now, however, we get to see the highly comedic version with Wolverine who is still a bit grouchy and do we see some blood spatter. So, it all was great for me as the first Deadpool we got to see how easily a Colossus can be done correctly, in the second how easily a correct Juggernaut can be and in this one, we get to see how easily it is to have Wolverine in the correct outfit! In fact, it was probably the easiest to do. So, I had a good time, have not been to the movies since The Batman and my comic book streak is alive, but I really saw this more for Ryan and Hugh. Did not care for the Marvel cinematic universe, they kind of said they did not need me as a fan anyways, but I still came to see this one because of the wacky comedy, glorious violence and the multiple cameos, so I was not disappointed.So, the story has Deadpool in a bit of a rut as he tries to do something to really shine. He tried to join the Avengers and got shot down and was told by Happy Hogan (who I am sure they wanted Tony Stark for this) to aim lower in life so Wade becomes a very bad car salesman. However, his friends throw him a birthday party that does cheer him up, and then he learns that his universe is about to become extinct. Now he most don the Deadpool costume and find Wolverine, because it was the death of Wolverine in his universe that set its death in motion. Unfortunately, they get sent into The Void, which is like a garbage dump of people run by Charles Xavier's sister who is very eccentric. They must team with other superheroes that were tossed aside and make their way back to Wade's universe before it is destroyed!Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynold's are great together and make this an enjoyable film. The plot is understandable, if not all that important as it is multiverse stuff, and Deadpool himself craps over the multiverse within this movie! Hugh looks great, the guy knows how to look good for his role and it will be nearly impossible to replace him with another actor, as you just associate him with it. Ryan is, of course, very funny and he just does a very good Deadpool. The villain, Nova was good as well, so crazy and kind of cute at the same time. I will not mention the other characters in this, because I do not want to spoil if for anyone, I knew of one, but more than a couple surprised me.So, this was a nice time at the movies. I suffer from severe depression so I literally cannot see films that have really depressing moments and such. This one had some serious scenes here and there, but thankfully Wade is known for his mouth so it pulls everything back into the light very quickly. My mother went with me to see this and even she really enjoyed it, she especially liked Dogpool....","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1045,1.0,29-Jul-24,"We watched the first 2 Deadpool's, and the Wolverine spin off movies to get ready ... we loved watching them to get ourselves ready!!I'm going to cover allot in this so get ready ... we enjoyed it and laughed allot. The adult innuendo references were hilarious especially if you expect to hear it and see it. Ryan REYNOLDS was perfect as Deadpool. Sarcastic, smart ass, perverted and flat out doesn't give a darn about what he says or does. Cause he's so warped. He says everything that we're thinking but don't have the courage to say. Especially his talking to the audience. Loved his character. Wolverine/Logan was extremely excellent. I loved his angry, drunken and aggressive personality, like he didn't want to be bothered so his anger would get the best of him.I love the marvel comic series and the picture series. BUT I will admit once the whole multiverse storyline gets into play that's when it gets confusing. Blending in all these wolverines and all these avenger characters into the X-men universe wasn't necessary. They shouldn't really blend in the two universes. Just like when they blended Alien and Predator. Now if they made a spin off movie, completely having nothing to do with the original story lines or not even effecting the storyline. If they did that, I would make a X-men vs Avengers movie, at least a 2hrs and 45 min movie. Then have them team up and face the main bad guy. That'll be worth it. But we do love the joke references to the marvel universe and to the movie industry. Also the avenger references were hilarious. Deadpool can really get under your skin. Lol. Gambit character was unnecessary being portrayed by Channing Tatum. It definitely wasn't a good fit for him. He was better in 21 jump street. Besides WASNT Gambit supposed to get his own film??Action sequences were 200% on point. The CG sequences were very on point. This movie was along time coming and expected. It was worth the wait. 10/10. The action sequences of Deadpool vs Wolverine was excellent. I already knew Wolverine was going to kick Deadpool's ass.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1051,1.0,26-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is a good product born of the cyclical and cynical nature of modern Hollywood: it mocks the crap out of 20th Century Fox in a satisfying manner and also riffs on the overdrive of craziness that is the multiverse trope in superhero movies since Spider-Verse. And Ryan Reynolds knows fully well he can do whatever the heck he feels like doing because Deadpool is THAT self-aware and refreshing a character who doesn't spare anyone the mercy of mockery.The MCU is certainly in need of some creative revitalising and the film runs with that too; it does this and reveres the Fox-era X-Men films against a narrative backdrop that ACTUALLY does justice to the whole 'vs' concept of a crossover film where two icons fight to the 'death'. Deadpool & Wolverine works because it does what films like Batman v Superman and the Alien vs Predator films failed to realise: being uncomplicated upfront FUN, playing to the strengths of their characters.Deadpool & Wolverine is simply good fun at the movies, and it's what the MCU needs instead of being a constant barrage of sequel-bait material. Yes we like sequels, but they still have to be earned all the same.Deadpool & Wolverine gets 4/5 stars. 8/10 IMDbs. It's the kind of self-contained fun movies strive to be.

This film is the perfect blend of action, comedy, and unapologetic irreverence, delivering exactly what it promises and more. From the very first scene, it's clear that this isn't your typical superhero movie. The film masterfully combines outrageous action sequences with a relentless barrage of crude humor, all of which is brilliantly executed to keep you entertained from start to finish.The humor is sharp, witty, and often hilariously inappropriate, making Deadpool a standout in a genre that often plays it safe. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as the wisecracking anti-hero, bringing the character to life with a mix of charm, sarcasm, and just the right amount of insanity. His performance is both hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt, adding depth to a character who could have easily been one-dimensional.One of the film's most entertaining aspects is its use of ironic music during the action scenes. The juxtaposition of violent, high-octane sequences with upbeat, often cheesy songs creates a unique and memorable experience that sets Deadpool apart from other action comedies. It's a brilliant touch that adds to the film's overall tone of playful chaos.If you've ever been a 13-year-old boy-or if you just enjoy a good dose of raunchy humor-you'll love this movie. Deadpool isn't afraid to push boundaries, break the fourth wall, and poke fun at the superhero genre itself. It's a wild, irreverent ride that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still delivers plenty of heart amid the mayhem. Whether you're a fan of the comics or just looking for a good laugh, Deadpool is a must-see. It's pure, unfiltered entertainment at its best.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Each appearance is a delightful nod to the broader Marvel lore, making the film feel like a true celebration of the franchise.Hugh Jackman's physical transformation in ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is nothing short of spectacular, with his impressive abs stealing several scenes throughout the film. These moments not only underscore Wolverine's strength and resilience but also showcase Jackman's unwavering dedication to the role. Additionally, for the female audience, Jackman's remarkable chiseled abs provide an extra layer of visual enjoyment, enhancing the overall appeal of the movie.Also the film's music selection, especially in the opening scene and during fight sequences, is exceptional, enhancing the (funny) mood and elevating the action to new heights.The end credits scene is a stroke of genius, leaving the audience in stitches.In conclusion, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a phenomenal film that excels in every aspect. It delivers breathtaking action, a compelling story, and a perfect balance of humor and heart. The film stands as a tribute to Wolverine's legacy while also carving out its own unique place in the superhero genre. With stellar performances, especially from Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and a slew of exciting cameos, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a must-watch for any Marvel fan. It's a film that entertains, moves, and leaves a lasting impression.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

They used ""Like a Prayer"" spectacularly. The amount of man love and freely given made my heart happy. Loved it. Would pay to see it again and will certainly buy it when it comes out.

I don't know if you've noticed, but most of the highly-anticipated movies since Corona have been a letdown.This is another of those. Apart from impressing Ryan Reynolds himself, this movie does little in the scope of superhero movies or action movies. It's basically the same old trope of messed-up guy trying to make sense of his existence after losing someone important and then finding himself by doing something useful. This isn't a plot. It's kindergarten story-telling.As much as I dislike 3D, I wanted to see if Ryan could bring something new to the table. I accept that was my mistake. Ryan has typecast himself into the external monologue-nitwit that Deadpool has become. He's like that ex you still have feelings for, then she starts talking, and you realize why you left.Sure, if you like Ryan, this movie was probably like the icing on the cake. For every line that Wolverine delivers, Deadpool has a couple dozen of his own. It's ironic, that his suit doesn't actually have a mouth.I'm sure you're thinking that I dislike this movie just because Deadpool talks too much. And you're right, but I also dislike it because it's like the overpriced popcorn and coffee you get at theaters: Sure it's tasty and looks great, but it's pure indulgence and I'm not falling for that.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Reynolds once again crushed his role, same with Jackman - they paired well together and kept the whole thing Deadpool style with witty humor throughout the movie.Supporting cast was great as well, and even had more cameos than probably the previous movies. Not sure how far they will continue to take the Deadpool series but seems like it could keep going for a while and run successfully.For anyone looking for a movie worth going to and seeing in the theaters I think weve finally got a candidate.

1067,1.0,26-Sep-24,"I really don't have much bad to say about this movie. It was everything I hoped for and then some. Without spoiling much I'll just say it is everything fans wanted for the past 25 years in a nutshell down to the last drop. The jokes hit hard, the chemistry between Jackman and Reynolds was stellar and the surprise cameos and action sequences in between and during the plot were highly memorable. I walked out of the theater quoting so many damn lines that were stated and that to me is a staple of a great movie. If I can retain several parts or more of the film well after I watch the credits roll, then you're a true keeper. I guess if I had to dig deep and find anything really lacking in the movie it would be that they really didn't have a big bad villain, albeit traded a big baddy for a more nuanced and vaguely familiar one. Overall, if there was a good, solid theme for this 3rd installment of the Deadpool series I'd say it would be in that it was a nice send off and farewell to the past 25 years of 20th Century Fox Marvel movies and one hell of a Fox homage that I was happy to take part of and show up for with bells on.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1071,1.0,3-Aug-24,"Let me start by saying the previous two Deadpools I thoroughly enjoyed. I even watched them multiple times at home after they were released. Deadpool And Wolverine starts off like the other two Deadpool films. It is funny/over the top and felt like a welcomed return to the character.As soon as the TVA captures Deadpool and Mr. Paradox played by Matthew Macfayden explains how Deadpool's world will be no more, things took a turn for the worst.The only logical reason I can see for Hugh Jackman to return as The Wolverine after dying in Logan is pretty obvious. Money. It truly hurt too see them ressurect his character after the perfect ending he had in Logan (Which is easily the best Marvel film to date).Then there are the endless cameos because nostalgia! It gets old FAST! The fact that Marvel has too rely on cameos to make the film work shows they are desperate and have run out of ideas.From the lackluster script to okay fight scenes nothing really works because the film as a whole is very hollow. I did not care about any of these characters and the whole entire premise of the film (there wasn't one) felt pointless.I will say the cgi was surprisingly well done and all the actors did the best with what they were given. I do understand why a lot of diehard fans love this film but other then nostalgia and Disney/Fox jokes it is just another superhero cash grab.The idea that anybody is rating this over 4 stars is completely insane but I am not a Marvel fan boy. There were multiple moments where I wanted to just get up and leave but it was a family outing.If you are on the fence about seeing this film because of the high rating please don't make the mistake I did. Just wait for it to be on Disney Plus or better yet don't watch it at all.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1072,1.0,23-Aug-24,"One of the most striking aspects of ""Deadpool x Wolverine"" is how it masterfully balances humor and violence, something that has become a signature of both characters. Deadpool, played once again by Ryan Reynolds, brings his usual brand of sarcastic, meta-referential humor, breaking the fourth wall at every opportunity. His jokes are sharper than ever, and the film is filled with moments where the audience can't help but laugh out loud, even in the midst of a serious situation. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman's Wolverine provides the perfect counterbalance. Wolverine is as brooding and intense as ever, bringing a sense of gravitas that grounds the film amidst the chaos. His violent, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving is as brutal as we've come to expect, and the contrast between his character and Deadpool creates a dynamic that is both entertaining and surprisingly heartfelt.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool's peaceful existence comes crashing down when the Time Variance Authority recruits him to help safeguard the multiverse. He soon unites with his would-be pal, Wolverine, to complete the mission and save his world from an existential threat.I laughed, laughed, and then laughed even more. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen lately. The film is packed with jokes; not a minute goes by without a hilarious punchline. The frequent breaking of the fourth wall, with numerous jokes targeting Marvel and the shift from Fox, is absolutely hilarious. The unexpected cameos are a real treat, adding to the excitement and keeping the audience on their toes. The fight scenes are thrilling, filled with intense action and cool moves that keep you on the edge of your seat.Both leads, Ryan Reynolds (as Deadpool) and Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine), delivered great performances. They were born for these roles and shared some great chemistry between them. The movie definitely lacks a strong story but that's not what you would look for in a Deadpool film.Overall, this movie is a perfect blend of comedy and action, making it a must-watch for anyone, especially Marvel fans who would understand all the jokes.

I like the treatment about connection.. deadpool 3 is non serious and it is so much positive note for this movie!

Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds officially gave their best performances in this movie.

I think they needed more substance behind the motivation. This is still a great one! I wish they would have showed the face of the woman Deadpool and not always have her face covered.

I will give it to Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman they literally are saving the Marvel franchise right now as we're watching. This movie hands down was probably the funniest marvel movie and they made at the same time the bloodiest action I've ever seen in any Marvel movie. Some of the dialogue in this movie was intentionally to make this an R-rated movie. Also the trailers to this movie basically tried to give you so much information before you watch the movie there's so many other hidden gems in this movie People are going to be talking about this on all social media platforms for weeks and months to come. I guarantee you if you try to find as many Easter eggs as possible and you're at number 250 give it a week and someone's going to be at 395.

1078,9.0,24-Aug-24,"I went into *Deadpool & Wolverine* hoping for an exciting, action-packed movie, but what I got instead was a confusing, boring mess that I can barely even call a story. The storyline made absolutely no sense from beginning to end. It felt like they were trying to cram in as many characters and scenes as possible without any thought to how they all fit together. Well known characters were thrown in for no apparent reason, and even though they're great characters, their presence did nothing to improve the film. It's like they were just there to say, ""Hey, look! More superheroes!"" But in the end, it added nothing to the experience.There was absolutely no suspense at any point. The plot was so predictable that I found myself completely disengaged. I was there with my two sisters, and they're not as involved in the Marvel universe as I am, so they laughed two or three times, but I've literally watched everything Marvel has put out, and I knew this movie was trash. If I had gone alone, I would've left early on because, honestly, I was BORED, and I'm not easily bored. Deadpool yapped so much throughout the movie that it became unbearable. I get that Deadpool is supposed to be talkative and witty, but in this film, it was overdone to the point of being obnoxious.The fighting scenes were another huge letdown. They were repetitive and lacked any real excitement. Since both Deadpool and Wolverine are practically immortal, the stakes were nonexistent. Watching two characters who can't die just punch each other over and over again is about as thrilling as watching paint dry. There was no tension, no sense of danger, just the same boring, drawn-out fights that didn't even look good.In the end, the movie was a complete waste of time. The storyline was incoherent, the characters were misused, and the action was dull and repetitive. Even with all these popular characters, the movie somehow managed to be one of the most boring superhero films I've ever seen.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The cameos as well was just as shocking and made me fanboy as they made their appearance. The big bads are just as evil as they come but Emma playing as Cassandra was very shivering her performance it was.

The movie is also filled with a bunch of great cameos. 3. The plot is also amazing, and it does make sense in a good way.

It is absolutely a great third movie of the Deadpool franchise and I would also say that it is the best of the three movies.Before watching this movie I told myself that I wouldn't beat the first Deadpool movie. But oh boy I was wrong.The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool) & Hugh Jackman (Wolverine/Logan) is 110% noticeable through the whole movie. It fits perfectly with how the movie wants to tell a story.I was very skeptical on the whole: ""Bringing Wolverine back from the dead"" idea, but I did enjoy the way they brought him back since his death during the ""Logan"" movie.The energy and comedy is still very good just like its two earlier movies.The soundtracks is incredible just like the earlier ones and it just takes the energy of the movie up and gets the crowd going.If you're a person that loves cameos than this movie is 100% for you. There's so many characters and names that will surprise you and make you get excited for the next one. (I recommend watching the credits to see the official names).I'm a huge fan of Deadpool and this movie made the long wait worth it for a sequel. This movie will totally win at the box office (as it already has).But is this movie ""the Marvel comeback"" movie? I will say... Maybe... This movie will do great at the box office, but it isn't a straight up movie I would say directly tells you that the future movies/shows from Marvel will all be great. We've seen the trend of ""one good movie/show and then a bad movie/show"" the last couple of years. But I have hope for the future... Cough cough* RDJ is back!I had a blast while watching this movie. It has one of the best opening sequences I have ever seen, great chemistry between actors and a fine set of comedic lines that are funny... But it is in typical Deadpool fashion.

Teaming Deadpool with Wolverine must be one of the craziest team ups. I think their team was more like a old goofy couple who love each other so much that they don't mind pushing a sword into each other's hearts.This movie was more of a X men typo which is not a bad thing. It really serves a welcome for the mutants in a rather not stunning way but a decent manner. The Cameos makes it up very wicked and interesting. C'mmon you should have got saber tooth to fight wolverine a little more. Meta jokes by Deadpool is truly a delight. "" Disney bought him and they are going to make him do it until he's 90.""

I myself don't have Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X) and all of the rest, and I still got my fair share of information overload. Now the movie was very good in a lot of ways. Introductions and visits from old friends, the action, chemistry between Deadpool and Wolverine, and Channing Tatum finely getting his wish to be Gambit, and a fine Gambit he was. There were a few things I thought could have been played out better, but it wasn't enough to make the movie bad by any means. It was really fun to watch, I just thought there was going to be more of an origin story of how the multi-verse actually worked its magic to bring together how the FF was going to be introduced, and if this is supposed to be Hugh's last round of Wolverine bingo, they probably should have let him sacrifice himself to the timeline.

1094,1.0,30-Jul-24,"The Marvel universe has long been a treasure trove of iconic superheroes and memorable narratives, with Deadpool and Wolverine standing out as two of its most beloved characters. The idea of bringing these two fan-favorites together in a movie has been a tantalizing prospect for fans, one that promises a blend of humor, action, and emotional depth. The announced collaboration in the upcoming Marvel movie ""Deadpool 3"" aims to do just that, merging the irreverent, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, stoic presence of Wolverine.**Deadpool: The Merc with a Mouth**Deadpool, also known as Wade Wilson, is one of Marvel's most unique characters. Created by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld, Deadpool made his first appearance in ""The New Mutants"" #98 in 1991. Known for his sarcastic wit, dark humor, and tendency to break the fourth wall, Deadpool quickly became a fan favorite. Ryan Reynolds' portrayal of the character in the 2016 film ""Deadpool"" and its 2018 sequel cemented Deadpool's status in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). These films were a breath of fresh air, blending hyper-violence with sharp comedy and an irreverent take on superhero tropes.**Wolverine: The Lone Wolf**Wolverine, or Logan, is another cornerstone of the Marvel universe. Created by Roy Thomas, Len Wein, and John Romita Sr., Wolverine first appeared in ""The Incredible Hulk"" #180 in 1974. With his adamantium claws, incredible healing factor, and a troubled past, Wolverine is both a fierce warrior and a deeply complex character. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine in the X-Men film series from 2000 to 2017 became iconic, with his performance in ""Logan"" (2017) being particularly lauded for its emotional depth and raw portrayal of a hero past his prime.**The Anticipation of Deadpool 3**The news that Hugh Jackman would reprise his role as Wolverine alongside Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool in ""Deadpool 3"" has generated considerable excitement. This film marks a significant moment as it brings together two characters who, while existing in the same universe, have had very different cinematic journeys. Jackman's Wolverine, with his intense and often somber demeanor, will provide a fascinating counterbalance to Reynolds' wisecracking Deadpool.The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine promises to be electric. In the comics, the two characters have a complicated relationship, often clashing due to their differing philosophies and methods but ultimately sharing a mutual respect. This film has the potential to explore that dynamic in new and intriguing ways, blending humor, action, and character development. Fans are particularly eager to see how Deadpool's irreverence will play off Wolverine's seriousness, likely leading to a mix of comedic and dramatic moments.**Challenges and Expectations**One of the main challenges facing ""Deadpool 3"" is balancing the tone between the two characters. Deadpool's previous films are known for their R-rated humor and violence, while Wolverine's movies, especially ""Logan,"" have a more serious, even somber tone. Finding the right balance between these two styles will be crucial to the film's success.Moreover, integrating Deadpool and Wolverine into the broader MCU presents another set of challenges. Deadpool's meta-commentary and awareness of the superhero genre could provide a fresh perspective on the MCU, but it needs to be handled carefully to maintain coherence within the established universe. Similarly, Wolverine's character arc and history need to be respected, especially considering the emotional weight of ""Logan,"" which was originally intended to be Jackman's final outing as the character.**Conclusion**""Deadpool 3"" represents a unique opportunity to bring together two of Marvel's most beloved characters in a way that honors their individual legacies while creating something new and exciting. The film has the potential to deliver on the action and humor that fans expect while exploring deeper themes of identity, legacy, and redemption. With Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at the helm, audiences can look forward to a movie that not only entertains but also resonates on a deeper emotional level. The anticipation for this crossover is a testament to the enduring appeal of both Deadpool and Wolverine, and their combined presence is sure to make ""Deadpool 3"" a standout entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1095,1.0,19-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a cinematic thrill ride that perfectly blends irreverent humor, intense action, and the kind of fan service that Marvel lovers crave. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprise their iconic roles with unmatched chemistry, delivering a non-stop barrage of witty banter and spectacular fight scenes that keep the energy high throughout the film. The plot, while simple, is a love letter to fans, packed with fourth-wall breaks, meta-jokes, and unexpected cameos that will leave you grinning from ear to ear. The film doesn't shy away from the chaotic, over-the-top nature that both characters embody, but it balances the madness with moments of genuine emotion, especially in the evolving dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine.Visually, the film is a feast, with slick choreography and special effects that bring their violent escapades to life in vivid detail. The action sequences are as brutal as they are inventive, reflecting the unhinged nature of the duo. Despite a few pacing issues and some gags that push the limits of absurdity, the film manages to stay on track, thanks largely to the charisma of its leads.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a wildly entertaining film that knows exactly what it is and embraces it wholeheartedly. It's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, which is precisely why it works so well. Whether you're in it for the action, the laughs, or the sheer joy of seeing these two characters together, it delivers on all fronts, earning a well-deserved 9/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

From start to finish, it played with real emotions while still delivering laughs and insane action sequences. The chemistry between the leads was undeniable and it flew by, leaving you wanting more.Next film, give us more Blind Al and Vanessa! The only thing that even slightly disappointed was that we didn't get enough of some of the other characters in the Deadpool universe because the story needed to take time away from them. Overall, though, I can't say enough about this absolutely fantastic film. A+++.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I can't explain it, it's beyond amazing. Stop whatever you are doing and watch this and the previous series immediately. And I especially loved the introduction.

The film brilliantly combines a tribute to the 20th Century Fox SuperHeroes films with a New Year's Eve conference, where the MCU is hilariously parodied. While it may not reach the epic heights of Infinity War and EndGame, it undoubtedly stands as the best Deadpool installment to date. The witty humor and dynamic action make for a delightful viewing experience. This film serves as a delightful appetizer, paving the way for the Russo Brothers to bring their expertise to the table.It's not a perfect 10 or even a 9, but a solid 8 for this entertaining popcorn team-up.

No disrespect to Marvel or She-Hulk, but the success of this movie and series like The Boys demonstrates that the audience craves action and comedy combined, without censorship of language or imagery. The film almost gets lost in the plot but manages to end at the right moment to avoid becoming overly long. Maybe a better vilain could help too. But, anyway, we need more films or series like that, with action and comedy and without censorship.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It was legitimately hilarious throughout. I was constantly chuckling at the irreverence, the broken 4th wall, over-the-top action, and what must have been a tonne of raucous improvisation.At the same time, the film managed to be sentimental for fans of the superhero genre over the last 3 decades. That could easily have been sickeningly cloy, but I felt they got the balance just right. It was a pleasure to see the myriad cameos of beloved past characters.If you enjoyed the first two Deadpool movies, then you'll love this offering.

1104,9.0,17-Aug-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a crowd-pleasing superhero movie that is a love letter to fans of Marvel, comedy, and pop culture.The heart of the film is the relationship of the title characters which is perfectly captured by the real-life bromance of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. Their chemistry is amazing no matter what situation they're in.People initially skeptical of Disney watering down the mature rating of Deadpool have nothing to worry about as the humor and violence are arguably at their best here. The constant roasting of the mismanagement of the MCU and X-Men never gets old along with the rest of the Deadpool humor. The absurd amount of cameos and references also rewards longtime fans; More casual moviegoers will feel less of an impact by these moments or even be confused at times.For me, the weakest parts of the movie are the middle-of-the-road villains and the relationship between Wade Wilson and Vanessa. Both were just there and didn't seem fully fleshed out along with the setting of a good portion of the movie that I won't spoil here. As far as the structure of the story goes there wasn't much to it for better or for worse. On one hand, we get a lot of Deadpool and Wolverine hijinx but on the other hand, I was hoping for more hints about the future of the characters and MCU due to the inclusion of the multiverse, TVA, and Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Studios.Deadpool and Wolverine however is an insanely wild ride that's created by filmmakers who are passionate about the characters for fans of the Marvel Universe. Many thought a team-up like this would never happen so seeing everything come to fruition was extremely satisfying.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1106,1.0,17-Aug-24,"This is a great movie, but unlike most great action movies, there are zero slow and boring parts. The plot was quick-paced all along, and every bit of time was filled with some sort of action, plot advancement, or witty banter, or all three of those.The witty dialogues and monologues were packed with more meta-humor on Deadpool's part than a Mel Brooks film, similarly to the first two Deadpool movies only ramped up a notch. Besides merely referencing aspects of the movie production itself or making teasing meta-level observations of transpiring events, some of the meta-humor in the film was meta in the sense of being meta-level teasing of particular characters' actions, words, intentions, choices or character, which satisfyingly serves to provide instant karmic enlightenment by the given character regarding their own follies, rather than their tropes remaining on a comparatively boring, unevaluated level like with most movies. Or at least we can imagine it did that; they didn't outwardly express the emotional or mental impact of the teasings much.The general dialogue of the movie was thick with frequent rapid-fire creative banter, primarily by Deadpool but not exclusively, which made the movie very entertaining. If there was any flaw with the creative banter, it was that it was rather hard to imagine Deadpool likely having the wit to come up with it all so quickly and on such a regular basis, thus making it seem a little unreal and perhaps serving to take one out of the movie.You'd think something like that taking one out of the movie would be the least concern with all the fourth-wall breaking going on, but the fourth-wall breaking really blends in with the movie well. It doesn't seem to detract from the immersion at all.One great thing about this movie is that it borrowed fun elements from various other movies, or at least two: there was a Furiosa: Mad Max Saga-esque world, and a bad lady had stolen Dr. Strange's Sling Ring and made use of it. It also includes the story element of the multiverse with the Time Variance Authority from previous Marvel movies.Some aspects of this movie's plot were satisfyingly and unexpectedly deep, and while Ryan Reynolds' acting could be considered flawless, what really impressed me about this movie was Hugh Jackman's acting ability. I thought while watching the movie that he should get a freakin' Oscar for it. This movie really brings out his acting skills more than any previous Marvel movie.Regarding the quick plot development mentioned above, the one drawback to this was that, while the reason for the resurrection of Wolverine was introduced early on and expeditiously, it seemed to be rather shallow and contrived: it seemed to involve the luck and convenience of a deus ex machina.Overall, this movie was very fun and satisfying. One thing that made it fun was its levity-which, by the way, included playing upbeat songs like Madonna's 'Like a Prayer,' and a particularly rich remix of it, during massive fight scenes. And speaking of the music, its end-credits song 'LFG (Theme from ""Deadpool & Wolverine"") by Rob Simonsen was so good that I fired up Shazam to find out what song it was and saved the name of it in my phone for downloading later, and I'm very picky when it comes to music.I suggest you don't stop watching the credits there, though; sit it out till the end. There's an end-credits scene, and it's actually the funniest part of the movie, at least as far as I and some of the other audience members were concerned.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1108,9.0,19-Aug-24,"As an action enthusiast, I found the film to be quite engaging overall. However, I did have some reservations about the excessive use of flashbacks throughout the movie. These frequent flashbacks disrupted the flow of the narrative, making it feel somewhat disjointed, as if I were watching random clips on YouTube rather than a cohesive film. Despite this, the film managed to recapture some of its initial excitement toward the end. On the positive side, the special effects were finely executed, the humor was well-timed, and the cast delivered exceptional performances, contributing to the film's overall appeal.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It is of course not a movie for the faint of heart, far from it, but the chemistry between Reynold and Jackman, as well as the performances from the entire cast, turned a great picture into a fantastic one.If you have the chance to watch it on the big screen you will be in for a treat.

I get it it's not supposed to be serious but a lot of the story line I found to be pointless.Watch any other Wolverine film and his humour does not reach the levels met in this film, I felt disappointed that he was lowered to this standard to be honest.Not a film that will get a second look from me as I would usually do with any of the other films within the franchise.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1112,8.0,26-Jul-24,"LIKES:Great PaceFunnyStill DeadpoolReferences GaloreActingExcellent SoundtrackSurprising Heart At TimesStory Is Okay At TimesExcellent End CreditsAction Sequences Still Hold That Charm/SkillSummary: If you have seen the Deadpool movies, you know they are about fun, frenzy, and fast-paced antics that the red-clad antihero brings. Teamed up with his X-men ""buddy"". The pace is just as fierce and fun (if not more) as they go about their quest of handling the MCU/Fox merger and more. The whole thing is loaded with comedy, antics, dialogue, slapstick and more all unleashing the full comedic prowess of Deadpool that is still in your face, but curtailed with the rugged bluntness of Wolverine. Reynolds and his team of writers, alongside Levy's direction, read the Internet, the movie problems, and wrapped the tale into nearly 130 minutes of hilarity I've been missing in superhero movies. They poke fun at everything, willing to cross the lines in true Deadpool fashion to leave this love letter to everyone in that charismatic way. It's loaded to the nines with references to so many aspects of Marvel movies and for fans/geeks like me, I enjoyed finding everything I could from the comics, movies, and more (alongside the jabs that were being thrown with it).Yet, the movie is not just about the comedy and stammering lines Reynolds has proven a master at crafting. Deadpool and Wolverine have still more surprises and mastery to give you more to this film for fans to enjoy. The soundtrack is still incredible, surpassing so many of the other movies not just in variety, but the use of these songs in ways that most would shy away from adding that fresh factor people seem to crave. The movie is eighty percent buddy-hero comedy, yet it still holds some of Marvel sentimentality to give our two guys some heart and depth that serves to ground some of the exploits that marrie an okay story without impeding on the Deadpool schtick. And the action proves with the right amount of planning, studying, and potentially removing some of the ""violence"" limits, you can create some of the best fight sequences that somehow stand out in the Marvel Universe. Even the end credits have this iconic balance, not elevating the story, but doing something better that plays right to the strengths of our two leads. And while a lot of this is on the writing, direction, and design team, I have to give it to the two leads for giving it their all to make this movie what it is as well. Corrin's billing deserves a nod, playing her role with the same gravitas as another Marvel counterpart, and injecting other elements that make such a fascinating piece to this complex puzzle. Jackman comes back to Wolverine and seems to have not skipped a beat in the rugged antihero ready to claw his way back to the universe. He's a perfect Yin to Ryan's Yang, crafting this straight-to-the-point, concise, no-nonsense attitude that helps to shut the mercenary up when needed. And Reynolds has pretty much never left the character, only this time bringing even more fire to the role as his character has permission to rebel against the very trends the studios conjure up. Together, the two make this dance of dynamic, dastardly, derogative deeds that remained entertaining the whole way through and was a pair-up that I am very happy to have witnessed.DISLIKES:Plot Is Not The StrongestSuper Violet/Aggressive/CrudeSometimes Too StupidMore Time Needed For Some AspectsVery Reference And Other Series HeavySo many Characters That I Wanted More Time/DevelopmentSUMMARY: The film is incredible on many accounts, but there are going to be some things to mention that might be considered warnings/dislikes depending on your personal feelings. For one, the plot is not the strongest. While certainly not the worst thing to be put together/recrafted, the third installment has a tale that tries to be deep, but comes off as weird, inconsistent, and kind of pointless given everything else happening in the universe. Those hoping it's going to give you full-on glimpses into the direction of the coming Marvel Phases, or looking for that respect towards an arc that will blow your mind need to lower the expectations now. In standing on its own, the self-contained tale is enjoyable, but I can also appreciate the desire to get Marvel back on a fun plot that made Phases 1-3 so enjoyable. My friend and I agreed as well that Deadpool's excessiveness can be hard to swallow, and the third installment doesn't buffer much in the ways of violence and crude displays of debauchery. Those with sensitive ears, sensitivity to very vulgar language, and stomachs not attuned to bloody violence will need to stay away from this movie and the red that essentially floods the screen at all times. In addition, any who don't tolerate ludicrous levels of silliness, ridiculous asides, and banter that could match any monologue fifty times over, should sit this one out. I agree the excess gets a tad much for me at times, but the variety this film brought distracted me from it enough for this to be less of a dislike than it could have been. Where tapering could have been a boon was in curtailing the antics so that we might get more time with characters and stories. Deadpool has a lot of characters who play pieces given everything this film pulls from, and two hours did not give remotely enough time to get the most out of them. Did they serve their purpose and have memorable moments? Sure, but there was so much that could have been done, primarily with Cassio's character. I can't say too much as that would be spoiling. My friend also did not enjoy how reference-heavy the movie was, and I can agree that, unlike other installments, this movie leans very heavily on a lot of cultural knowledge for this very convoluted plot. Again, no spoilers, but fans who know about the politics behind the movies, the pre-MCU days of the franchise, and Deadpool's other films (alongside heavy comic references) will thrive the most, while others may be overwhelmed, confused, and bored by the comedic directions this film takes at some point. Fortunately, Deadpool & Wolverine have enough to mitigate this, but again a limitation for the overall audiences.THE VERDICT: Deadpool & Wolverine had a lot of things to accomplish, and for this reviewer... they certainly achieved much of what I wanted. Overall, the movie is fun and a solid entry into the Merc With a Mouth's installments that excels at so much of what makes Deadpool his signature anti-hero. The comedy alone is enough to lavish over this movie, but the wit, the action, the surprising heart at times, and the acting make this movie fun. It takes the elements of the MCU I enjoyed in the past, but yet puts that modern twist to defend against the trends and Internet to make a movie that isn't hindered by the world's current preferences. And to give me action and comedy, with some drama, looped in, is a success that a reviewer/fan like me can get on board with. However, it is still excessive, and Deadpool's darker plot lines and gimmicks are more NC-17 than R in the ratings department. Those not ready for the gore, cursing, crude dialogue, and darker elements will not enjoy a film of this caliber, nor will those looking for the advancement of the MCU and X-men franchises that we still await in 2025. It also tries to do so much in a little time and relies heavily on one's knowledge of a lot of things to fully appreciate this homage to the Marvel empire. While fans like me will revel in delight, others without the knowledge may find themselves bored or confused to the level of disliking this movie compared to the other Deadpool entries. From all this, my scores are:Buddy Comedy/Superhero/Action/Adventure/Comedy/Sci-Fi: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

From the very start of the movie never dissapoints you and till the end you have that excited feeling, when we all watched MCU back in the days.Props to the people who worked in the project, they have some courage to really go all the way. Sarcastic jokes and breaking the 4th wall are there. Cameos are great, they are really tried to do intro scenes to be specific. The chemistry between these duo are so good, you can feel that both the actors and characters have that connect between them.

The superhero nostalgia fest has a big heart that you've been looking forward to. It's a love letter not just to superhero comics, but also to the Fox era of Marvel movies. It's more gory like ever. It dives more into themes of family, loss, and revenge. There were amazing moments that reminds me of Spider-Man: No Way Home. The comedic screenplay was brilliant. The bloody action packed sequences were TOP NOTCH. The musical score is absolutely worth it. Loved the relentless humor. There are lots of AMAZING cameos and surprises to watch out for.

You must watch the first ten minutes of the fight! But my favorite play was in the MPV, which was a movie about the parallel universe. As the dead waiter said, this idea had been spoiled by Marvel, but it was very funny. It was more funny than most of the comedies I saw this year. The main point of laughter was that the dead waiter roast (X-Men), Disney and 20th Century Fox, and the scale was also very large (after all, R-rated movies). The female dead attendants did not show up (I think the publicity once thought it was unlucky). But the last play about the dead waiter parallel universe was also very wonderful. If the shortcomings were found, the ending was too old-fashioned. Can you guess, it's a big deal A happy ending.

Who knows?We all been waiting for this duo to happen for a long time, even though Wolvie's arc ended with Logan, but I'm afraid he's here to stay possibly until 90 and after 24 years, Hugh wears his iconic outfit from the comics which is arguably better then his leather outfit from the earlier X-men films LOL.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool's sharp and peppery puns work brilliantly from start to finish, and so do the various innuendos. From the beginning, the film is one big parody of Hollywood (meaning in a good way), and Ryan Reynolds & Hugh Jackman take this energetic Road Movie with an overview. Their chemistry is the pillar of the story and works 100%. And now the main thing: Did the return of Wolverine damage his legacy at the end of Logan? I have to say no.......even though Logan is still a total masterpiece. Not to praise, the action (apart from the Deadpool vs Wolverine fight) is rather average and nothing stands out. Ditto directed by Shawn Levy. He is a skilled routiner, but still a routiner. Also, the villain Cassandra Nova is rather one of the weaker ones. However, despite these flaws, I give the film a beautiful 9/10, because there hasn't been a live action Marvel this good since No Way Home.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I see some reviews complaining that this was worse than the other two, I'd argue that they probably simply matured into whatever this humor is no longer as effective as it was when they saw the first two because it is exactly the same in terms of humor, The story is not oscar worthy, none of them are, but that is not why you go watch these films, for me the best thing about it was the huge amount of cameos even if they didn't make much sense, as someone who watches a lot of movies, it was fun. The rest of the humor is mostly references to existing material being other movies or characters or lines, even the will smith oscar slap, and some sex related jokes, exactly what you would expect from a deadpoool movie.I do wish the story was deeper, made more sense, played more with the multiverse, hell maybe even a TV show of 5 great creative episodes would have been nice, just to get more immersed with the characters, and boy there are many in this one! But they barely get any screen time because of that. And I with the humor was juuuuust a little smarter, with hidden jokes within jokes, background details, anything that could make the jokes not feel so flat and predictable. There are some but not enough to make it the masterpiece it could have been, or that most people think it already is, none of the deadpool movies deserve more than an 8, nor more than half a billion in box office, they are good, they are fun, but there are better things out there that deserve more credit comedy wise.But in the end it is a solid movie, worth watching for any deadpoool fan, and those who have seen most of the fox/marvel movies, and do not care about plot depth and logic, just boom boom and fun stuff, best for people that still feel like kids even if they are 50 years old.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Hugh Jackam and Ryan Reynolds in the roles we loved and it suits them better than anything else. The best duo after Captain America and Iron Man.*** Mede me see it twice in theaters. The Thrill i got when i saw the cameos and the laugh i got, was exactly the same when i rewatched it a second time ***We hope that from now on, Marvel will return to its old roots and produce only hits like in the past.PS: Disney watch out, you have one of the most valuable things in your hands.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1123,8.0,5-Aug-24,"I just watched Deadpool & Wolverine, and wow, it was an absolute blast! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have incredible chemistry that makes the whole movie work. Deadpool's irreverent humor and Wolverine's gruff seriousness balance each other perfectly. The film is packed with hilarious jokes, epic action sequences, and so many Easter eggs that comic book fans will be thrilled.The opening sequence had me hooked right away, with a mix of intense fighting and Deadpool's signature humor. The constant fourth-wall breaks were spot-on and kept the laughs coming. It's a fantastic tribute to both characters and their histories, with plenty of nods to past films and comics.If you're a fan of either character, this movie is a must-see. It's not just a fun ride; it's a love letter to the fans. The pacing is perfect, and the two hours flew by. Whether you're a casual viewer or a hardcore fan, Deadpool & Wolverine delivers on all fronts. Don't miss it!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1124,8.0,30-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine: Great fun, terrific dialogue. A multitude of characters from the Multiverse return including Electra, Blade, the Human Torch along with myriad Deadpools. The Multiverse gets more twisted than usual as a rogue employee of the Time Variance Authority wants to delete Deadpool's home timeline and transfer him to the Sacred Timeline where The Avengers hang out (he failed at a previous attempt to join The Avengers) Deadpool is not having this and digs up Wolverine in the hope of reviving him. All he gets though is a pile of dry bones. These come in useful when the TVA Police pursue him as he beats them to death with them. There is a lot of gore in this film, one of the reasons for it;s certificate, the other being the adult jokes and dialogue. Eventually after traversing the Multiverse he finds a living Wolverine to team up with. But will they be able to defeat Cassandra Nova, the twin sister of X-Men leader Charles Xavier? Dafne Keen makes a welcome return as Laura / X-23 from Logan, now grown up and still a headhunter! Plenty of fourth wall disappearing scenes with commentary about Fox and Disney, competing MCUs and bringing things together. All a touch postmodern and meta. Directed by Shawn Levy from a screenplay by Levy, Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells. 8/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The film embraces its R-rated roots, filled with irreverent jokes and meta-commentary on the superhero genre.While the plot is convoluted-centering on Deadpool's quest to resurrect Wolverine from an alternate universe-the relentless humor and fourth-wall-breaking antics keep it entertaining.

1127,8.0,26-Jul-24,"I am not the target demographic for this film. I loved superhero comics when i was a kid. I waited for a good superhero movie or TV show for a long time, There were ebbs and flows with the quality of superhero movies. There were campy TV shows. Then we got the Tim Burton Batman, the Sami Raimi Spiderman, X-Men, and then Marvel. Not all of these films has been good. Some have been dreadful.I really enjoyed the first two Deadpool movies. The snarky fourth-wall breaking character made for two pretty entertaining films. This new movie I loved. It was great. I laughed out loud many times. I was in a theater of people at the first showing on the first day in Imax. I venture to guess that everyone there loved it too.I then heard reviews today. To be fair, I like foreign films and art films too. They're just different categories to me. But i know why critics in general won't like this film. To really appreciate it, you have to have seen the referenced films, TV shows, cartoons, and comics, and be familiar with their characters. For those who have that reference, this is great fun. If you don't have the frame of reference you won't get the joke. This is made for fans of the genre There are characters from TV shows, movies, cartoons, and many comic book references.Another thing that critics won't like is that this movie is very meta on the movie business in general and this genre in specific. Other than that this is a buddy comedy/action film. This is not a new genre and does not have real deeper meaning about life. But it is a fantastic roller coaster ride.This movie is pretty gory at times and very violent. There are lots of sexual innuendos that younger kids will not get and are probably not appropriate for them. But, I saw the original Star Wars movie.more than 40 times that first summer. I fell in love with snarky heroes, action, and great effects. This has all of that, plus offers all of us who love these films a chance to feel like I did when I paid 2$ to get into the first showing of Star Wars and watch the movie 4-5 times in a day. I'll definitely pay to see it again.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1128,8.0,5-Aug-24,"I'm not gonna say this movie has the most interesting or in depth plot. Nor did I expect it to. I (like many others) went into this movie to see these 2 characters interact within the world of comedic gold which is Deadpool. The movie follows the relationship of the characters more than trying to have some deep, muilti-layered plot. Which I was totally ok with and expecting. The movie is so self aware with its storyline and jokes, which was so nice to hear Deadpool saying what every Marvel fan has been thinking for awhile. If Deadpool's style of humor is not your thing, then I don't know why you would be interested in seeing this film. I honestly don't know how people don't find this movie enjoyable. Out of pure entertainment factor it's a 10/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1129,8.0,12-Aug-24,"I've waited for more than 2 years for this cinematic masterpiece to ultimately debut in theaters as the ultimate live-action Deadpool movie outing and it conveniently blew my expectations away by more than a mere potshot.To elucidate this belief in my case, I myself watched this film the first at Reading Cinemas Town Square on Tuesday July 30th, 2024 at 6:15PM, everything about this film was terrific, whether that be, (SPOILER-FREE CRITIQUE), a couple of cameos, comebacks, (the biggest being Wolverine and how well executed and stalwart the cast and crew remained for Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the character, nice). The new characters were pretty phenomenal for everything that had been culminated into a presentation of greatness and cabaret no less. And also sorry for the 20th Century FOX universe about to be altered for eternity, (Diss to the knee, even with Blue Sky Studios), you shall be paid proper homage for your years of nostalgia, (if someone didn't probably do so for you already). The cinematography was well mentally and crucially balanced for the tone of seriousness with gory violence and facetious humor that blew me away even for the 3rd time in a long time, (in forever), stellar portrayals for prom the thespians, (especially for the renowned Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman as the prime eponymous protagonists).As for the prime antagonist, I wasn't too agitated and irritably bothered by one of the antagonists being Cassandra Nova, (but that's less incorrigibly made up for by Paradox, who I thought to be another different variant of Mobius, but I'm more than erroneous up to that particular point). The heavy emotions were carried out nicely as well as the choreography fight scenarios were in the least with a bundle of different ensemble characters from the past, (shan't mention who specifically but good things come to those who wait, even if it isn't everything everywhere all at once, ;) alluding to another 2022 multiverse movie). And did I forget to conscientiously mention about the costume designs for not merely Deadpool but also Wolverine, nice homage to the glorious late 30s comic-book accurate appeal, it's rather satisfying and riveting for how well it was approached in that regard without being to mundane or that overall garnished somewhat. The music homages and the soundtrack was phenomenal as I almost forgot to mention for the prior precursors of Deadpool, (I'll avow to not disclose), and hopefully maybe Deadpool won't merely become Marvel Jesus and alter the course of the status quo of the MCU Phases 4 and beyond, can't wait for much more in store becoming cooking up a concocted pall.Overall, this true pure magnum opus is all the more breathtaking to say for the least that is truly, and might just practically even surpass its precursors by a mere milestone, this for me gets a 9.9/10, no more, no less.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1130,8.0,31-Jul-24,"I watch it in 2D as I just don't like wearing glasses to watch a movie. Definitely a movie you had to go watch before anybody spoiled the important moments for you as there has been a lot of people secretly filming and posting clips ruining the big moments for many who hasn't seen the film yet. As several moments had been spoiled for me and would had gotten bigger reaction seeing certain pre-MCU characters to appear, this movie was a good send off to Fox especially when we get to the end credits, from this point FOX movies are in the past and Deadpool and wolverine are joining MCU from here on out. It also shows how much this movie respected fan castings, but also show different comic version of both Deadpool and wolverine. The story was had to predict and honestly had a wonderful time going down memory lane and this was definitely a movie showing Marvel how to get back on track making movies they want and also showing R-rated Marvel movie can get a lot of audience. Especially the opening scene of this movie is brilliant wat a lot of blood and ""respecting"" the end of Logan. Hope more film to come from Marvel Jesus and friends.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1131,8.0,27-Aug-24,"This movie was so disappointing that I may never watch another Deadpool movie again. Let me explain...this movie was just Ryan Reynolds being completely unhinged with a lot of forced humor, most of which wasn't funny. Wolverine was in it, sure, but it didn't matter. Ryan Reynolds didn't let him shine. He had to steal the scene every single time.Now, I'm not a Deadpool fanatic. I know who he is and I've watched the other two movies (which I did like) so I may be harsher than others on this. There was also a whole lot of fan service which I wasn't interested in because I don't watch all the marvel movies. They also made wayyy too many Fox and Disney jokes. Ryan Reynolds just doesn't know when to stop. We don't need the same joke repeated 5 times.So, I didnt like it, but maybe it's just because I'm not a huge Deadpool or marvel fan. I did like the other two movies, however, but this one was significantly worse, in large part because Reynolds was significantly worse. If you're a huge fan, you might like it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Not something that blew my mind away but good.Some things were not properly explained and may be done in the future. I did find many instances funny but rare ones made me laugh. Not bad there.The action was good. Specially the one shot scenes. Being rated adult I was hoping that it becomes more gore. Would consider 13 + max. Stabbing and blood oozing out is not something I would categorize as adult.One particular scene was really powerful and I think you will get to know which one.All in all a good watch.

1135,9.0,22-Aug-24,"The first two Deadpool films are fun and funny with Ryan Reynolds being great as the character, so having him be introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and having Hugh Jackman return as Wolverine was what got me interested in and excited for this third film, especially since this film will have to try to not mess up what the film Logan (2017) did for the character; after watching the film, I will say that I loved this movie with its great lead stars, great fan service, and fun and funny humor. The third film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) was incredibly fun and funny to watch with excellent performances, fun action sequences, awesome fan service, entertaining cameos, an intimidating villain, great humor involving fourth wall breaks and jokes about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a fantastic opening credit sequence, and a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era of comic book films; while watching the movie you can tell that Ryan Reynolds wanted to make a great film, and the film respects the events that occurred in the film Logan (2017) in its own funny and entertaining way.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are fantastic together as Deadpool/Wade Wilson and Wolverine/Logan, with one being the straight man in a way and the other is known for being loudmouth and annoying, that dynamic between them was great and funny to watch from beginning to end; Deadpool/Wade Wilson was once again hilarious with him doing great fourth wall breaks, but also him being introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe by the TVA and trying to save his world was investing and entertaining to watch. It is awesome seeing Hugh Jackman play Wolverine/Logan again, it was cool knowing he is a variant of Wolverine with him having a tragic backstory and an awesome comic accurate yellow and blue outfit; he was funny in that powerful way with him and Deadpool fighting each other or trying to fix his own world, but also, that there is a whole monologue from him in the film that was very effective. Lastly, other than some little appearances from other characters from the other Deadpool films, I will say that I like how they use the TVA to bring Deadpool into the MCU despite Deadpool doing his own way to save his world and ignore everything the TVA says about these multiple worlds; also, there is a character who was funny but acted like an antagonist in some way.The villain of the film is Charles Xavier's sister Cassandra Nova, played very well by Emma Corrin, who was an intimidating character, but she was also smart while having these powers that at times made her seem overpowered, but it worked with what the film is; she did not have much of an explanation, but what I got was that she wanted to take control of all worlds. The action sequences were amazing and funny to watch, with them all being well shot and the fights between Deadpool and Wolverine were great to watch, it especially worked because of the R rating; there was so much fun action, and the film was beginning to end because of the jokes and fourth wall breaks; this also leads to the film having variants of certain characters, lots of cameos, and an excellent opening credits sequence at the start of the film. Lastly, this film has lots of stuff fans will recognize from the comics, with the multiple cameos, variants, comic exact moments, and comic exact characters that are amazing to see; the film was entertaining, funny, and fun from beginning to end, especially for comic book fans.The third film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) was incredibly fun and funny to watch with excellent performances, fun action sequences, awesome fan service, entertaining cameos, an intimidating villain, great humor involving fourth wall breaks and jokes about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a fantastic opening credit sequence, and a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era of comic book films; you can tell that Ryan Reynolds loved this character and that he wanted to make a great film, and the film respects the events that occurred in the film Logan (2017) in its own funny and entertaining way. This was a satisfying goodbye to the Twentieth Century Fox era for superhero films, with it also being a great introduction to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the Deadpool character, along with it being a great third film in the Deadpool film series; if this is going to be the last appearance for the character of Deadpool, then Ryan Reynolds made an excellent trilogy of films thar are fun, funny, and very entertaining to watch and rewatch.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool & Wolverine delivers exactly what we needed: a summer blockbuster that's pure, unfiltered entertainment for two solid hours.It's got everything you expect and want from a Deadpool movie: fourth-wall breaking, razor-sharp jokes, pop culture references, swearing, and bloody action.But the addition of Wolverine and the shift into the MCU bring fresh energy to the mix, and it's welcome. The Deadpool and Wolverine dynamic is the perfect mix of buddy cop and bromance, each complementing the other well.It also has multiverse elements and lots of cameos like other MCU movies but here it feels perfectly fine and not overused. They serve as great fanservice, giving a lot of nostalgic feelings for the fans of the Marvel/Fox universe.The story is simple, but it doesn't require a complex plot to be great. You also don't need to watch a lot of previous marvel movies to understand the plot but it can help for some references or jokes in the movie.Also the music is a perfect fit and ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Bye Bye Bye"" will be stuck in your head for weeks.Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a wild, fun ride that perfectly blends the best of both characters.

1138,9.0,26-Jul-24,"The sarcasm is over in a way that destroys any normal dialogue.Wolverine is great but despite all his trials to add some drama, he fails because the sarcasm destroys it in the right next moment.Also there is no real villain or evil scenario that justifies why we are teaming up wolverine (the immortal) with deadpool, so it looks like we are in a journey that we know from first moment it is going to be very safe, very light, very disappointing.And since there is no real villain, then also all the bloody good fights are between deadpool and wolverine, in a friendly funny way, so nothing intense here too.To keep it simple, they got Hugh, Ryan, and many many easter eggs, to save Marvel's situation.

My theater was laughing for most of the movie. The introduction of Blade and them bringing back Johnny Storm Electra and Bandit were all really cool to see. And to top off a great film.. they showed unseen behind the scenes footage from the filming of previous X-Men movies during the credits which was quite touching for a fan of all those movies. I gave it an 8/10 which is less than generous. Would give it a 10/10 if I believed there were such thing as a perfect movie. Will be purchasing when released on digital!

1140,2.0,30-Jul-24,"With Marvel Studios trimming back on its film releases in 2024 it made Deadpool & Wolverine the most anticipated film of the year. Today, I managed to watch it and here is my review for Deadpool & Wolverine. After rejecting an offer to join The Marvel Cinematic Universe, Deadpool must find Wolverine in order to save his timeline.Main Character Ryan Reynolds plays Wade Wilson/Deadpool and he is just born to play the role and he does give a great performance in this film. He is just really funny and does manage to deliver on the occasional emotional scenes that are required. Hugh Jackman also makes his return as Logan/Wolverine and he is just fantastic here and I love watching him in this role. The chemistry between Jackman & Reynolds is off the charts and easily carries this film and seeing them together is great.Supporting Characters Emma Corrin plays Cassandra Nova and she is a fun addition to the film. She is clearly revelling in her role and I liked how her powers were shown. I wish she had a little more screen time and her motivations were better but I think she does enough to create a fun villain.Matthew Macfayden plays Paradox who is the TVA Agent in charge of the situation and it is a lot of fun to watch him on screen with these other performers as he is incredibly charming and quick witted with his dialogue.The film has a bunch of decently sized roles from people not announced before the film so I will not mention them here but they are good fun. Though if you are a fan of the supporting cast from the first two films then you will be disappointed because they play minimal roles here.Story The story does a really good job of progressing the characters of both Deadpool & Wolverine and the relationship that they have and I very much felt satisfied by the end of the film. However, this film does really lack plot and interesting motivations for the villain. It does sometimes feel like Deadpool and Wolverine are just meeting people for comedic value and not necessarily for narrative reasons.Script The script is really funny, there is so much material to work with for Deadpool to break the fourth wall and he uses it to the maximum amount and it usually nails it. The drama is also pretty well done and it manages to flesh out the two main protagonists.Style When Deadpool moved to Marvel Studios there was a fear that it would be nurtured a little bit but that is not the case. The violence is huge mixed with the bad language and the action scenes are fantastic with some really creative battles on the screen. But, I actually thought the pacing of the film was a little off, it rams so much into it and the first act is a bit slow that I did find it a bit disjointed at times.Overall Overall, Deadpool & Wolverine is a great film. If you are a Marvel or Deadpool fan then you will enjoy this film and I am glad that the essence of this franchise still exists and that this film does deliver in being a fun summer blockbuster.Rating - 8/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It also followed the path marvel was going for which put together the universe that marvel had created. But overall the movie was very very good. It was hilarious and the quips and cameos just added so much to the movie. I don't want to give too many away but my favorite was when wolverines shirt bursts off. Again just little moments like these make the movie.To add on, this movie really puts together the dead pool character and the universe.The acting was very well done.

I just don't quite understand why would they waste millions doing this type of movie, why not do a decent one?And yeah, of course I know the reason why the new generation is able to enjoy this type of film. The reason why is because this is basically a TikTok movie, a compilation of funny sketches with cool music, some nostalgia bait, a lot of 1min cameos, a lot of Easter eggs and that's it.I even considerate Ryan Reynolds a decent comedian but no one can take 2h of him talking non stop, all the same kind of teenager jokes. Also, the real life jokes in a movie throw me off big time, like ""Blake will be pissed"" , ""Hey Hugh"", ""Disney this, fox that"", etc... it's not even funny. Someone, please, for the love of God, tell Ryan that he's not that funny and that a boomer acting like a 12 year old is sad and quite lame and maybe he should focus on the soccer fraud is pulling instead of this modern MCU cringe fest.So, yeah, it's confirmed, the only good Deadpool movie is the first one.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The special effects and acting were good and the action set to music pieces were superb.

I grew up watching the X-Men cartoon show and I could never forget the yellow and black outfit.Ryan Reynolds as expected, brought the laughter playing Deadpool and you just never get bored of it. This film really is the saving grace of Disney after the recent under par Marvel movies they have brought out the last few years. I am so glad they didn't mess with what makes Deadpool so unique and attractive to the superhero genre. Do I want more Deadpool? Hell yeah!Was it perfect, not quite. But not many films deserve a 10. This film definitely deserves a 9/10 and would highly recommend you go see it before spoilers on social media ruin it for you!

Some reviews will trash the title and put this like ""fan service mess"" or ""I walked out halfway through"". Read my words ""Don't listen to them!""Just see it for yourself and then you make the decision. It has a narrative. It has substance. It has the bloody action and violence and vulgar laughs that we expect for a Deadpool movie to have.Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and Shawn Levy were given a mission and they succeeded.

1150,9.0,27-Aug-24,"The best thing about Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool movies are that it doesn't take itself serious. There's none of the artificial gravitas surrounding the Avengers movies - whose problem is that doing it one too many times, it loses its impact.In Deadpool (except for #2), the threat at hand takes a step back behind characters and works mostly as a vehicle for jokes - often the threat itself is the punchline.It's a fun ride and nothing more, but what a ride it is!The chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds is undeniable.The fan service is outstanding - being served a barrage of blasts from the past (Elektra, Blade, the original Sabretooth, Toad, etc) as well as giving a face to notable names skipped so far (Gambit) not to mention the jokes poked at the former 20th Century Fox Ltd, Marvel itself, Avengers (they discovered shawarma, didn't they?) and so on.It's delightful - though not perfect by far and honestly to truly appreciate all the details you definitely benefit from seeing at least some X-Men, some Avengers and the Loki series, which while to be expected is definitely something that works against the movie standing on its own.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The jokes, cameos, soundtrack, storyline, acting and story were all top-notch.It hits much harder if you're a Marvel fan, and know all the characters and references, especially the cameos, but even if not, I can't see anybody not enjoying this movie if they know what they're in for and that there will be some slapstick jokes and don't take themselves too seriously.I saw one negative review from a couple who apparently walked out after 30 minutes and said it was disgusting. I don't know who in the modern world would willingly go watch a Deadpool movie and not know what to expect. It's carefully crafted and designed for fans of the franchise and character, so come on, really.Ryan and Hugh are the only actors that can portray Deadpool and Wolverine, and they do it perfectly in this.If you're a Marvel fan, run, don't walk to the cinema.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

But a constant stream of breaking the fourth wall, followed by D and W bickering like two old hags, followed by gory over the top battles and dozens of superhero cameos, then lather rinse repeat got old pretty quick. It's a shame too, the first movie was brilliant, and the second one was at least fun and entertaining. This had no real plot, the meager attempts at a story were random and incoherent at best.

The humour was still there but I feel like there were less offensive jokes. Really loved Wolverine as well, all of the film was enticing and it had an easy pace to follow. The only downside to our experience was people seemed to come in, take photos and boast about it on social media and then sit on their phones throughout the entire thing. It was really annoying because when you're a marvel fan or even just because you've paid money for a film that you would like to watch, then it's not on really. Multiple people did it. So as a reminder to anyone out there who does this, stop it and be respectful. Just because you can and want to waste your money doesn't mean other people can. It's very sad to see that people now can't sit through a 2 hour film without having to check their socials or go to a film they don't even want to watch.

Wait a long time to see the Wolverine actor appear in a movie again And now that the name came out I feel very happy Thanks for doing it.I find it quite funny in each scene, but it is not suitable for minors to see it.

Watched it in English (I am German) and therefore probably missed even more jokes.Still, I found it to be very funny and entertaining.

Beneath the humor and mayhem, there's a heartwarming tale of friendship and sacrifice.While the movie isn't perfect, its minor flaws are easily overshadowed by its strengths.

It had everything I was looking for in a Deadpool / Wolverine movie: blood, guts, raunchy humor, and a distinct lack of trying to push a message. All this movie wanted to do was entertain, and that it definitely did. It wasn't completely perfect! Very few films are. The jokes all landed for the most part, and the pacing was fine but it did seem like the plot lost track of where it wanted to go a couple of times. Nothing so much to ruin the experience, but it seemed like maybe they were just trying to pad out the runtime when it wasn't completely necessary. It was miniscule, and the ovie was still great in spite of this. I'd probably give Deadpool & Wolverine something closer to a 9 or a 9.5, I feel it's more deserving of the 8.2 it currently holds.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

So much great humor, exceptional action, amazing story, and exceptional entertainment value. One of my favorite things is how Ryan Reynolds's was in Blade Trinity and there's a great surprise origally that's when Deadpool was talked about I love the connections so much.

He never saw the old movies, the good ones, the bad ones, the cartoons, the comics. Nothing.So, for the newer generations, it is a fun movie.But for the old timer like us who grew with all this stuff, it was all the fan service that we never had and everything we expected from the old movies.

Since I've waited for Disney to show me what I wasn't missing with poor offerings with zero plot and frankly far too much silly ness.Deadpool & Wolverine was worth waiting for.

1179,8.0,24-Aug-24,"In 2016, we were shown a superhero from the Marvel universe like we've never seen before. Ryan Reynolds took on the role of Wade Wilson, who becomes the immortal superhero Deadpool after a terrible accident. But Deadpool is not just a superhero, he is rude and particularly violent. In the distance, the whole thing was a bit reminiscent of Kick-Ass that had a kind of equal concept. The first Deadpool- film was so successful that there was a sequel in 2018. Deadpool 2 built on the same concept and was also a great success. Then came Avengers: End Game in 2019 and actually it went downhill with the Marvel movies. Although Deadpool didn't directly have to do with that part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it did have immediate effect, because although everyone was waiting for a third Deadpool- movie, it took us six years to welcome a sequel. It also meant the return for Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, who already hung his metal claws in the willows in 2017. You will immediately wonder how this will be solved since Wolverine is really dead.Of course, Wolverine returns because Deadpool brings him back from another world of a different timeline. Bad luck for Deadpool that he just brings back the most terrible Wolverine you can think of. Because of this timeline trick, it is a breeze for Marvel to be able to bring every superhero back of course and whether you should really want that remains a bit of the question. The film is entertaining and full of humor, but at the same time we can feel Disney's nasty woke hand. Fortunately, there is still some stab to do, but Disney has proven with The Acolyte, for example, that she is even the largest franchise capable of turning the neck. Fortunately, that doesn't happen in this Deadpool- movie yet, but Deadpool & Wolverine is completely deviated from its predecessors. The return of some almost forgotten superheroes who come to help Deadpool and Wolverine is very nice to see. Deadpool really wants to join the Avengers, but is not assumed there, it will eventually mean that Deadpool will end up in the counterpart of the Avengers and hopefully that will be a greater success than what Marvel has been working on lately.Of course, the film bursts with ridicule, but in a positive way. Especially the scene in which more than a hundred Deadpools from different timelines come together is a highly entertaining, but extremely bloody course. This was also quite clear in the opening of the film and that a film like this grave, necrophily and all that kind of thing does not shy away from it, may be clear. It is advisable for deeply believing people or people with a weak stomach to skip the film, because Deadpool is not for the dear souls. It remains to be seen what a possible next part will bring, because who saw such a crossover film between Deadpool and Wolverine actually coming, at least I didn't. Hopefully Marvel will climb out of the deep valley of some ridiculously bad movies they made, but I also had that hope after the fantastic third part of Guardians of the Galaxy and then we got Madam Web. Anyway we are going to experience it.Deadpool & Wolverine has become a bloody, coarse, humorous roller coaster ride. The opening of the film alone is not for dear souls or heavily believing people. Hopefully this is a turnaround in the Marvel universe that falters on all sides. After Avengers: End Game, with a few exceptions, no decent movie came and Disney also wanted to kill you by adding a lot of series to the MCU. But if Disney is good at one thing, it's killing successful franchises, just look at the Star Wars franchise. Hopefully this doesn't apply to the MCU and it's the anti-hero Deadpool who has to pull things out of the mud again. Either way, this may not be the best Deadpool movie, but it has everything on board that makes it worth a ride to the cinema. So if you haven't seen the movie yet and you feel like an evening of brainless stupid entertainment, Deadpool & Wolverine is the right choice.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This movie doesn't seem to be a celebration of that, its just piggybacking on it's familiarity and Nostalgia factor. Ryan Reynolds has completely seem to ignore what made first two movie a Deadpool movie and not ""Ryan Reynolds"" movie. This movie has completely undone how fun and personal the first two movies felt. Everything is overdone, exaggerated not in a very entertaining way with too many bloated cameos and reference which after first few starts to lose it's Nostalgia factor..After a while this movie became a chore to sit and finish in cinemas as there is too little plot thread to keep the screenplay going and zero character development for you to actually care about any character. Wolverine is my most beloved childhood hero and somehow this film made me dislike him. Only decent scene with wolverine were DP visiting his variants(the irony) to recruit him, as Wolverine is somehow ""anchor being"" or some made up thing which the film spends some time trying to exposition dump. Another problem with movie is it's mindless action followed by exposition dump followed by dumb jokes which gets old pretty quick and when you feel stagnated a not so deserving cameo. I can't believe they brought back wolverine from death for this silly plot and X23 cameo is wasted(she ends up giving lame pep talk to Wolverine who doesn't actually have a daughter or doesn't care, so what was the point?).. Cassandra Nova plot is super contrived and she is added to long list of one dimensional marvel villaim..The irony is ppl cherish Marvel and hate Fox movies/timeline, but Fox did excellent job with all of their latest xmen movies than this bloated cameofest of a mess which is neither true to its source material nor the cinematic universe.

Ultimately when one goes to see this film one knows very well what he is going to face also because it is the third in its saga and brings honor to all the others even if it is the one with the least plot overall.

1183,9.0,1-Aug-24,"Best film in the cinemas in the last years. It was just so great. It had all the things the previous super hero movies lacked: a heart. It had human connection, personal drama, character growth. It was funny, it was interesting and it was very vulgar (not for people who don't like those kind of jokes).I absolutely loved the dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine. Their bro-mance and the many gay jokes.The soundtrack was magnificent. Just the right thing for the action scenes.Although I enjoyed the movie tremendously, in retrospect I could point out a few things I liked less: the whole ""world destruction"" that became such a cliché in the other 1000 superhero movies, the over load of side characters that we knew nothing about, somethings were left unexplained and it felt like they were there just to move the movie forward, the ""bad guy"" was just a bit caricaturistic.If there will be another Deadpool movie I hope they'll get back with the direction of the first two movies which had more of a personal drama rather than ""saving the world"" kind of thing.But never less, as I said - still the best movie in recent years.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1184,8.0,1-Sep-24,"The only movie I've seen four times at the theater, Deadpool and Wolverine is a near perfect film ... and absolutely perfect for the kind of movie it was trying to be. I am being quite serious in this assessment, even giving myself a few weeks after the first time I saw it (during my stay in New York City) before posting this sort of praise publicly about a movie that was just supposed to be silly fun.Why is it so great? I think it just scratches a lot of different itches. The initial viewing had me coming away thinking there was a crap story at the core of the movie but everything else was so good to more than make up for that weakness. From the second time on, though, I caught and appreciated more of the plot, even to the point of getting emotional in the final action sequence (and it wasn't just because Madonna was playing in the background). Love, as is always the case in Deadpool movies, lies at the center of all the adolescent jokes and fourth-wall breaking.Even this latest time at the theater, the folks seated to my right were having a grand ol' time, laughing at all the funny parts and ""oohing"" at all the... ooohy parts, and it's been a couple of months since the movie premiered. I think it's just that Ryan Reynolds goes ""hey wouldn't it be great if we did that"" and Kevin Feige has been ""yes, go for it"" around 95% of the time. Who knew that artists can make great art when permitted, right?Hugh Jackman brings his top-shelf acting game (when does he not?) to the story, making tragedy and redemption a believable part of a very self-aware cinematic experience. It's about as good as I've ever seen at combining winks at the audience with complete emotional investment by them.I really appreciate what Reynolds has been able to do, both in bringing Deadpool into mainstream culture and with almost single-handedly resurrecting the MCU.

1186,8.0,26-Aug-24,"What a crazy experience it was.. the movie was amazing.Beautifully made thank you note for FOX studios for their share of marvel movies. The studio threw everything in this movie from star cast, R-rated gore action, and amazing CAMEOS.If you have seen the comic con footage you already know some of the returning heroes but there is 1 that just blew me away. The cameos were surprisingly well executed. The guys knew what they were doing. I think it serves as a final goodbye for some characters while merging others in MCU.RR is perfect deadpool and HJ is perfect wolverine and their combination in this movie is beyond awesome. The NSYNC intro is very deadpool.I hope we see more of deadpool and wolverine in future installment and CABLE too (he is my fav) !!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1187,8.0,9-Aug-24,"For a start I loved the first two Deadpool movies, the second was even better than the first. But the third? Deadpool vs Wolverine is entertaining, but what it lacks is any depth or useful plot. There is plenty of comedy, and this movie is funny, but therein lies the problem. Instead of effective jokes this movie depends too heavily on over the top gross out violence and over use of Deadpool's breaking of the the 4th wall. Just like the myriad of cameos in this film its fine, but only works once, because it all leaves nothing to go back to.Both previous Deadpool movies had more involving plots, characters and better jokes. This movie has those things, just not done as well, and perhaps being done too often; proving the rule that more does not always mean better.Another area where this movie fails is its secondary characters. In previous movies these have always been played straight, against which Deadpool can be juxtaposed. But the TVA (a time travel police) are faux comedic and fumbling, and along with other characters give the movie the feeling of being an extended farce rather than an good action movie with great comedy. And that is something the first two Deadpool movies got right.If you like Deadpool, go see this movie. You will enjoy it. But you may find afterwards no particular desire for a repeat viewing.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1188,9.0,27-Aug-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine has been long in the making over the years in Hollywood and after six long years of waiting since Deadpool 2, I can proudly say that I absolutely loved this film and what it represents to a lot of people. Especially comic book fans like me. After bringing almost everyone back to life using Cables time traveling device in the credits of Deadpool 2, Wade Wilson has stepped down from his vigilante/superhero alias known as Deadpool and becomes a used car salesman after a nasty breakup with Vanessa. When the TVA from Loki comes knocking on his doorstep one day after finding out about his abuse of time travel, Deadpool is brought to the TVA and offered a chance to finally join the MCU like he's always wanted. When the TVA informs him that his universe is dying due to the death of Logan/Wolverine from Logan (2017) and that a statistic TVA Agent known as Mr. Paradox wants to speed up the process of his dying universe in order to protect the Sacred Timeline, it's up to Deadpool to go on a mission throughout the multiverse to recruit a variant of Wolverine to help him save his universe from extinction. So for starters, Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool has never been better this time around, while still having some of the same charm from the previous films. Hugh Jackman returning as a new variant of Wolverine was the biggest highlight and standout of the entire film and I will always be grateful that he returned at least one more time to do everything that he has ever wanted to accomplish as the character Wolverine. Especially when it came to his comic accurate costumes from the different variants of Wolverine we see throughout the film. Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova I thought personally was one of the best villains we have had in the MCU in a long while, even though we didn't get much of a backstory for her character, she still had a menacing presence and also managed to have some of the funniest lines in the whole film, which is hard most of the time to do as a villain. When it comes to the cameos in this movie, I will say without a doubt, this movie did not disappoint at all and did justice for certain characters that will be remembered for years to come. As far as any cons goes, other than a few shots of CGI that I figured was done on purpose for the sake of the film and a few choices of dialogue, there is not much at all to complain about with this film. Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is the most fan serviced movie I've ever seen in my life, that gave us all everything we could of asked for, while also giving us everything we didn't know we needed as well and will go down as one of the greatest comic book movies of all time. Rating 9/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1190,1.0,30-Jul-24,"I had never seen a Deadpool movie before, and had until recently found Ryan Reynolds to be really annoying. I first started appreciating him with Free Guy, and since then have loved everything I've seen him in (the Hitman movies, even the kid-centric If). I went to this one based on the previews i had seen and the INTENSE marketing that was being done by both Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. My biggest fear was that (as so often happens) the best lines were given away in the previews, and I would suffer in silence through a really terrible movie. Boy, was I wrong. I don't think I've laughed that hard all the way through a movie in years. The fast talking Reynolds is one thing, but his aside are something completely different. He comes up with turns of phrase that catch you by surprise and make you fall out of your seat with laughter despite yourself. He is a provocateur but in the BEST possible way.I won't give ANYTHING away here. You really need to see it for yourself, and I hope you do. It is absurd and silly and filthy and subversive. And it is JUST what I needed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1191,1.0,28-Jul-24,"The last time I was excited to see a Marvel movie was Spider-man: No Way Home. Deadpool & Wolverine definitely brought the MCU back a sense of relevancy and allure to the big Marvel movie considering the state of the MCU the last few years. I'm happy to say, the movie delivered almost everything.A pretty fast paced movie, where the journey, when you think about it, didn't really go too far. Movie starts off with the classic, how did we get to this moment. After some confusing exposition in the beginning trying to tie up everything in time travel, we get to the famous scene in the trailer where Ryan Reynolds tells the audience that pegging isn't new to him, but it is for Disney, and then there we go off to the races.Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds definitely let their bromancy chemistry out on the set, and Jackman delivers another Logan style Wolverine character. The tortured wanderer. It was very fitting for the roll, where the movie acknowledges just how powerful 'Logan' actually was.The humor is back, but there are a lot of spots where Deadpool takes a backseat to the others on screen, where he is more of the setup guy for others to steal the show. Channing Tatum and Wesley Snipes have to be acknowledged for how they delivered on their parts and having Dafne Keen reprise her role definitely bridges the movie extremely well with 'Logan'.Regards to my Title, its not Ryan Reynolds that is Marvel Jesus. He's the catalyst sure. The irreverence and 4th wall breaks definitely brings the fun back to the MCU, but its Hugh Jackman's performance. The movie may revolve around Deadpool's universe, but without the heart, character, and depth of Jackman's Wolverine, there is no movie here. Definitely worth a Theater trip. Hope you enjoy.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Strategically gruesome, nostalgic, encouraging, hilarious, and contrary to the one's that want to get offended for the sake of being offended it's a phenomenal movie.

Well, I'm glad he came back for another stab at the role, because this is the funniest and most frenetic superhero movie I've seen since THE SUICIDE SQUAD. Reynolds is on fine form here and Jackman is even better, stealing all of his scenes as the increasingly weary antihero.

Then the movie starts to play it safe in the sense of forcing the plot as opposed to letting it develop naturally. The pacing is also up and down between great action, shoving in plot, and then starts to fall short a tad when trying to become serious in tone. However, there's lot of surprises and typical Deadpool fun, but sometimes leads to a couple moments that I'm a huge fan of in terms of direction... 8/10. It's one of the best MCU entries since Endgame, but leaves a little more to be desired in terms of the third act in the sense that it feels like the movie was building up to more than what we got.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1199,1.0,27-Jul-24,"Expect the usual mix of 'realism' undercut by copious amounts of breaking the fourth wall which constantly reminds you that you are watching actors act in a film which has a commercial imperative. Suspend disbelief then have have the rope holding you up severed. Rinse and repeat, to good effect. This makes the Marvel universe (MCU) cross-promotion not just palatable but also enjoyable. Any cynicism by the audience is anticipated by Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) and it is he who lands the first blow.Not having watched any trailers for this film beforehand, I went to the cinema without any advanced knowledge of what happens. I'd already forgotten the previous Deadpool films but I've reviewed them both here and liked the first one more than it's sequel. This might be my new favourite in this franchise.I had seen clips or read somewhere how Reynolds was mindful of not tarnishing the memory of Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) as seen in that superhero's last solo outing. I hadn't even remembered that Wolverine had died there but the flashback to this scene in this Deadpool film reminded me that I think I've seen that film...and given it a good review on this site. Fans of Wolverine concerned with this issue have a Pyrrhic victory on that front, in a manner of speaking.It looks like I've missed a few new developments in the MCU, especially with regard to the TVA (Time Variance Authority). They seem to be a temporal equivalent to parking inspectors or ""grey ghosts"", as they are known in Melbourne, Australia. Maybe. I won't give away the plot but it is up to Deadpool to save the universe. Mind, Deadpool will often tell you that he isn't the type of person to the save the world. And the world is a bit smaller than the universe.What's appealing about this sequel is that it seems that Deadpool often appears to address me, personally, a casual fan of some of the MCU. He's like me in that often he doesn't have a clue who some of these other superheroes are. He'll ask them to introduce themselves, which is helpful to both of us.The first big 'reveal' of a potential ally for D & W in The Void drew a blank from me, until he did his superhero thing and I could place him (I could dimly remember that character from a rather uninspired film from prior to the MCU, some many decades ago). In other words, I couldn't put a name to the character but the character rang a bell.Another time I was more on the ball. A black character appears in The Void and I could pick the character, I felt, without the need for an introduction. Reading the actor's name in the end credits was a surprise...it would seem that AI was used to represent him, along the lines of what was done for Harrison Ford in some scenes of the last Indiana Jones film. Basically, the look of this character triggered my recall of him from a film that I don't really remember, having seen it many decades ago.Back to Deadpool being helpful to casual viewers, there's an amusing scene where he pointedly says what I'm thinking when a superhero is speaking English in a thick French accent (""thick"" along the lines of that Spanish character in the sitcom Blackadder).As for Wolverine, well, Jackman has a chest like a barrel in this film, which makes me wonder whether he has kept in shape since his last turn as Wolverine or he got into shape for this film. Not being immersed in all things Marvel, the significance of the pairing of Deadpool and Wolverine was no doubt wasted on me. Personally speaking, a pairing more likely to make me cream in my jeans would be Deadpool and Tom Baker era Doctor Who. Both characters are mouthy, irreverent and go about saving the world. They just do it in vastly different ways. Deadpool can't do it without spilling Olympic-size swimming pool amounts of blood and gore. Lots of people die. However, Doctor Who does have a particular set of skills well adapted to the direction the MCU has gone with this film and elsewhere. Having AI do some of the VFX for the representation of Tom Baker would be ideal too.Other match-ups would no doubt infuriate Marvel nerds due to how anti-climactic they are.This was a fun and enjoyable film. I could probably watch it again for pleasure, not just because I often missed lines of dialogue here, for whatever reason, whilst in the cinema. Blu-ray would be my choice on that front, just so that I could enable subtitles when the dialogue isn't clear.If you like jokey, fourth wall breaking stories with plenty of blood and your favourite superhero frequently French kissing an ugly dog, then this is the film for you. When it was attempting to be serious, it did pull that off with feeling.Notes to self:In the end credits, two people are mentioned...Len Wein as a ""significant contributor"" to the X-Men and Raymond Chan, who is described as ""an anchor"", in the sense intended by its use in the film.Towards the end of the film, I was thinking that it would end with a plot hole but it didn't.That dramatic finale was very nicely done, in how it misdirected our expectations.Mad Max is referenced in the film and some of the scenes made me wonder how it could have so similar transport to the recent Furiosa film, which they presumably would not have had access to when they were making this.The use of snippets of existing songs got ridiculous towards the end. It's as if they realised that they needed to meet a quota for a double album soundtrack for the film and had to get cracking in the last few minutes to do that. .Rated MA15+ in Australia. This is presumably the same film that is rated R in the US.The man on dog tongue action was way too much for me.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The action is probably the best from the series. Each fight is truly a joy to watch. The opening is one of the highlights from the trilogy. The film also manages to bring a great soundtrack. The only bad thing about the film that I can think of off the top of my head is the lack of some of the previous X-force members. Left me kinda dissapointed.

The reliance on over-the-top action sequences, typical of superhero films, overshadowed character development and meaningful plot progression. Additionally, the reliance on gratuitous fan service and self-referential jokes often felt lazy, distracting from deeper storytelling. The chemistry between the leads was overshadowed by a lack of cohesive vision from the direction, rendering what should have been an exciting collaboration into a convoluted, uninspired mess.

Some of the screen where they mix violence and humor like the opening fight sequence was graphically disturbing at points.

My hunch was accurate. It's a 9. If you were to be critical, an 8 is acceptable. But any lower rating is intentionally downvoting.

1213,1.0,28-Jul-24,"Deadpool and Wolverine is pretty much what you expect, with a few clever twists and some let downs. It's a Deadpool movie, so there is a lot of vulgar jokes and one liners asides and inside innuendo about superhero movies, drugs, sex, and violence. It's also a team-up with Wolverine from the Fox Films X-Men film franchise, and so he brings a more nuanced darker subtler tone with dramatic A-list acting. But, it's also a Disney/Marvel film and contains the ever-confusing multiverse.The combination is a strange film that doesn't always work...but so what? It's fun as hell! Deadpool and Wolverine run around the multiverse battling villains and heroes, some new some old, from multiple superhero movies. They also deal with Professor Xavier's evil sister, and a bureaucrat from the multiverse with his own agenda. All to save Deadpool's timeline - which can only happen if a Wolverine who destroyed his timeline can snap out of his depression.While there are probably a few too may corny jokes the middle of this film that get kind of old - near the end the two heroes have to battle an army of Deadpools...which is a flat out a hoot and anyone who says otherwise is crazy. It's really hard not to appreciate how much fan service they do in this film - and how great Hugh Jackman is as Wolverine.When the film is over - you're glad Hugh Jackman has been brought into the Marvel universe and you absolutely want to see more films with him.

1224,5.0,20-Aug-24,"Woe, honestly wow. This movie was phenomenal. It was hyped and hyped for a reason. I have not laughed that long for a movie in ages. The amount of cameos and giving other characters a second chance it was absolutely amazing. I have no words to describe it, I don't know what to say. There were no bad things about this movie only good and watching back on the credits made me realise how much I loved watching the x men movies during covid 19. And it's soo sad that disney has brought fox and it is the end of x men movies unless disney want make some, but it will never be as good as the fox x men movies. Overall best movie I have seen In a while. In fact I will even say best movie this year. And definitely my favourite deadpool movie.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

This movie has some odd couple and I heard it was supposed to be called Deadpool and Friend, which is crazy. This movie was a little sad though. And I feel bad for Deadpool. But sadly I didn't watch the first and second Deadpool but I still got the movie. Who doesn't love the song at the beginning? If you don't you're weird. I can't wait for this to come out on streaming on Apple TV on October 1st. When I mean it is weird that an X-man teams up with a not even Avenger it is weird. In conclusion, this movie is great!I would recommend to a friend!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

In the previous movies I found him a bit too much, too over the top, too crude. What ever it was I always like him, but didn't love him.But he slays it in this one... and Wolverine... WOLVERINE!. Didn't know i missed you so much. Wow Hugh Jackman can act... Amongst all this insane story, action, comedy there is an amazing redemption story.I loved it so much. I found the writing to be so smart. Always calling out when there was too much exposition. Never afraid to talk trash to anybody. The fourth wall breaks were so my favorite. Talking trash on Disney, Fox, calling out Ryan's wife. Man that had me in tears.Go see it!!!!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

A genuine celebration of Marvel's legacy that is sure to tickle you down under, one that reminds us old-school Marvelites of the highest highs and the biggest misfires. With extremely bloody violence, dirty humour, incredible performances, complete savagery and absolute love of the superhero genre, Deadpool & Wolverine functions as a beautiful closing farewell to two of its MVPs yet simultaneously looks towards the future with the highest of hopes.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1229,1.0,15-Aug-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" (2024) is a cinematic mess that epitomizes everything wrong with modern blockbuster filmmaking. The plot is paper-thin, barely holding together the chaotic barrage of characters crammed into every scene. The overuse of humor, which is Deadpool's signature, backfires spectacularly here, rendering once sharp wit into a tiresome, repetitive slog. It's like they threw every joke at the wall, hoping something would stick-spoiler: nothing did.The storyline is predictable, devoid of any tension or genuine surprises. It's almost as if the writers decided to lean on fan service and overwhelming references instead of crafting a compelling narrative. Speaking of which, the constant barrage of references is not clever; it's lazy, and it suffocates any chance of originality.To make matters worse, the film indulges in excessive violence and vulgar language, seemingly to shock, but it ends up feeling gratuitous and hollow. This is not edgy or daring-it's simply overdone. The special effects, while technically impressive, are also overused to the point where they lose their impact, blending into the chaotic noise that is the rest of the film.In short, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is an exhausting, disappointing experience that relies too heavily on cheap thrills and shallow humor, leaving any semblance of substance behind. It's a weak, overstuffed, and ultimately forgettable entry in the superhero genre.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Gen X & Older Millennials will be tickled seeing familiar faces and hearing so many references. The opening credits scene was epic to a level of perfection that can't be described, and you will never listen to that song the same way again.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman exceeded expectations with their acting and chemistry on screen. Casting and acting all around was perfect. I can say without a doubt any other storyline, or a different set of characters, wouldn't have been able pull of this level of perfection.

1233,1.0,6-Aug-24,"I'd say that the saddest part of this film is that it didn't happen 15 years ago, except that it did... And everything between now and then had to happen the way it did to create this gem. I didn't think DP 1 or 2 were particularly great. Reynolds tends to beat stupid jokes to death, and others are just so superficially in the toilet, they're just not funny (I'm thinking especially about shirt cocking it, and Juggernauts electric cheeks). DP 3 has the same humor missteps, but frankly not as many, and there's a lot of very well treated cameos that somehow fit the setting and the story. It's certainly a parody of an MCU that has become a parody of itself, but it was treated smartly, and I think only Reynolds could do it... But it's lightning in a bottle and I doubt they could catch it twice.Jackman and Reynolds truly were born for this movie. Their charisma is enough on their own, but together they're truly on fire. A clear example of how the right actors at the right time, with the right chemistry, and the right cameos can make a movie truly memorable.Will it hold up? To everyone watching it this year, I believe it will. To anyone watching it for the first time in 10 or 15 years? Time will tell but I have my doubts. Hell, I'm not that young, so for me it's a part of my post COVID happy time memories.Now, will it save the MCU? Not a chance. Disney had no part in making this film great, and seeing some of what's on the horizon for their upcoming MCU films gives me serious doubt. This film was all Reynolds and Jackman. Enjoy it for what it is.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1234,1.0,4-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a cinematic masterpiece that captures the essence of Marvel's beloved characters while delivering an exhilarating blend of action, humor, and heartfelt moments. This film is not just a treat for die-hard Marvel fans but also a remarkable standalone experience that will captivate anyone who appreciates top-notch storytelling and character development.One of the standout elements of this movie is the dynamic bond between Deadpool and Wolverine.

This thoughtful inclusion not only pays respect to the rich history of the Marvel universe but also enriches the film's tapestry, making it a true celebration of Marvel's legacy.Perhaps the most striking aspect of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is its energy.

It manages to balance high-stakes action with moments of levity and introspection, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.

1236,8.0,26-Jul-24,"So first of all, don't get me wrong. This movie is a lot of fun with great action sequences from start to finish and even though I hate relying on cameos and references, it's still surprising and nice to see some of those faces in the MCU.But, this movie with 5 writers still can't escape the trap of post-Endgame Marvel scripts. This movie is actually the epitome of what's wrong with the last two phases of the MCU. They messed up with Doctor Strange 2 once by making the movie just 2 hours and not giving ample time to anything, and they somehow did the same thing here.This movie is actually the Multiverse of Madness people were expecting. Fans will rejoice seeing what fanservice they're gonna throw at them in this movie. But all of them are the at cost of the plot.Just like Spider-Man: No Way Home, if you already didn't see the problem with the writing of this movie and think it's great or a masterpiece because they did some cameos, you're definitely gonna see the cracks in the plot with the second viewing when you're not just focused on the eye-candy action scenes and cameos.The biggest problem with this movie is exposition. This movie's dialogues have the subtlety of a hand grenade. It looks like the head writer of this movie is dyslexic and while reading the guide to writing a script, mistakenly read ""Tell, don't show"" instead. Because my God this whole movie is a big giant exposition. And no, being self-aware and meta about it doesn't excuse it when everybody in this movie is just expositing. This movie had a budget of $200 million, but they didn't have the budget to shoot more scenes for at the very least the Wolverine of this movie? Even he exposits his backstory as if his name isn't in the title and isn't one of the main characters. ""I guess just saying some lines is enough for the audience to care about the characters"", the writers thought to themselves. And I guess 70% of the budget went to the cameo actors.At least with the Multiverse of Madness, we had the backstory of Scarlet Witch from WandaVision and it was the same character we've seen since 2014. This Wolverine is a whole new character that I already forgot about what happened in his universe, because guess what, they don't show you anything, just him talking about it. They rely on your beforehand knowledge of his character for you to sympathize with him and care about him. But sorry, it just doesn't cut it for me.Even if we are to compare this movie to Deadpool 2, this movie still pales in comparison, and I didn't even like Deadpool 2 that much either. Now Deadpool 2 seems like a really good movie after watching this. Somehow this is the worst of all three Deadpool films. At the very least I can respect Deadpool 2 for actually having the semblance of a plot with a somewhat well-written villain and new characters like Cable, whom they actually Showed his backstory instead of him only dropping some exposition every 10 minutes! That movie didn't have to rely on 20 years of pop culture to trick the audience into thinking they were watching a competent film. They actually went and wrote a real plot for a movie that actually feels like a movie based on stories and characters from comic books, and gave them decent characterization unlike this movie.But this movie barely has any plot. Just like Multiverse of Madness and No Way Home, this movie finds a lame excuse to throw multiverse into the mix so that we can have cameo galore. And I really really hate the whole world-ending plot every single superhero movie and show has. It was already lame and trite 10 years ago, and it still is. I roll my eyes every time the goal of the villain of these movies and shows is to destroy the fabric of the universe. I bet they're gonna come up with a world-ending plot for the finale of their new Daredevil show too, can't wait to see that masterpiece!It is also funny that this whole movie revolves around the TVA and the Void, and the movie has cameos you wouldn't've even dreamt of, but they somehow don't even mention or involve Loki here. It's weird since with what happens in the finale of Loki, you'd think this would be the perfect movie to actually mention him or something, but nope.Like I said, if this movie was longer and they actually developed Wolverine's character a bit to make us care about him instead of relying on previous movies and distracting us with cameos, and maybe instead of having Wolverine fight Deadpool every 15 minutes (which were really good nonetheless), you actually spent some time with that Wolverine and did more with him, it would've made the movie a lot better and more competent. But unfortunately, nothing's changed and the latest Marvel movie still suffers from barely having a plot and competent script.Overall, while this movie is really fun to watch and has great action scenes and some surprising cameos, the plot is nearly nonexistent, the characters are one-dimensional, and the overall script and the dialogue are awful. You can basically call this film ""Exposition: The Movie"" and you wouldn't be wrong. If you're a hardcore superhero fan and MCU fanboy who still likes the movies after Endgame for some reason and only cares about cameos and pop culture references, you're gonna love this. But if you're tired of the same superhero movie with the same plot and are actually expecting a movie that feels like a movie that has a competent plot and decent dialogue and characterization, you're gonna be sorely disappointed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1240,8.0,4-Aug-24,"The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine is one of the most intriguing and entertaining in the Marvel universe. Their contrasting personalities create a unique blend of humor and intensity that resonates with fans. Wolverine's disciplined and stoic nature often serves as a grounding force against Deadpool's wild and unpredictable antics. This not only leads to comedic situations but also highlights moments of genuine friendship and mutual respect.Their interactions are a testament to Marvel's ability to craft complex character relationships that transcend simple hero-villain dynamics. Whether they're teaming up to face a common enemy or clashing due to their vastly different approaches, Deadpool and Wolverine's relationship adds a rich layer of storytelling that continues to captivate audiences. Moreover, their shared history as products of the Weapon X program adds an extra layer of depth to their relationship. Both characters have endured immense suffering and loss, which occasionally brings out a more vulnerable side in each of them. This shared trauma sometimes creates moments of unexpected solidarity and understanding.The banter between Wolverine and Deadpool often provides comic relief amid the more serious and dark storylines, making their scenes together memorable. Fans appreciate the unpredictability of their interactions, never quite knowing whether they will end in a fight, a begrudging team-up, or a surprisingly heartfelt conversation.

In fact, I think it's probably the best Deadpool movie yet and the most fun I've had with a movie in a long time.If you are not a fan of graphic violence and crude humour, this movie won't be for you.If you like that sort of thing, but haven't seen a lot of superhero movies, this movie might be a 6.5/10. Make that a 7 if you've seen the previous 2 films and enjoyed them.To enjoy it as much as I did, you need to not only love the humour and enjoy the violence, but you also need to at least be familiar with a lot of superhero movies, including those from the pre-Disney era. (Unfortunately, it's hard to recommend what to watch without spoiling things.) The cameos carry this film and, overall, are probably the best I've ever seen in a movie.If you've seen Deadpool 1 and 2, you know what to expect.

Holy cow...for once, they kept the 83 secrets/twists/cameos hidden. THANK YOU, Marketing team. Finally did your job right. (Though, some of the biggest jokes did lose their impact having being ruined from the previews.)I digress. Since Mr. Pool has finally joined the MCU - and in case you didn't know that, they'll repeatedly remind you in this movie (not a complaint - each one-liner was hilarious,) it would be hard to rank this movie amongst the other 30+ films. This was wildly different than any single one of them. That said, I'd probably rank it...8th.Not that it's a perfect movie. It's just that the majority of the MCU was merely good to meh and some terrible entries. This was a VERY entertaining film and deserves a top ten spot.While this was out of this universe, in more ways than several, this VERY much felt like a Deadpool movie. Helps I just revisited 1 & 2 within 24 hours. Six years since the last one and it's as if they just walked off Part 2's sets.As the title indicates, Wolverine (nice to see you back, Hugh!) & Deadpool team up, fight, unite other heroes, fight, make up, fight, swear a lot and kick some A when their worlds/universes are threatened or broken. Will Tilda ""Ancient One"" Swinton's twin (actually she's a twin of...joke, no spoilers here) stop them and destroy everything they love?The jokes were good, fresh and relevant, though I can't see them aging too well for future generations. Can't say this movie was made to stand the test of time, but for now, it was a great addition and conclusion (if this is the last) to the D-P-Three.That said, was I laughing as hard as the first two? Negative. But, I WAS laughing a lot so it definitely did its job. What I actually liked the most, and I can't believe I actually feel this way, were the cameos.Obviously, I ain't spoiling ANY of them for you, and you should unfriend anyone who does. They were all SO good to see again. And speaking of which, definitely stay through the credits. The first clip is really touching and very fun to watch. And the second/final clip post-credits was pretty comical.Definitely a recommend to any Deadpool fan or even of the MCU as this 100% intwined now. I do wish to see it again soon as I bet I missed a ton of the Easter Eggs, references and jokes.***Final Thoughts: Funny. I just rewatched 1996's Twister in anticipation of this year's long-overdue sequel, Twisters and I was thinking: ""I really miss huge Event Movies (like the original Twister.) Doesn't seem like they're really made anymore."" If a movie's gonna make its money, it'll be in the first two weekends and then shipped to streaming a few more weeks later. They're like quick firecrackers these days vs. The old days of Event Movies that last for months, with constant week-after-week box office profits and repeat-viewings.Well, Deadpool & Wolverine feels like an Event Movie and while I know it's gonna make insane money this opening weekend, I hope it has longevity. I know I wanna see this again very soon.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

In the midst of the onslaught of jokes and violence, are well-handled tributes and well-placed Easter eggs and references. It tells its story well enough while making room for lots of fan service. It's indeed a real crowd pleaser, which is what it most wants to be.For those who have issues with multiverse movies, don't worry, Deadpool and Wolverine is a Deadpool movie before it's a multiverse movie. I don't think people go see these movies for their amazing stories. People want to laugh and have fun. So if you liked the first two movies you'll have a blast with this third installment. The action is wild and exciting. I was hanging on every word of dialogue as I didn't want to miss a single joke or reference.The movie is so self-aware and just what Marvel needed at this time. I like how they humorously acknowledge instances where the MCU and the genre as a whole have fallen short. Deadpool speaks for the fans. It shows us that the writers are at least aware of what the people have been saying.Ryan Reynolds and Deadpool know how to create a good time, but I admit I was most excited about Hugh Jackman and Wolverine. It was so good to see him back as the character, but even more comic book accurate than we've seen him before.I loved that they managed to give us humor and heart with this movie. Marvel has given us a few examples of how a movie can be ridiculous and hilarious and yet somehow get serious and sentimental without it feeling jarring or out of place. It makes me think of the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. Both of these trilogies came out strong with a very successful first movie, followed it with a good sequel that was also fun, and then ended with their biggest and best.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

But i was please to see that this movie does not hold back on the meta and jabs against both Fox, Disney and woke stuff in general.Movie is very violent, the curses are there, and altough the story is really secondary to the rest in my opinion, its still such a fun movie to follow and get surprised at the numerous cameos and references.Obviously seeing Hugh Jackman once again in the role of Wolverine was a joy and its in my opinion the best movie where he star as Wolvie.This movie is a must see for any comic book movie fans. After numerous disapointements at Marvel both in movies or mini-series on Disney+, this really feel good.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1254,1.0,28-Jul-24,"Marvel has always been audacious, whether we realize that or not. Even as traditions and cultural mores sometimes cramp and even asphyxiate, even as oligarchs and old unyielding machiavellian monarchs persist to control and extort, even as fear and insecurity and self-doubt paralyze people and sometimes entire societies into inaction and malaise and paranoia, good old-fashioned moxie rooted in the simple elementary desire to breathe free and feel the sun springs eternal. Moxie. Audacity. Marvel moxie. Merc with a mouth kinda moxie can jolt you loose and free you, at least for a little bit, until the human condition and existential constraints reel you back in again. But alas that human condition with all of its misery is just what Deadpool was born for- he comments and commentates to the crowd even as he himself experiences the human condition firsthand. What a trooper. ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is audacious and audaciously funny and it could have even been more so if not for the need to wrap up or tie in so many strands and loose ends, which is a notorious MCU complication. Nevertheless, the movie is a show and the show must go on and the showman and his showmanship needs room, plenty of it, even if he needs to break the 4th wall to get it. ""D&W"" is a doozy, a jaunt, a feast for the senses with its heart in good places- check it out at a theater near you.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1256,1.0,28-Jul-24,"We've waited so long for this moment, and it was beyond fun, wholesome, full of surprises, emotional and epic! Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy pour out their hearts for this movie to be what is it.It's beyond the MCU timeline, it's beyond even FOX's ""X-Men"" movies. It's about all the kids who grew up with these movies and these characters. The kids, who are now adults (like me), but still love every bit of it.You know it's going to be fun with these two, but man... I laughed so hard, even my stomach was feeling it. And the jokes... be sure this is not Deadpool watered down in the MCU, it's Deadpool at its best. The inevitable bromance unveiled before our eyes. The story is fine, nothing special, but you feel it, and knowing the past knowledge about these characters and their respective universes makes everything hit the emotions.What about the cameos, you'd ask, I guess? Well, we already know about a bunch of them, but be sure, there's a bunch more and even the ones we already knew are more than what meets the eye.Emma Corrin as the villain Cassandra Nova is such a good addition to the movie and to the MCU as a whole. She is smart, strong, cold-blooded and also makes fun of our two leads.The action and the visuals are beyond amazing. There are some really, really creative scenes, where adamantium swords and claws create such a mayhem, that makes everything so bloody!The music choice is great and fun, at times could crack you so much. The opening scene is pure gold!Can't praise the movie enough, but ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is definitely in my top 5 cinema experiences, and you can easily guess the other ones. The whole theater was laughing, cheering and sobbing like a one person. What more could you ask for? Also, the movie got such a rewatchability factor, the length is perfect and be sure it will make tons of money! You can't possibly catch all the details in the first viewing for sure, but you will want to, so you'll go again and again... and again.What about the credit scene, you might ask? I kind of don't want to say anything about it because I don't want to spoil even the possible direction your thought is taking. Just stay for it, also during the credits there is something really beautiful. It's nowhere near ""fun filler"", it's not ""Infinity War"" level too, but it's a great movie, and it's one of MCU's finest!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It's very American in it's sense of what entails as a Comedy these days which sucks because there's not a lot in it. I smirked twice no laughs or chuckles. Neither did the theatre.The trick worked in 2016, it sorta worked out in 2018 too but in 2024 it's just an embarrassment.

1261,1.0,29-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine (3) (2024) -As we left the cinema from watching this film the first thing that my 74 year old Mother said was ""I need to watch that again!"" taking the words right out of my mouth and it wasn't even because she's a deaf old cow who probably missed most of the throwaway jokes, but because it was just so damned enjoyable. I really hope that it will be just as good when I do go back to watch it with the foreknowledge of it all.I very nearly didn't watch the Marvel films and TV series that had been released to build up to this one, having last been to the cinema to see 'Dr Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness' (2022) and not bothering to catch up in between, because I'd been so disappointed with that one.But I was glad that I did make the effort to catch up, because I certainly would have been a tiny bit lost without watching 'Loki' season 2 before this one. It wasn't absolutely essential in order to enjoy Mr Pool's adventures, because it just had such great content and so much of it, but a reminder of the work and the environment of the TVA (Time Variance Authority) was definitely a helpful jog of the memory.Because of the Deadpool's (Ryan Reynolds) hilarious fourth wall breaking it was clear that this story was taking the Mick out of the sudden influx of Multiverse storylines, whilst also utilising that same trope and doing it very well. Not only was it just a good story set in multiple universes, but it was also a great way of fixing many of the situations that had arisen as a result of so many Marvel incarnations and ""Variants"" made by different studios.Joined by Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in an attempt to fix his own timeline, Deadpool caused havoc at the TVA and found himself banished to the void. A waste dump filled with cameos from many of my favourite Marvel films and they just kept getting better. There were twists galore as what I thought was going to be one thing turned in to something else entirely and sometimes there were just some really simple ways to save the day, especially when Peter (Rob Delaney) turned up towards the end.There were numerous action sequences, mostly fights, that could potentially have become boring if they hadn't been so darn good and so appropriate. They happened because the two volatile leads would quite clearly fight constantly and not just amongst themselves, so it wasn't just for the sake of creating massive battle scenes although that was certainly the case at some points.It culminated in a superbly epic way that only the goodness of Wolverine combined with Deadpool's nutty ways could pull off. Everything tied up in a neat bow, but still with huge potential to keep the franchise going and maybe in a new direction?As the film credits rolled there was a stream of nostalgia which I could only imagine was a way of saying thanks to what had gone before, but seemed to be clearly saying that those bits were over and new things were coming that would replace them now that Disney has taken over.It was brilliantly clever in the way that it mocked the multiverse idea, but delivered it far better than the others.I certainly haven't laughed like that for a good long while either. It also had a cracking soundtrack as was to be expected from this franchise.There were superb performances from all. I can't really mention outstanding moments without giving away too much about the surprise appearances, but it was great how they came from a more serious timeline and still managed to take the pee out of themselves as Deadpool had always done.And look out for the Easter Eggs dotted throughout. They will surely fill IMDB's trivia section with all of the fun placements and nods to so much more.I deliberately didn't watch any trailers to get the best out of it and I'm so glad I did that, because it was such a joy to behold everything brand new. I think that I would have been devastated if this one had let me down, but I can honestly say that it beat all expectations.The only reason that it didn't score higher was because it wasn't a totally original idea and there had to be other films and things beforehand to make this work as it did.899.69/1000.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I was a fan of the first two Deadpool movies as they had a compelling story line and characters were well flushed out, but that was not the case with the third one here.

Deadpool & Wolverine is the 3rd film in the Deadpool trilogy this time featuring the team up and highly anticipated return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.It's no secret that the MCU has been suffering from fatigue and creativity lately. The hype around this film was that it was going to be the MCU saviour and a step back in the right direction. The film even jokes about this constantly. With expectations at an all time high can Deadpool pull of this endeavour?The short answer is yes...yes it sure can. Deadpool & Wolverine is pure and simply a summer superhero blockbuster. It knows what it is and just thrives on being a fun film. From the opening scene Deadpool sets the tone and lets the audiences know what they are in store for. Deadpool is consistently funny, has some amazingly done action set pieces, and perhaps better yet throws surprise after surprise at the audience. I went into this film blind as I've just kind of been done with the MCU lately...and let me tell you this is the best way to see the film. Avoid spoilers at all cost.Overall this is a true summer film. One that is meant to be enjoyed in theatres. The plot is serviceable although not groundbreaking or setting the path for future Marvel movies. It knows what audiences are looking for and what they have been asking for and it gives it to them...hard. This is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope Disney/Marvel can continue this momentum going forward.Positives: + The chemistry Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have serve this film very well.+ consistently funny+ some very well done action set pieces+ love him or hate him Ryan Reynolds was born to play Deadpool and 3 films in continues to give a top notch performance.+ Tons of surprises throughout the filmNegatives:Rating: 4 out of 5.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I feel like I just experienced the most joyous nerd-fulfilling film in a long time and I don't think anyone else could've made it happen as on point as Ryan did. The cameo of Elektra and Blade also brought so much happiness to me and it was written all over my face as all I did was smile through the entire movie.

1277,8.0,28-Jul-24,"Finally, after many years of waiting and speculating, we have an answer to the big question. How will Deadpool fit into the MCU? I imagine most of the readers already know, a lot has happened between now and the previous films Logan (2017) and Deadpool 2 (released 2018). To sum up: The film Logan ended the Hugh Jackman's Wolverine story, Endgame wrapped up the Infinity Saga, Disney bought out Fox, and the MCU continued into the next Phases (4&5). In middle is Deadpool. What to do, what to do. Well, the wait is over, and we have our answer to the Deadpool question. The answer is spectacular.Deadpool (played by no other than Ryan Reynolds) has retired the ""superhero"" life. While enjoying a birthday party, he is kidnapped by the organization TVA (Time Variance Authority, seen previously on the Loki series). During his escape from the TVA, he gains the help from a most reluctant ally, no other than the Wolverine (played amazingly by Hugh Jackman). Together, they must put a stop to the TVA's plans of destroying Deadpool's current timeline and go head-to-head with another menacing villain known as Cassandra Nova (played by Emma Corrin). They will brutally fight villains, as well as violently fight between themselves.While past Marvel movies, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, are rated PG-13. Make no mistake, this film is a hard rated R film. I can speak on behalf of the fans by saying, thank you for making this film rated R. Between both Deadpool and Wolverine, they will swear constantly, and spill all the blood of their enemies. With a few powerful moments of Hugh Jackman's serious moments are Ryan Reynolds classic nonstop graphic comedy. For a two runtime, the jokes and violence doesn't necessarily get old. Over the top, maybe, but I can tell the audience never got bored with this film. The main villain, Cassandra Nova, might be another forgettable MCU villain; however Emma Corrin performance shines with the rest of the cast. Especially with the inclusion of so many cameos, and each one of them was a welcome surprise. Whether the cameo was a familiar face or even one's the audience has forgotten about.Unlike the previous Deadpool films, the story itself for this movie felt chaotic at times. Understandably, Deadpool was always a chaotic force of nature and thrives in it. However, keeping up with all the humor and characters can feel like the story is taking on too much. In my opinion, dealing with the subject of the multiverse always presents this problem. However, having Ryan and Hugh's character performances anchor the film and helps steer the film in the right and epic conclusion. If any other character in the MCU lead this film, the chaos wouldn't have worked as well. For a Deadpool movie, this works perfectly within the chaos.Overall, fans of the Deadpool and Wolverine franchise will love this film. Anyone looking for a superhero comedy/action adventure will also enjoy this film. As I said before, the two-hour runtime was just right, even with all the constant graphic humor and violence.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I have to admit I was hyped for it, I enjoyed it but I thought it could've been greater...Let me start with what I really enjoyed about the movie, as always it doesn't take itself too serious as it shouldn't, Deadpool was always a comedic approach to the super hero genre filled with meta commentary and jokes targeting real life situations, the peak of 4th wall breaking, I feel this continues to be the strength of the film and they manage to keep the jokes funny and most importantly fresh!The fact that both these actors, Ryan and Hugh, seemingly have been born to play these roles makes it also a really pleasant experience, they do it perfectly and their chemistry, most likely also due to their real life friendship, shines on the big screen.I also really enjoyed the cameos and the references, regardless of some people calling it fan service, I don't see why that's a bad thing, I feel that if you are going to be ridiculous about the Multiverse there's no better movie than a Deadpool movie to do that.It had some really funny scenes, good action sequences and fights and the soundtrack was really something else.And one thing I was surprised was, regardless if you find the plot interesting or not, they actually nailed the way they set the story, how they managed to bring Wolverine back, adding the TVA into the mix to explain some of the plot decisions, I felt that for a movie that doesn't take itself serious it was a really solid explanation of context.With all of this being said, I did have a few issues with it and the reason why I won't rate it higher;All in all it's an entertaining and good movie, its greatness is simply achieved by the two main actors that bring the characters to life.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

They took the mess they were given by the current state of the MCU and made it work in a way that makes sense and is just the right amount of silly. It's genuinely such a breath of fresh air to see this duo sort of unshackled from Disney's (and Fox's) censorship, with the exception of not being able to do cocaine, lmao. Yes, Deadpool has been rated R in the past. Plenty of violence, language, etc. But this felt different. This was them frolicking through a field of rated R goodness, being gratuitous but in the best way. It's honestly pretty great, and it worked perfectly for this film. It stayed true to the core of what Deadpool is, and is a step up from the sequel. Loved the cameos, the writing, the palpable homoerotic tension between the titular pair. You could argue that there was a bit of an overuse of music throughout, but it was mostly done well enough for it to not bother me.

1282,9.0,25-Jul-24,"While this film pokes a lot of fun at the MCU, Fox, and the hero genre in general, it is abundantly clear that the writers (including Ryan) have such a love and respect for this universe of superheroes. There are so many references, easter eggs, nods, and cameos that will surely require multiple viewings. I would be doing a disservice to spoil anything, much of the films enjoyment on first watch will surely be jumping out of your seat at what is arguably the greatest cast of cameo appearances to ever be put on film. The fanfare here is worth the price of admission alone. The humor is spot on and pulls no punches, the action is brutal! This is a Deadpool movie, so seeing characters from PG-13 hero films performing brutal and at times gory action is incredibly satisfying. There is a lot to love here. The film almost never misses, apart from a couple of lines that cater towards gen z lingo that didn't land perfectly. The film also feels a little small at times, not quite as large scale and epic as an Infinity War or Endgame, but is of the same caliber and feels right at home. Ultimately, there is nothing to critique here. The movie doesn't waste your time nor does the pacing feel rushed. This is a must watch for any fan of the genre, and is pure insanity and enjoyment from start to finish. They absolutely stick the landing on this one too, I refuse to let myself cry in a movie theater but I definitely felt myself tearing up at the end.

1283,9.0,8-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a refreshing breath of irreverence and grit in the Marvel universe, a film that might just be one of the best things Disney and Marvel have produced in years. From the get-go, the movie captures the chaotic energy that fans of both characters crave. Deadpool's trademark humor is as sharp as ever, cutting through the action with a relentless barrage of fourth-wall-breaking quips and meta-commentary that feels both fresh and familiar. Meanwhile, Wolverine brings the grizzled intensity that perfectly balances Deadpool's manic antics.The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman is undeniable, driving the movie with a dynamic that feels like a violent buddy comedy-if the buddies had a tendency to eviscerate their enemies in creatively gory ways. The plot, while not groundbreaking, serves as a solid backbone for the characters to do what they do best: unleash carnage, bicker, and begrudgingly save the day.Visually, the film is stunning, with action sequences that are as brutal as they are stylish. The direction embraces the R-rated potential, ensuring that neither character is diluted for a younger audience. This is a film made for fans, and it knows exactly what they want.Where ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" really shines is in its willingness to take risks. It pushes boundaries-not just with its humor and violence, but with its narrative choices that cleverly subvert typical superhero tropes. However, it's not without its flaws. The pacing occasionally stumbles, and a few jokes feel more forced than fluid. But these are minor quibbles in an otherwise exhilarating experience.In the end, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" delivers a bloody, hilarious, and surprisingly heartfelt romp that proves that sometimes, all you need is a foul-mouthed antihero and a cigar-chomping mutant to breathe new life into the superhero genre. It's not perfect, but it's damn close-a triumphant return to form for Marvel's edgier side.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1284,1.0,28-Jul-24,"Wow I haven't felt this way after I left a movie theater in a LONG time . Hours after I watched it I am still talking about it telling everyone to go see it. It was hilarious, new, fun, action packed ,exciting and did I say hilarious? Ryan is at the top of his game with the fast talking foul mouthed wit he brings to the marvel universe. I honestly want to go back again to the theaters to watch it again because I know I missed stuff laughing so hard . The overall plot of the movie was actually mediocre and I didn't love the storyline or the ""void"" that they went into it was kind of over the top and dumb in my opinion but the comedy overpowered it and somehow it all worked . The cameos alone were worth the ticket price . I would go as far to say it's definitely 1 or 2 best marvel movies and probably top 10 comedy movies of all time .

Jokes are not as good as they were before and the story not really making it.One of the most disappointing aspects of ""Deadpool 3"" is its reliance on tired tropes and recycled jokes. The film often feels like it's trying too hard to recapture the magic of the first two installments. While self-referential humor has always been a cornerstone of Deadpool's appeal, here it falls flat, feeling forced and repetitive. The once-refreshing quips feel like they've been run through a blender of clichés, and the novelty of Deadpool breaking the fourth wall has become stale. Instead of clever commentary, we're treated to a barrage of eye-roll-inducing one-liners that seem to be there just for the sake of being there.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1291,9.0,26-Jul-24,"This is Deadpool from the marvel comics.Have you not read them, you probably won't recognize the themes.Deadpool is about the most skilled and miserable, technically immortal mercenary with a mouth, searching for his place in the world of mutants and superheroes.Deadpool is a psychopath and quite unlikeable most of the time, but as Colossus says: ""Four or five moments - that's all it takes to become a hero."" This is the essence of Deadpool in the comics, where 98% of the time he seems to just be fooling around, but in the end his good side shines through and he actually uses his skills for good.This huge contrast between fooling around, owning up to his responsibility and being a hero can create some surprisingly wholesome moments in the comics.Deadpool and Wolverine is the best take on the Deadpool comics and Hugh is playing Wolverine the exact way we see him in the Deadpool comics. He is always the guy to shut down Deadpool's BS with a good load of dismembering.It is possible Ryan have read Deadpool or his vision is just so spot on that because of his likeness to the character.Either way this movie probably isn't for you if you've never read anything similar to Deadpool or if you don't like over the top action movies with spectacle, dirty humor and a lot of gore.If you are looking for a movie with deep intellectual storylines with a lot of emotion, intricate mystery and social commentary, then save your money and time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1292,8.0,30-Jul-24,"This movie was an eagerly anticipated showdown that promised an exhilarating clash between two of Marvel's most beloved anti-heroes. Unfortunately, it fails to live up to the hype, leaving fans with more frustration than satisfaction.First and foremost, the plot is a convoluted mess. Rather than delivering a coherent narrative, the film is a jumble of disconnected scenes and over-the-top antics that lack any real substance. The story feels like an afterthought, merely an excuse to bring these two characters together without any meaningful development or stakes.Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, while charismatic as always, seem to struggle with the material they are given. Their performances come off as forced, as if they themselves are not convinced by the direction of the film. The banter between Deadpool and Wolverine, which should have been a highlight, often falls flat and feels repetitive.The action sequences, typically a saving grace in such films, are surprisingly underwhelming. Despite the potential for epic battles, the choreography is lackluster and the special effects feel subpar compared to other recent Marvel entries. Instead of jaw-dropping fights, we get a series of poorly executed set pieces that fail to impress.Moreover, the film tries too hard to blend Deadpool's irreverent humor with Wolverine's brooding nature, resulting in an awkward tonal imbalance. The humor feels forced and out of place, while the darker, more serious moments lack the emotional depth needed to resonate with the audience.In conclusion, this movie is a missed opportunity. It squanders the potential of its iconic characters with a disjointed plot, mediocre action, and a tone that fails to strike the right balance. Fans of both Deadpool and Wolverine will likely walk away disappointed, wishing for a more worthy confrontation between these two legendary figures.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1293,1.0,31-Jul-24,"The good: This movie has one of the best intro (credit) sequences I have ever seen. It is funny, irreverent, meta, entertaining and subversive all at the same time. It is flawless - sadly the movie never reaches those heights again. But this movie more or less delivers on what you expect - Deadpool + Wolverine + gore + comedy + 4th wall breaking. A bonus, is that somehow, Hugh Jackson has still got it. And he carries most of the emotional weight of the film. The movie is well paced, with action scattered through out. And finally, the cameos - whilst some do miss the mark - most are good, some are brilliant. Subversive, honorary and/or just simple hilarious fan-service. Overall they add to the movie rather than subtract from it.The bad: The big bad is probably the worst part of this movie. She's so infuriatingly 2-dimensional, with a ""destroy world because people mean"" kindergarten drive. There's also too many plot conveniences to get the main characters to their next destination that it's grating. I'm wildly confused as to why the writers couldn't just come up with a logical reason to move characters from scene to scene.Summary: Overall the movie earns it's spot amongst the MCU echelon. Probably coming at a time when marvel needs it most. It's definitely a top 1/3 superhero flick and is worth the watch. The marvel messiah it is not, however.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The movie gave me a lot of good laughs with enough semi dramatic scenes to prevent an overkill of jokes. The type of jokes is what you can expect from Dead Pool, but for the MCU and also Disney it is a novelty. The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman was as expected great. Lot of inside jokes (they prank eachother loads of time in rl), but also lots and lots and lots of franchise jokes. And that is what I think is an reoccuring MCU issue: you are expected to have seen about every previous MCU movie, other Marvel movie and tv show and read all the comic. Sure I exaggerate a bit now, but lot of cameo's date even before MCU, but also were referring to comics. Some of the storyline can be confusing for people who missed the Loki series (like my wife). But ok, it was fun to laugh at some jokes most of the younger people in the audience wouldnt get (I am getting old), and even though my wife hates complicated stuff like multiverses or references to other movies she had a great time (and she hates MCU movies). So dont bother to dive too deep into the storyline, it will spoil all your fun. I have read some more negative reviews and they all took the movie too serious. Dont do that.

1305,8.0,5-Aug-24,"With the third installment of Deadpool, Marvel is back on top again by introducing the X-Men into the MCU as The Marvels had anticipated and has maintained all the mature tone and dark humor of the previous films. Deadpool had already predicted in the PG-13 version of the second film that Disney would buy Fox and that generated certain concerns once it came true. In the end, Disney introduced Deadpool into the MCU in a worthy way adding to the X-Men franchise. With his characteristic humor and charisma, Deadpool keeps the essence of his previous films intact. He continues with his references to popular culture, breaking the fourth wall and also jokes towards gen Z. The film offers its clever gags combined with a good mix of action and comedy. The soundtrack has very good songs, including an epic version of Madonna's Like A Prayer. The X-Men were already being considered for the MCU, and the best way to start it was with Wolverine. To be honest, Wolverine has become almost the face of the X-Men saga since the first film. Hugh Jackman was brought back as an alternate version of the original Wolverine, but he retains his tough personality. The film also brings back some characters that have been seen in the X-Men saga. In addition, not only does the MCU manage to link this saga as part of the multiverse, there is also a possibility that the X-Men animated series from the 90s could also be part of this multiverse. That's because Wolverine wears the classic costume from the animated series and Gambit also appears in the same outfit he had in the series. All of that is just part of the best of this movie because the rest officially confirms what was suspected to happen after the last Spider-Man movies and the Doctor Strange sequel. The movie also features the appearance and mention of some characters from the Marvel movies that were made before the MCU started. This movie officially confirms that all the Marvel movies that were made over time are part of a multiverse. They knew how to take advantage of the theme of alternate realities very well to connect the movies and series as it happened with DC Comics in The Flash movie. That even helped a lot so that some Marvel movies that passed without pain or glory got a second chance. Deadpool & Wolverine is indisputably a great movie that revives the fascination with the multiverse and also the appreciation for Marvel's filmography even if it is out of a feeling of nostalgia. My final rating for this movie is 10/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Their surprising nemesis is not Professor X's sister Cassandra Nova, Emma Corrin (she played Princess Di on Netflix's The Crown), but the unctuous Paradox, Succession's Matthew Macfayden, who hopes our heroes will follow the diseased timeline & go away.

DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE is a movie with SO many surprises and spoilers in it, it would be very tough to go into this blind. Don't worry, I won't spoil a single damn thing for all you fine people reading this. As a die-hard Marvel fan, this review will probably seem biased, but that's just a part of who I am. Even though I haven't read a single Marvel comic book, I have ingested everything they have released since 2008's IRON MAN, even some from before that. This is a buddy movie between two actual buddies, Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Both were born to play these roles. This is Hugh's 10th time as Wolverine, and he hasn't lost a single ab- I mean step. Ryan is literally the ""Merc with the Mouth"", he's just getting paid to be himself at this point. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, other than the fact that it's the weakest link of this movie. Saying that, I loved literally everything else. It has extremely profane language, has extremely satisfying violent action scenes, and is fantastically funny. There are an absolute litany of cameos that I can't even mention here, all so good. Emma Corrin plays a great villain, whose name I can't even say. This is what Marvel fans have been asking for for a very long time now. It's fan-service up the ass, pardon my Deadpool-ness. There are a lot of ""in jokes"" about companies like Disney and Fox, and for comic book nerds. To understand all the jokes, I recommend watching DEADPOOL 2, LOGAN, and season one of LOKI. I gotta stop myself here before Kevin Feige starts hunting me down. Will DEADPOOL & WOLVERINE save the MCU? Only time will tell.

1315,5.0,26-Jul-24,"Action-packed, heartfelt, and a thrill ride all in one movie! Movie starts out in perfect comedic fashion with Deadpool trying to find Wolverine while he smack talks about how he is overrated. This movie even managed to turn me into more of a Deadpool fan. The special effect fighting scenes are the best I've seen in years of movie releases.They managed to include the right amount of gore while keeping the fighting comical but badass. The villain story did not have much unique appeal but the way they retold the backstories of Deadpool and Wolverine to emphasize their past trauma is what brought the two rivaling faction heroes together.The pace of the movie was perfect, no scene felt out of place, and the environment settings were wicked. Some scenes took place in a desert type mad max environment or as relative to the common civilian areas of Deadpool's apartment, city downtown, and traversing through the woods trying to find the enemy base.If you are either a Wolverine fan or Deadpool fan you will enjoy this movie! They captured the personalities of both characters without being too over the top. Deadpool's comical but heartfelt personality is the strongest a Marvel heroes wholesome personality has been since the original Peter Parker Spider-Man in my honest opinion. Marvel even included a scene honoring Iron Man brilliantly showing how Deadpool knows of the Avenger's top tier existence while envying the fact that he isn't included but also while relishing in the moment how Deadpool is not objectively contracted to be told what to do. Saying something along the lines of ""an Avenger or time travel mission boy?""... you can't tell Deadpool what to do! Do you know who I am?! I'm Deadpool baby, I'll break your nose and roundhouse kick you in the nuts before you tell me what to do and handle the mission myself even without the overdosed testosterone furry man behind my ass.The film makes you feel like you are in the movie experience with the unfiltered one liner humor of Deadpool making fun of every possible person he comes into contact with. If you don't laugh more than 3 times during this movie I'm going to boldly say you must not have a great sense of humor because the insults in this film are top notch. Movie music soundtrack also does not disappoint... I'm not going to spoil it but let's just say there is a troll song that Deadpool fights too like something Starlord would put on and a classic rock song in a fight scene that the likes of Ironman would use. Both music fight scenes were relevant music and captured the fighting essence of movies like Avengers, Star Wars, and Transformers special effects. Fighting was not too zoomed in and not too flashy.My only 2 critique's with the movie was number one I was not a big fan of Juggernaut. I think he looked too human like and the fact that once they made it to the villain base there was NOT a lot of story or fighting in the main villain's area.Character role casting and dialogue were outstanding but the villain story interaction was on more of the short lived side to the point where the main corporate anti-time travel crony guy was more story focused. This didn't make a whole lot of sense since the villain was supposed to highlight the aftermath results of Professor X dying. Story spent a little too much time on the inner battles of the multiverse time travel.Movie was excellent overall however, a great film, excellent characters not just including Wolverine & Deadpool, and the best part is the that the fact that it was action badass but totally wholesome all at the same time. I would buy this movie in a heartbeat once it becomes available on dvd or digital store marketplace. I give the film an overall score of 83.5.

1317,1.0,13-Aug-24,"I enjoyed X-Men comics as a child, but let's face it all the hero's were complete dorks...with a slight exception of Wolverine and Gambit. To this day I don't understand why Gambit has never made an appearance, he was by far the coolest X-Men. So, I was excited to see him even though how limited his screen time was.Deadpool franchise really brought the Marvel universe for the adults who enjoyed Christian friendly Marvel comics as children, to the big screen, unlike Spider Man.The third installment to the Deadpool franchise, did not disappoint. It's not my favorite, but the originality of this film really made it a fun to watch without a single dull moment.I think this film is very child friendly despite the over the top comedic violence and vulgar language. This film is a morality play, about forgiveness, dealing with differences, and finding common good among characters who seem irredeemable.Enjoy!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Wesley snipes (blade ) and channing Tatum (gambit ) brilliant .. snipes has hardly aged . Not once did I get bored of any scene. Would highly recommend anyone to go and see it and not enjoy it . Am considering a second visit . Deadpool and wolverine are such fabulous characters and I've loved the older films but together pure genius . The dog is an added bonus .. and some English actors thrown in as well. Go and see .. you won't be disappointed.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1320,1.0,2-Oct-24,"I was so looking forward to watching this. I cant believe how anyone can say it was good! Absolutely no plot. One fight scene after another, so it got extremely boring and beyond silly. Some of the dialogue was hard to follow and rubbish anyway. Hardly any was funny enough to make me giggle never mind laugh like in the first two films. Deadpool always remained likeable even though you knew you shouldn't like him. In this film however, he was too far removed from reality to make you even care a jot about him, never mind like him. Having a toothless, tongue out, mega old chinese crested dog myself i did appreciate the dog. Even the great little dog though wouldn't tempt me to ever watch this film again. What as waste of money. With all this talent it's a shame they didn't get good writers on board too.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1323,1.0,1-Aug-24,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulWade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) has put his alter-ego Deadpool behind him, and has now settled into a quiet life working at a home convenience superstore, along with the rest of his 'X Force' crew. However, one night, at a raucous house party, he finds himself rounded up by soldiers working on behalf of the zany Mr. Paradox (Matthew MacFadyan), who wants to create a time shift that will wipe out Wade's universe. His only hope is to locate his old adversary, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) whose universe suffered the same fate, and form an unstoppable fighting team.In the world of the Marvel Comics Universe, and DC Comics, which have an unstoppable grip on the box office which shows no sign of abatement, it's easy to get burnt out with the lack of distinction between them all, a mass churning out of the same thing, as long as it all pleases the fanboys. And so, Deadpool is an all the more refreshing character, an anti-hero who doesn't play by the rules, and with all the character flaws not present in traditional action heroes. And Wolverine, of the X-Men, serves as a perfect foil, and they now have a long awaited collaboration that should please those who've been waiting for it.What could have been a self indulgent, self congratulating borefest is instead quite evenly balanced, and successfully pulls off what it wants to do very well. Reynolds occupies the first half, with Deadpool's story told in reverse, and delivers the goods, with Deadpool as his wise-cracking, pop culture referencing best. Wolverine doesn't enter the proceedings until about two thirds of the way in, but when he does, they form a snappy dynamic, with Jackman injecting his grunting, volatile take on Wolverine. Support wise, MacFadyan hams it up as the mysterious villain, while there are surprise cameos from Jennifer Garner (Elektra), Wesley Snipes (Blade) and Chris Evans (Captain America), in their respective superhero roles, as well as appearances from Channing Tatum, Henry Cavill and Wunmi Mosaku.In what appears to be a farewell to the characters, director Shawn Levy has crafted a loud, fun, riotous romp that pays a more than respectful homage to its two central characters, and leaves fans, either casual or obsessive. ****","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1324,1.0,28-Jul-24,I think this is a great marvel movie and the best movie of the year..this movie should get 10/10 rating. The power character is so smooth. The quality is very cool. The cameos is not expected and is very exciting things. Deadpool humour is same and its very hilarious. My favourite character and actors which is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is so cool and I'm glad he's coming back to the movie. It's not recommended for kids under 18 years old .The characters makes me feel nostalgia and I'm very happy for the coming back characters. The ending was perfect and I hope Deadpool and Wolverine will comeback again in Avangers secret war or another movie..Thanks for the great experience. Sorry for the bad grammar. <3 Wolverine.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1325,1.0,5-Aug-24,"I 100% agree with Hugh Jackman when he said he never quite got to scratch the depths of Wolverine in his previous movies. Deadpool & Wolverine ticks off every missed opportunity in terms of storylines, quips, costumes and things fans from the comics always hoped they'd get to see. They packed in everything and more into a film that, by modern superhero film standards, wasn't excessively long either. I'll forever be grateful for these three men (& Feige) for finally delivering a well-rounded Wolverine to the audience. D&W is a film where, the more knowledge a viewer has about the actors, studios, characters and comics involved, the more they'll enjoy it. Deadpool & Wolverine's jokes and references operate on so many levels, it's a film viewers can appreciate more with every viewing. People who say this film wasn't as funny as they'd hoped it would be, or question why Channing Tatum was cast as Gambit, have completely let the last 20 years of superhero movies and general pop culture news whiz by them. Savvy nerds and geeks will feast upon these easter eggs. That's not say D&W can't be throughly enjoyed without knowing all the meta jokes. It's similar to how adults appreciated jokes in Shrek that the younger audience didn't get. On a personal note, it was thrilling to see Jackman back as my favourite character from the Marvel comics and movies. He and Reynolds are a magic combination and each gives something extra to their performance when onscreen together. You can replace Bond, Superman, Spiderman and Batman, but for me, there can be only one Wolverine. Let's hope Disney really do make him do this til he's 90!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Despite the strong performances by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the overall story did not resonate with me as much as other films like Logan and DP2.The inclusion of Laura x23 felt rushed and lacked depth, while Channing Tatum's cameo seemed out of place and unconvincing. It's clear that this movie was made for fans, but the lack of development in both the story and characters left me feeling underwhelmed. I don't mean to be overly critical, but this film just didn't meet my expectations.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Reynolds and Jackman understand their characters well, and the back and forth banter, the push and pull of their yin and yang personas, make them the perfect ""odd couple"" duo. They're both dealing with similar loses (won't go into details because that would be a spoiler) but the circumstances allow them to understand that they're both trying to rewrite history. The aspect of the TVA is quite literally how they plan to do that, with Logan more-or-less agreeing because of a half truth. The fight sequences, the cameos, the locations, the dialogue, literally everything was perfect. And my favorite quality, the sarcastic, inappropriate wit of Deadpool complimented Logan's dry, mature perspective, making their quest epic.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The fight choreography was sick also.The comedy within the movie was the perfect amount of humor with jokes that actually landed. The action and fight choreography was very fun to watch.

There was a lot of 4th wall breaking which I loved, and there were many amazing cameos. The plot was not the greatest I've ever seen, but it was more than enough to move the movie forward and explain the multi-verse changes and leaving the plot of Logan alone and bringing back Hugh Jackman as the one, only Wolverine.

I personally am a hardcore DC fan (despite their disappointing movies) and I still found myself eagerly awaiting ""Deadpool and Wolverine"". I followed the development of this film thoroughly and paid close attention to cast & crew credits with interest. I grew up liking Marvel before it was cool so I had high hopes for this film.As for this film, you certainly get the best of both worlds with both old and new Marvel. You'll certainly laugh until you cry if you get the references, but the little details are what truly bring this movie up to an 8 for me. The story itself is kind of boring and poorly written. But the acting and dialogue are so good that you don't really care.I would put it in my top 5 MCU films for sure but I still felt that they left something to be desired.

Let me tell you why you need to do yourself a favor and see this masterpiece. 1- The multiverse centered plot was executed perfectly, which most other Marvel movies have failed to do. Many other films butcher this redundant dramatic story of a character needing to save a timeline, but Deadpool 3 transforms it into a hilarious, meaningful character arc for both Wade and Logan. Instead of taking themselves seriously, the writers embrace the ridiculousness of Marvel, creating a perfect self deprecating comedy. 2 - The jokes and cameos had the entire audience laughing without one, cheap corny quip that Marvel is famous for. Obviously this is Deadpool, so the dialogue wasn't child or their overprotective mother friendly, but this raunchy comedy is just what this cinematic universe needed to kick the restraints Disney put on their shoulders. 3 - The performances of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman really complete the 10/10 rating. Both actors convey the complex moral conflicts that make these characters unique so well, you can't imagine anyone ever usurping these roles. I don't think I could run out of compliments for Deadpool and Wolverine and this movie secures the title of best trilogy that the Marvel universe has.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1360,1.0,25-Jul-24,"I had pretty much given up on the MCU since Endgame but being a fan of Hugh Jackman and his past cinematic runs as Wolverine I decided to give this one a shot. The violence, profanity and scatological humor is as you'd expect, off the scale, and there is something of a convoluted plot going on, but really the main drive of the film felt like two characters who hate one another and spend a good portion of the film trying to kill one another. But the problem is, knowing that both protagonists are essentially immortal (one with endless regenerative abilities, the other with an unbreakable adamantium skeleton and a fast-healing factor) then their fights become essentially meaningless. They can't kill one another, so it's just basically watching two guys fight with one another and waiting for it to resolve so we can get on with the story. Maybe it was a little interesting with the initial fight but after awhile, it gets old. Likewise the many numerous cameos that I won't spoil here were amusing at first, but you can only do so many ""oh it's him"" or ""oh its her"" reactions and then it gets tedious, especially when you're teased with a cameo and then the character either dies shortly after or just isn't seen again. It's nostalgia key-dangling at it's worst. As mentioned, I am a fan of Hugh Jackman and his return to the Wolverine was fantastic, like he stepped right back into the same role he was so legendary at before, but unfortunately there's just not enough of him and, to be completely honest, I would have preferred to see him in his own film instead of in a tiresome, gory buddy comedy.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1362,3.0,8-Aug-24,"Yep, this will save Marvel enough. I can't imagine the amount of effort to put together a coherent script that contains a hot stew of satirical comedy, The-Boys-level violence, fourth-wall superimposing, and out-of-everywhere cameos and to convince Disney to fund it. Despite playing under Marvel's worldview of TVA and multiverse, Deadpool & Wolverine actually tells a simple story of two losers saving the world and redeeming one another --- a could-not-get-any-simpler formula but made with such respect and compassion of the lore which we have not seen from Marvel productions in a long time. It is a rewarding experience to all the fans who accompanied the cinematic superhero history thus far, whether the universe under Fox, Marvel, or more. However, this movie is extremely fan-based, as well as many other superhero films that are successful in part because they allude to prior works, which is concerning because the story itself is often placed secondary. Anyhow, this film deserves to be enjoyed in a crowded theater or with a bunch of friends --- just like the old Marvel.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Sore. You can experience the lost time in a movie, through our favorite characters, even those inconspicuous villains. They used to live in front of us, and then in our memory. Now they appear in front of us again. This is the surprise and touch brought by various guest appearances.

I've flown around the world to watch stand ups! This was just brilliant! I'm sure their will be the fair share of wannabe ""edgy"" critics who will always try put themselves on a pedestal by going against the crowd but I'm sorry if you didn't laugh out loud during this movie then this type of action comedy just isn't for you! Don't watch it and certainly don't tell people it wasn't good! I don't watch or review romantic period dramas because I don't like them! However DP&W I loved!! There's really not much more I can say! I just loved it! The fight scenes were choreographed spectacularly, the off the cuff 4th wall break comments you could easily miss were so funny, Ryan and Hugh were always going to be a great pairing and yes they really did deliver! I won't put any spoilers in here other than to say do yourselves a favour....

1365,9.0,27-Jul-24,"(MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD) I was very hyped for this movie. I was very excited to see the chemistry between a collaboration expected for years, I was excited to see the cult-funny action moments and the humor all the Deadpool movies, I was excited to see the Villain of the movie (Kassandra Nova) who looked quite interesting, in general everything about this movie looked promising to me at least. And I am happy to say that I was not let down or disappointed one bit at any part of the movie. Don't get me wrong now the movie is not flawless. It's 2 problems for me are the minor plot holes and kind of the way they managed the movie's time. These would be big problems if the movie was taking itself too seriously. DeadPool 3 is a cult superhero movie full of action that aims to only be fun and enjoyable and it isn't afraid to show it. However it still is an objectively quite good movie. I liked the cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting...Everything in this movie just amazing. Is this the so called ''Marvel's savior'' movie that will make us forget 85% of what happened after phase 3? I don't really know. Maybe. What I liked is that I sat down enjoyed 2 hours of MARVEL/DEADPOOL action, didn't get bored ONCE watched a very good movie and in general had a spectacular experience. That is something both MARVEL and DC aren't so generous nowadays so...have fun and enjoy 2 hours and 7 minutes of pure cult, funny, R rated action.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The fight scenes were fantastic, and the comedic storyline had me laughing throughout. The film was packed with Easter eggs and cameos. It had two villains: Cassandra Nova and Paradox from the TVA. Cassandra's powers were intimidating and she had a truly scary presence, although I wish the MCU would do more with her character rather than potentially letting us down. Some scenes felt dragged out, and the pacing was occasionally slow and awkward. Despite this, the movie was overall fun and exciting. It was the great summer blockbuster we had all been waiting for.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It can't even save neither the ""Deadpool"" series, whose first sequel was the only one at all fresh and interesting, nor the ""X-Men"" series, whose ""Logan"" from 2017 could have been a decent ending. The way it is, the movie wouldn't even deserve any comment, but it's good to draw a line once again and state how far this franchise has come. As far as I'm concerned, any interest faded long ago with the disappointing ""Endgame"" back in 2019.What can I say, except that you can like the movie only if you really liked the TV series ""Loki"" (unfortunately, I don't know such viewers), and if your humor remained at the level of preschool age, but far from the fact that the film is recommended for the mentioned age. I'm not even sure who this production is actually intended for, because with this amount of gratuitous violence, severed heads, hectoliters of spilled blood, constant swearing, profanity and cheap lines, it's hard to determine the target group that this wish-wash should like.All that aside, the biggest problem is the lack of any meaningful story, even reasonable motivation and characterization of actors, and that the reminders of some other heroes from Marvel history are reduced to literally appearing and disappearing in the next frame, wouldn't it cause a little nostalgia for long ago past better times, which represents, if not an insult to ours specific once-favorite characters, then certainly an insult to the good taste of the aggrieved audience. Also, there is an obvious intention to plan the future of the Marvel franchise by recycling the same characters from parallel universes, of which this film is just an announcement.I will add at the very end, the only two bright little spots are the main protagonists Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who despite everything showed that they can somehow act in this kind of movie without any inspiration, script and real dialogues. Judge for yourself if you think that's enough to watch it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1369,5.0,3-Sep-24,"We all knew that Marvel had a lot at stake with this premiere to get the MCU and its stumbles back on track, but there was a trio that had an ace up their sleeve to make our hearts beat again.Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman and Shawn Levy give us a really fun, adult movie, designed to satisfy all the needs of fans. Beyond the fact that one can talk about fandom, the interesting thing that Marvel's new project proposes is to honor its past and look together to the future with a duo that breaks it on screen with charisma, blood and emotions.No one can argue with Reynolds' charisma, but it's good to know that Jackman is joining us to give us the tone necessary for an on-screen adventure full of gags, incredible sequences and the adult quality that we all wanted and that we now also know we needed.This is where the intelligence of a director like Levy comes in, who knows how to handle humor, action and blood and sets out to give us all those Marvel-style madness in a correct, precise and fearless way. So much politically incorrect humor, references, jokes and transgressive moments that are squared even over its two predecessors. Decisions that serve to make a correct mix between laughing at the entire world of superheroes, but also giving it the moment to vindicate its own story.So we can ask ourselves, was it worth the risk? Of course, it was worth the risk. It's pure entertainment that leaves no one out of the party, it's a gigantic event that Marvel wins with, not by providing the best MCU movie, but by giving us the movie that we all needed right now, which is to believe again that everything can be possible at Marvel.To think that this is a movie that only uses fandom resources to sustain itself is really wrong. It is a well-made movie that has absolute intelligence embedded in knowing how to handle emotions in equal parts and in respecting itself as a movie that has people behind it who know about cinema and entertainment.It is a well-directed, well-acted film, with a brutal soundtrack, with well-executed sequences and with a villain who is very well occupied, it is not a simple event film to satisfy needs, it is a film that fulfills its role as being in good hands that make it noticeable and without reproaches.For me, it is a result that does not disappoint, it remains firm with the initial proposal of the saga, and knows how to take advantage of certain decisions that Marvel planned lately and that end up being the perfect addition to become one of the most fun and functional crossovers of superhero franchises.A film to watch and enjoy and leave the theater satisfied, simply because Marvel was what it needed to give us, and we were totally grateful to receive it.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

The humor isn't just surface-level; it's clever and self-aware, creating an experience that makes you laugh, think, and appreciate the nuances of satire. It's the kind of comedy that we've been sorely missing, and it's been far too long since we've had a movie that pulls it off this well.In a world where comedy often feels watered down, this film dares to push the boundaries, delivering an experience that's refreshing and undeniably entertaining. We need more movies like this-bold, unapologetically funny, and capable of transporting you to a time when comedies knew how to make a real impact.

1373,1.0,31-Jul-24,"I've head many different takes on the third 'Deadpool' entry - some enjoyed it, others didn't. A few thought it was merely okay. I guess what you're going to get out of this film is dependent on what you stand on the franchise and superhero films in general.If you're utterly tired of superhero films then this one doesn't offer much that's different - a supervillain wants to destroy the world and our antihero, Deadpool, must (finally!) team up with Wolverine (complete with yellow comic book costume) and save the day.And that's it. There's absolutely nothing majorly new about this film, so you could say it's merely average, unless - like me - it ticks all the boxes you're looking for in a film. Ryan Reyolds and Hugh Jackman are great actors who are perfectly cast for their retrospective roles and they play off each other perfectly. I've always wanted to see Hugh Jackman's Wolverine get the 'proper' outfit on screen and go crazy. I get that here. Personally, I loved the Marvel Cinematic Universe up until 'Phase 4' started, so a film like 'Deadpool & Wolverine' which openly mocks how the franchise has fallen is also very welcome. Finally, the cameos. I'm old enough to recall the superheroes films of the late 90s and early 2000s, so let's just say it was great to see a few 'old friends' on screen again.So I enjoyed it. If I had to offer any criticism, I'd say the opening twenty minutes did feel a little slow compared to the 'main meat' of the film. Plus a few scenes later on could probably have been trimmed. Overall, I'd take out between 10-15 minutes of the runtime to tighten it up. The main gripes I've seen online are that it's not very focused and if you dwell too much on the plot then it all falls apart. Okay, this may be true. So, in order for that not to be a problem - just don't think too much about the story and enjoy the excellent chemistry between the two leads and laugh at all the in-jokes based around the genre.I did.

It's not the sex jokes or the one liners or the slapstick humor in particular, but it's deadpool says something that only certain people will get depending on how much they know. This is what creates the disonance between a fictional movie that only refers to things that happen in the movies world and a fictional movie that acknowledges real world things. Deadpool takes both as well as references from other completely unrelated fictional movies to frame his jokes. That's why these movies work so well.Deadpools character is molded through Ryan Reynolds. Hes learned over the years what to do and what NOT to do with deadpool through trial and error. He knows what the fans wanna see and this movie spoon fed it to us.Pulling in wolverine was a necessity to this films success. Hugh Jackman...the man you are. The fanservice we were given was through the roof for simps, geeks, and every type of fan in between. The two of them together was what i needed.Other films needa take notes, this is how you make an audience happy.

This film exceeded my expectations, delivering an electrifying blend of humor, action, and emotional depth that left me utterly enthralled. As a fan of both characters, I can confidently say that this movie is a triumphant success, deserving of a perfect 10/10.The film brilliantly captures the essence of Deadpool and Wolverine, staying true to their distinct personalities while weaving a compelling narrative that brings them together in a way that feels organic and thrilling. Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Deadpool with the same irreverent charm and wit that has endeared him to audiences worldwide. His quick one-liners, fourth-wall-breaking antics, and unapologetically outrageous behavior are all on full display, providing a steady stream of laughs throughout the film.Hugh Jackman, returning as Wolverine, brings his trademark intensity and rugged charisma to the role, reminding us why he has been the definitive Logan for nearly two decades. The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine is electric, with their contrasting personalities creating a delightful and often hilarious juxtaposition. Their interactions are some of the film's highlights, ranging from comical banter to heartfelt moments that showcase the depth of their characters.One of the standout aspects of the movie is its action sequences. The choreography is top-notch, delivering visceral and thrilling combat scenes that highlight both Deadpool's acrobatic agility and Wolverine's brutal strength. The film does not shy away from the graphic violence that fans of the comic books have come to expect, but it balances this with a sense of fun and exhilaration that keeps the tone from becoming too dark. Each fight scene is meticulously crafted, ensuring that every punch, kick, and slash feels impactful and satisfying.The storyline is engaging and well-paced, skillfully blending elements of both characters' lore into a cohesive plot that keeps the audience invested from start to finish. The film explores themes of redemption, friendship, and the struggle to define oneself in a world that constantly tries to box you in. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, adding emotional weight to the film without detracting from its primary focus on entertainment.Supporting characters also shine in their roles, adding depth and richness to the story. The inclusion of familiar faces from the X-Men universe is a treat for longtime fans, and the new characters introduced are compelling and well-developed. The film's villain is particularly noteworthy, presenting a formidable challenge to our heroes and driving the plot forward with a palpable sense of menace.The visual effects are spectacular, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a visually stunning experience. Whether it's Deadpool's rapid healing factor in action or Wolverine's claws in combat, the effects are convincing and enhance the overall immersion of the film. The cinematography and direction are equally impressive, with dynamic camera work and creative shot compositions that keep the audience engaged and invested in the action.The soundtrack deserves special mention as well, perfectly complementing the film's tone and enhancing the emotional impact of key scenes. From high-energy tracks during action sequences to more somber pieces during reflective moments, the music is expertly curated to match the film's shifting moods.In conclusion, the Deadpool and Wolverine movie is an absolute triumph, a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart that pays homage to its source material while offering something fresh and exciting. As a fan, I couldn't have asked for a better portrayal of these beloved characters. The film's flawless execution and captivating storytelling make it a must-watch, and I wholeheartedly give it a well-deserved 10/10. This movie is a celebration of what makes Deadpool and Wolverine iconic, and it will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the best superhero films of all time.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1391,8.0,28-Jul-24,"I must admit I was a bit nervous going to see this one at the cinema without watching a trusted review first. Yes; that's the current reality of modern Hollywood movies. After many a bait-and-switch and betrayal, I've almost given up and resorted to re-watching old movies.This scepticism worked to my advantage this time. The sensation of utter relief and excitement during the opening scene was incredible. And the movie kept delivering with great pacing, contrasting between deliciously manic highs and and a few necessary breathers in between. I still expected the obligatory scene of misplaced, heavy handed morality concerning whatever this years hottest cultural potato might be, and I might even have been fine with it due to the quality of the rest of the movie. But it never came! A delight from beginning to end. Perfectly balanced, as all things must be, but never has been since End Game.Good job, everyone!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1392,1.0,28-Jul-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a masterclass in blending action, humor, and emotion.

A totally nonsense script with no depth, no purpose and to make matters worse it looks like a typical Marvel movie released in the last few years. The R rating of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is the most ""PG-13"" I've ever seen, the violence is made to shock 3-year-olds and the obscenity and swearing make the movie look like a Seth Rogen comedy, but the worst and most unfunny one he's ever made. The direction is actually interesting and the framing even offers beauty (sometimes), but these are perhaps the only really positive points of this movie. In the final balance, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" represents the decadence of the superhero movie era and especially the decadence of Marvel Studios, it's a shame, I could write a very long text about how bad ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is, but to save words, I prefer to end this review here.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

If you're a comic book/ movies nerd then you're in for a treat, because there's thousands of easter eggs and cameos that really stick the landing on account of the meta approach the film takes. I'm not giving away any spoilers but to me it all worked really well. Problems with the movie? The story isn't great, but honestly who cares, it does the job and it's tightly written, the cgi in the third act was not great and took me away for a bit, especially regarding the mask of a certain character.

After violently rejecting their proposal and being banished to a void-like dimension where forgotten cinematic Marvel heroes go to die, he has to rally together some classic heroes to break free and save his friends from extinction.Before going into these films, you need to understand they they are not going to take themselves seriously whatsoever, be full of lewd jokes, break the fourth wall and be utterly rammed with references to not only Marvel, but real life situations. Oscar bait, this is most definitely not. But what this is, it funny, charming, heartwarming and full of awesome action scenes and some amazing cameos. Despite a somewhat underwhelming and annoying antagonist, everything else is on point. I have said it before, but Deadpool is the character Ryan Reynolds was born to play, and Hugh Jackman's gruff and grumpy Wolverine is the perfect juxtopostion to Reynold's cheery and smart mouthed merc.

Here's my take on this rollercoaster of a movie:This film is a glorious, action-packed riot that embraces its absurdity with open arms. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine proves yet again that he's the best at what he does, even if what he does isn't very nice. The banter between Jackman and Ryan Reynolds is nothing short of comedic gold, with Reynolds' Deadpool delivering quips faster than Wolverine can pop his claws. The chemistry between these two is electric, and their dynamic is the heartbeat of the film.The plot? Well, it's as chaotic as you'd expect from a Deadpool movie, but that's part of the charm. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. It's a blend of action, humor, and heart that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The dialogue is peppered with enough f-bombs to make a sailor blush, but it's all in good fun. The cameos are plentiful and surprising, making every scene a potential ""oh snap"" moment.Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova is a standout villain, bringing a cold-blooded yet sardonic edge to the film. She's a perfect foil for our two heroes, and her presence elevates the stakes. The action sequences are a banquet of madness, especially the ""corridor"" fight scene (which is actually in a street) - it's a visual and visceral treat.The soundtrack is another highlight, perfectly complementing the film's frenetic energy. The opening scene alone is pure gold, setting the tone for the chaos that follows. And let's not forget the post-credits scene - it's a must-see, packed with hints for future adventures.In summary, *Deadpool & Wolverine* is a bloody, hilarious romp that's sure to please fans of both characters. It's not Shakespeare, but it's a damn good time. So grab your popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride. And remember, if Wolverine can keep going until he's 90, then there's plenty more fun to be had with these two.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1435,1.0,25-Jul-24,"I am a huge Fan of Avengers, X-Men and Deadpool.*Not Marvel's Biggest Triumph UNSATISFIED: I was eagerly anticipating this movie, but it failed to meet my expectations. Instead of a thrilling action film, it turned out to be just another mediocre entry in the genre.FIGHT SCENES were sparse, brief, and uninteresting, relying heavily on gore and violence rather than action. Forced car fight scene between D&W.The excessive use of VULGAR LANGUAGE felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall experience. Forced use of F-Word in every third sentence.PLOT was average at best. Ryan Reynolds' signature fourth-wall breaks, which were a highlight in the prequels, fell flat this time. The comedy, which I hoped would redeem the film, was a dismal 3/10. A staggering 80% of the movie was CGI.LAME VILLAINs: Paradox and Cassandra, were lame and had illogical motive.Additionally, Deadpool's character disappointed me. His SELFISHNESS, using Logan merely to save his friends while disregarding others, and using Nicepool as a shield, was disheartening. He didn't become any Marvel Jesus or Messiah.OVERALL, this film was a major letdown and did not live up to the hype.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

It felt like it was much more diverse and ""blacker"" in the first parts.

Instead, it adds to the film's gritty realism, reminding viewers that these characters exist in a world where the stakes are high, and the consequences are real.While the film is undeniably entertaining, it also takes time to explore deeper themes. Both Deadpool and Wolverine are characters defined by pain and loss, and the film doesn't shy away from these aspects. There are moments of introspection and vulnerability that add layers to their personalities, making them more relatable and compelling.However, the film isn't without its flaws. The pacing occasionally falters, with some scenes feeling slightly drawn out. Additionally, while the villain is menacing, they lack the complexity that would have made them truly memorable.

Together, with the help of both new and familiar faces, they must defeat a dangerous new foe and save his world before it's torn apart. Overall, due to the fall-out-of-your-chair laughs, Reynold's and Jackman's electric chemistry, badass action, and brilliant meta commentary, I loved this feature, and even though I had a few gripes with it and it's lack of connection to the MCU, this movie was nearly perfect and some of the most fun I've had in the theater, and a great final send off for the Fox universe while also being a highlight for Marvel in its darkest hour.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1474,4.0,3-Aug-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine is a fun and spectacular addition to cap the trilogy. I have a high-level of appreciation for the well-crafted action scenes, quality acting, side-splitting comedy, compelling heroism, sensational soundtrack, appealing costume design, attention demanding pace, triumphant tribute to history, applause earning cameos and heart warming display of human connections. Furthermore, this is a no filter, no holds barred, Rated R, movie that treats the audience like adults. As long as you can handle multiverse concepts, paradoxes, and going Meta beyond breaking the fourth wall, then I highly recommend going on this very mature roller coaster ride!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1475,4.0,1-Aug-24,"She is hands down the best part about this movie. It's the main reason why I'm giving it 9 stars. Emma Corrin did such a fantastic job playing Cassandra, I immediately fell in love with her character. She'sextremely powerful; sexy, cruel, smart and vicious. All the qualities that make for an excellent female bad villain. I hope they bring her back. The MCU needs more female characters like her. Rated R MCU moviesare definitely far better than any PG-13 Superhero movie. It allows for them to depict more realistic scenarios, as well as character development.

Spoiler: it didn't.A nonsensical, disconnected, and utterly humorless story. This movie should have been called ""Cassandra Nova""; she truly deserved this film all to herself. She was the only character that was genuinely good enough, putting the main characters to shame on so many levels.An anonymous alcoholic Wolverine, totally forced. Who thought this was a good idea? Perhaps he needed a psychologist and an A. A. meeting instead of a movie. Seriously, this portrayal is an insult to the character's legacy.An unbearable Deadpool, why wouldn't he shut up? I couldn't stand hearing his voice anymore. It's like they were trying to make him as obnoxious as possible. Besides, he was completely selfish, and it was disgusting to watch. Was the intention to make us feel repulsed by this character? If so, mission accomplished.Unnecessary sexual jokes, unnecessary swearing, unnecessary characters. Few scenes were good. The dialogue was cringeworthy, and the humor fell flat every single time. And what the hell was that ridiculous dog? Extremely forced scenes, it was hard to watch.To be sincere, I was hoping Cassandra did accomplish what she wanted, she was the only character worth watching.

I'm sure hundreds of details flew right past me. But that's okay, because this is that rare superhero movie where you can have little to no knowledge of the Marvel universe and still laugh your ass off.

It's like the movie constantly stutters. It hurts the storytelling very much.And then the jokes, one of the main selling points of Deadpool, in this movie they are forced: look at me telling a joke! Yeah, but it wasn't that good, so please stop bragging. And also don't talk to the audience all the time. I find it highly annoying. A couple of times is OK. This is too much.I can't even go deep into the story, because it was all over the place. The basic storyline is very simple, too simple, but as a whole it is a complete chaos. When things happen, why they happen, how they happen, it seems that little thought was put into it. So on top of the bad flow from one scene to the next it's also a lack of logic in and between scenes. This is reinforced by a lot of unnecessary/useless dialogue, which sometimes made the movie drag. Just tedious. The fighting scenes felt gratuitous.I don't understand the high rating this movie has received. Is it my personal taste? I struggled to finish the movie and had a sigh of relief at the end, even though I loved the first two Deadpool movies. This one's an absolute miss in my book.

The second one was decent but not good as the first! I know the personality of Deadpool is comedic and big mouth and all, but in this one, all.. literally ALL the characters making jokes, some are good, the majority are cringe, corny and cheesy! It's like a bad stand up comedy with all the people joking. The whole movie is a cringe comedy. Even the moments when the movie want to be or seems serious or dramatic, it feels cringe because the next second, a cringe cheesy joke lands!The action scenes are haotic with enough brutality and gore/blood but not enough to save the movie from being a corny comedy! There's a lots of cameos unnecessary. It's some kind of Multiverse of Madness.This is the worst Deadpool movie! I repeat: i liked the first, the second was decent, but this one is just...for the masses who want to laugh maniacally at cringe cheesy jokes every 2 minutes! And again, i understand the comedic thing on Deadpool movies, but this one has too much comedy/corny/cringe jokes! It's a bad bloody comedy and lots of you will enjoy it!

1487,1.0,26-Jul-24,"My experience while watching D&W was seeing a packed audience become restless during any scene that tries to contain story. They continued to be bored at a lot of ""jokes"" that never landed. It's like everyone waited for the next cameo and a handful of funny parts to show any sort of excitement. Half of the laughing always came from the same five percent of the audience, whereas everyone agreed that seeing the cameos was the bright spots of the mess of a storyline.I didn't hate the movie because, thankfully, there were some fun moments, but they serve to only satisfy you in the moment. Even good parts were underscored with stupidity. Usually this was the case where a funny line or visual gag would happen, but there would be a dumb setup or poor reveal. The Paul Rudd joke was funny, because the line of dialogue, but not the setup. This halfway attempt at comedy permeated all 2 hours. The song selection is all over the place and, even though I personally didn't like many of the songs, they didn't fit with the tone of the movie. Why did they have to ruin good action scenes with terrible songs! At least most everything with Wolverine was entertaining and a few fantastic moments with Hugh Jackman.With villains that are confusingly good, an over complicated yet simple story, scenes that drag on, multiple instances of things not making sense, or characters that aren't needed, and a multitude of other things that I would list as choices I would be ashamed to have written, at the very least we get a better Mad Max movie than Furiosa. The more budget a movie has, the more hype it has, the multitude of writers; you would think it produce something that people would be proud of. I would feel embarrassed to be a part of this movie.

Wonder if that was intentional. If it were, there is actually something very brilliant about that. But a part of me suspects that it was totally unintentional, which had the (unwitting, im guessing) effect of making the the whole film feel trivial. However, the cinematography was first rate, the costumes amazing, and every aspect of the production are what you would expect from a first rate Hollywood summer blockbuster.

1492,5.0,25-Jul-24,"Marvel's highly anticipated ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is finally here, and as we all know, it comes at a bit of a crossroads for the MCU (and the genre as a whole.) While I've never loved the superhero genre overall, there's plenty of films in the genre that I've been entertained by, and certainly some good characters that make up at least some of the comic-book blockbusters that audiences love. That said, I will admit that I have been largely disillusioned by the genre as a whole after ""Endgame"" and when things started to progress towards focusing solely on multiverse and cameo-related stuff rather than trying to tell any semblance of a compelling or character-driven story. I enjoyed the first two Deadpool films (and saw them both in theaters when they came out) for the most part, and thought their irreverent, fourth-wall-breaking humor felt relatively fresh at the time by poking fun at superhero movie tropes in fresh ways--so, rest assured, I went in hoping to like this. While there are still some funny moments, the film overall feels very tedious and has everything that I don't really like about this genre and franchise in its current state (as in, focusing on multiverse and cameo-related hijinks with no real stakes/consequential plot/character development.) So for me, this was regrettably a big downgrade from the first two Deadpool films, both of which I would rate a 7 or 7.5/10.The film mostly takes place after ""Deadpool 2,"" and the basic underpinnings of the (very thin) plot is that Deadpool is captured by the Time Variance Authority, and has to save his own ""timeline"" from deteriorating, which, of course, necessitates working with Wolverine. Even though I wasn't a huge fan of the film, I will most certainly admit that chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman can be quite fun--charming even too--in certain scenes. While many of the jokes don't work, there are at least a few that do. But unfortunately, the film falls victim to the same flaws of many of these other recent Marvel films in that there is not much of a plot, or anything remotely resembling compelling dramatic stakes. Given the ""multiverse"" nature of the story (and the fact that both of its main characters have regenerative healing powers,) nothing seems at risk or able to effectively generate dramatic tension. Instead, the film revels in fan-service, which of course is not expected. Some people will very much enjoy that, but for those of us who don't have everything memorized about the 2000s X-Men movies, your mileage may vary. The film's action is for the most part bland and forgettable in terms of how it's shot (and often repetitive in terms of how it's depicted and executed,) which may partially be because its director, Shawn Levy, doesn't have much of a track record directing action films.While I didn't like this film as much as the previous two Deadpool movies, I recognize that many viewers will enjoy this film for the exact same reasons (over-reliance on cameos, fan service, multiverse stuff) that I wasn't as keen on it. And guess what: that's completely fine. Film is subjective. I realize that legions of comic book fans will love their experience seeing this film in theaters, and it's good that they will enjoy it. I also realize that Marvel--and possibly much of the entire superhero genre as a whole--is increasingly not to my taste, or at least much less so than many of these films were 5 or 10 years ago. That's okay too. My score, in objective terms, is only a 5/10, and I wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't big Marvel fans, but I think anyone reading this review can determine whether they would want to see this film or not--if they haven't made that decision already.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1506,1.0,31-Jul-24,"By Ian Chandler - July 31, 2024Deadpool & Wolverine is the MCU's first R-rated film, as it stars Ryan Reynolds as the iconic loudmouth, Deadpool. Joining him is none other than Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman once again. Though this team-up feels somewhat forced, it should have provided a fun duo bumbling around in a chaotic, extravaganza superhero movie. Unfortunately, the film wastes the opportunities Marvel desperately wanted for several years. The pacing is breezy, the action is frequent, but it is depleted on genuinely funny jokes.To start positive, the editing is snappy and appropriate for the zany titular character. It is quick, occasionally stylish, and compliments the film's goofy vibe. It is easily the film's best attribute, as everything else is surprisingly dull in a franchise typically insistent on creativity. Whereas Deadpool 2's X-Force sequences were the film's hilarious highlight, Deadpool & Wolverine struggles to have a defining moment, let alone one that causes one to even chuckle. It favors repetitive jokes such as nicknaming Deadpool ""Marvel Jesus."" If this quip wasn't funny the first time, then it will remain unamusing the next twelve times it is said. All but one of the fourth-wall jokes are not fresh or creative enough to make the audience laugh. Even worse are the movie's weak sexual quips. Vulgar jokes aren't for everyone, yes; but that should not be an excuse for the incredibly lazy, unfunny lines from the characters. They are as creative as naughty jokes from an edgy 14-year-old kid. As a result, much of the humor will only get a laugh from middle-schoolers, a demographic too young for Deadpool & Wolverine.Even though the dialogue could have benefited from a rewrite, perhaps the action will help this threequel shine. There are two sequences that are bursting with morbid inventiveness, those being the opening and the one with a Honda Odyssey. The problem is, there are far more than two total action scenes. The majority of these are a repetition of shootings and stabbings with blood spilling everywhere. These uninteresting events go for far too long and lack the imagination needed in a Deadpool movie. The choreography is hard to compliment or criticize, as the otherwise good editing fails to showcase it. There are frequent cuts and motions that make it occasionally difficult to follow the bombastic conflicts on screen. If one is looking for a fun, R-rated action movie, pick any of the four John Wick films.The plot, unsurprisingly, is another tasteless ingredient in Deadpool & Wolverine. Of course, if one went to see this movie for an engaging narrative, that's on them; Deadpool is iconic for many things, the story is not one of them. It wouldn't be hard to argue that the tale was written in a week; but it is hard to focus on the flawed story because the more important errors found in the latest MCU offering. If the charismatic stars and zany editing were removed, there would be close to nothing able to redeem this frustrating miss of a huge opportunity. The studio did this crossover dirty.Deadpool & Wolverine - 53/100Deadpool & Wolverine has a neat production and mostly appropriate editing, but it fails at humor, ambition, its plot, and a sufficient supply of creativity.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1507,4.0,30-Jul-24,"First of all, it was great seeing Hugh and Ryan back on screen as Wolverine and Deadpool. And it was even more awesome to have Wolverine finally in his iconic suit (as shown in the poster and trailer). They really know how to bring the characters to life. But that's about it. Without spoiling the movie, even though it's only a little over 2 hours, it was long and drawn out, and suffered the same problems that most of the recent MCU movies had (using the multiverse storyline for lazy writing, random fan service, and low quality rushed production). Even the Logan director said the same thing. The pointless intro itself unnecessarily took a lot of time. Again without spoiling, as expected there are a number of familiar faces, and it was actually very exciting to see those familiar faces, but it's really disappointing what they did with them. They could have done so much more with them, and they could have used a lot of the random/drawn-out time to do that. I'm not sure why there are so many raving reviews here to be honest? I was actually shocked the theatre was basically half empty right after release. Normally Marvel movies are packed and difficult to get a seat for a while. It also seemed most of the audience didn't enjoy it either except for maybe 2 or 3 people who giggled at everything. I do really hope they eventually end this multiverse storyline, especially now that they have Deadpool and X-Men under the Disney-Marvel umbrella, and start focusing on the core story with the dedicated cast.

It was not, mainly because it lacked a story.The main problem with the movie, Deadpool and Wolverine is that the story does not start until near the end of the movie. In between are these long overdone action sequences with slow moving camera shots that then switch to real time with bodies flying everywhere. It goes on and on until the next joke from Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool. Then another joke about sexuality. Then another joke before another slow-moving long action scene. Then another long action sequence of slow motion camera filming. Then more jokes from Deadpool in another long dialogue sequence. Not only did the action become tired to watch on screen, but the jokes seemed to be forced dialogue trying to keep viewer interest with humor because there was no story to be found.The movie did not keep me interested. There were some jokes which is why I was able to stay awake, but that was it. It was one long movie of action sequences and comedy joke dialogues from Deadpool. I was able to stay awake long enough to get to the end.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Cameos are great but the surprise and shock value obviously gets diminished after first time watching. Same goes for most of the jokes, specially those 4th wall breaking that can also be considered lame and annoying for some.All in all, I give it 5/10 mostly because of the cameos, which is also probably it's weakest point since all of those still take a huge chunk of runtime just to be there pandering to nostalgia.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

He's a one dimensional actor. He lacks charisma and believability. Plus he was responsible for the script. So now he has proven that he can't act and he can't write.Someone needs to put the MCU out of its misery.

Instead of trying to hide how awful a script and movie was with practical effects they used comedy. Plot and story made kinda no sense. Didn't see like a clear goal to this movie.

1520,1.0,24-Jul-24,"For starters, I don't love the Deadpool movies but I have enjoyed the first two as I thought they were solid fun superhero movies with some clever moments. Deadpool & Wolverine has some good moments but honestly, compared to the previous movies, the quality has kind of dropped.Deadpool and Wolverine clearly is fan-service which isn't a bad thing because fan-service can create good crowd-pleasers. This movie does carry good chemistry and energy between one another that creates a fun action movie with good uses of thrills and stunt work and solid performances from the entire cast members. It was nice to see Deadpool and Wolverine going head-to-head and teaming together.Unfortunately, this is the kind of fan-service that is pretty rough on it's edges. Because as a whole, i's writing and style is pretty much the same standard superhero movie structure. Filled with typical tropes as the usual and concepts that are a bit messy. Shawn Levy's direction was dull and the camerawork and production, at times feel a bit cheap. Including rough dialogue moments and other characters that are dull and unlikeable to care.On it's humor, compared to its previous movies, the humor didn't work for me as I personally think it has gotten a bit worse with the humor feeling like it's about references rather being creative or people thinking curse words are the best jokes ever. That kind of non-serious humor that thinks breaking the fourth wall, throwing over-used jabs, and tone that thinks it's being clever but it falls flat. Coming from the man who made Free Guy and other trash films, it's not shocker the quality of it's humor and tone has dragged.At the end, I suppose this movie just didn't work for me but for fans, this is a good entertainment.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

They completely ruined the entire concept that made Deadpool so beloved in the first place.Firstly, the humor felt forced and out of place, lacking the sharp wit and cleverness we've come to expect. The storyline was a mess, filled with plot holes and unnecessary subplots that added nothing to the overall experience.Moreover, the character development was practically non-existent. Deadpool, who was once a complex and engaging character, felt flat and uninspired. The supporting characters were equally disappointing, with none of them leaving a memorable impression.The action sequences, which should have been a highlight, were poorly executed and lacked the excitement and creativity that made the previous movies stand out. It felt like the filmmakers were trying too hard to replicate past successes without understanding what made them work in the first place.Overall, this movie failed to capture the essence of Deadpool and left me feeling let down.

1523,5.0,5-Aug-24,"I loved Deadpool. Funny, violent, dark, good (for a comic book film) story, bit of jeopardy, kind of sweet, edgy, engaging love story.I even liked Deadpool 2. Funny, still quite dark, okayish story (for a comic book film), no real jeopardy, not much in the way of emotional content, violence a bit OTT.And now this one. Deadpool and wolverine are both fantastic as usual. That's the good stuff.There are some laughs but all feels a bit forced.There is no story to talk about (usual multiverse nonsense which even though this movie is trying to make fun of it, it becomes just is dull as every other marvel movie doing it now).Far too many in jokes, cameos, easter eggs, and knowingly talking to the camera nonsense (probably because there was no plot as such, and they had to pad it out).So many repetitive, slow motion fights. The first one or two it's quite good, by the 14th or 15th is just boring. Why does every sequel think we'll just take what people liked about the original and do more of it until it fills up the entire movie and leaves literally nothing else. That will work, won't it? No.Terrible villains, usual over reliance on digital effects. Has anyone in Hollywood actually seen movies like The Raid to show how actual fight scenes can work and leave you speechless. Actually even the original Blade was pretty good for fight scenes. Here, it really is just a comic book come to life and while that's not always a bad thing, it's just getting a bit dull.The good news is, it's still a little sick (in a good way) still very funny in places and who doesn't love Hugh Jackman as wolverine. It's a shame they couldn't rein it in a bit and make something worthy of the two main characters. And it's not as bad as Thor: Love and thunder 😁🤣 although comes dangerously close for similar reasons (Thor's goats = deadpool's dog....funny once).And please Marvel bin all this multiverse nonsense...it's so so bad.

The gore had been turned up to 11 for, as far as I could tell, no justifiable reason. Stabbing someone in the junk wasn't funny the first time they did it, so it sure wasnt funny the fourth time.Deadpool has never minded killing people, but I feel the outright and brutal slaughter or people just doing their jobs was a bit out of character.

I honestly wanted to love it. But if it had been any other random 'super' movie, I'd likely have walked out.

From the MCU, it has throw away, cardboard cutout villains, an awful and jumbled plot, and an absurd and borderline offensive amount of fan service. From the Deadpool films, it has very one-note ""Can he say that???"" type of humor.This movie pretends to be bold by having Deadpool bravely poke fun at Disney. But the jokes are ultimately very inoffensive to Disney, and obviously corporate approved. It has a scene where they make fun of the multiverse, and yet the whole plot revolves the multiverse, which is a total cop out.The villain is about as simple and boring as they get in the MCU. She's also weirdly overpowered, making me wonder why she didn't just snap her fingers, killing everyone. The plot mechanics are incredibly dull, and it relies way too heavily on fan service. Almost no jokes are told, just references that are lightly humorous. And the references and endless cameos really get old quick. They are there to manipulate viewers into focusing on nostalgia, so we forget that the script is absolutely awful and generic.Deadpool & Wolverine makes me extremely sad that we will no longer get any more films in the original X-Men canon.

Then all of a sudden Cap passes his Shield to another guy -- as if that's where his power came from!Then they killed off Scarlett Johansen completely to the consternation of every girlwatcher out there. Those guys need to await Gal Godot's next Wonder Woman film!So, the Studios, collectively, take all of their really big-buck earners, and just kill them all off -- really smart idea, there, Studio-Guys! Did you all flunk grade school too?Although, it's a different story if the actors no longer wanted to play those parts. I heard Ms. Johanson say: (after some on-set horseply) ""See, this is what it's like working with these guys for 12 years!"".But then we're left with films like this? Really? This is all you've got? Studio guys need to all be fired, then have them try to sell peanuts or pencils on the street.I gave the film five stars mostly for Hugh Jackman's performance.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Deadpool 1 and 2 was also good but this...come on. All movie was a big green screen just like the other DC, marvel movies. Also these actors/actresses did much better in other movies. I think it is just a simple B-C category movie, overrated and over hyped. I did not like, never happened with me before but I thought I will leave the cinema in the middle of this movie.

And they would, and cheaper!Normally there are filler episodes in a series when the money ran out. But why o why make a filler movie? And then spend an insane amount of money to have all actors fight each other. Because it would look silly to have them sit around?Why would an immortal go fight other immortals? Because Pain is Fun? Says who?In Loki there were some good episodes, a few... This movie however recycled some of the most boring parts near the end where they got stuck in the mess they created. In fact Loki was often so bad I left my house in the absence of a movie theatre to walk out of. (I'm back.) Another thingy; it's possible to have the actors protest against the Multiverse madness, but not in a movie that is so uninspired that they need several universe to gather crumbs in, to put a trail to the end credits. Moldy crumbs like an ugly dog, or the stupidest mask in the history of super Heroes? Oh its on purpose?Hugh Jackman should play Dirty Harry, not ruin a Deadpool film. Wolverine please leave the scene.... The whole movie is a mix of watching a VHS of an old birthday party, and a bunch of ten years old kids who just saw king Kong, running around and following suit in behaving like monkeys. And some deranged adults who just saw a slasher movie slashing each other with real knives. Such Fun... No, ultra violence is not funny! No, foul language isn't either. Unless it serves a purpose.

1556,3.0,27-Jul-24,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recent Marvel movie, which I believe falls far short of the high standards we have come to expect from Marvel Studios. As a long-time fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), I feel compelled to share my thoughts on the direction in which the franchise appears to be heading. First and foremost, I must address the issue of the overwhelmingly positive ratings this movie has received. It seems to me that many of these ratings are likely paid promotions rather than genuine audience feedback. In my honest opinion, this movie does not deserve the praise it is getting. A more accurate rating would be one star, reflecting the lackluster quality of the film. The plot was uninspired, the character development was shallow, and the overall experience was disappointing. It is disheartening to see a beloved franchise like Marvel producing content that feels more like a cash grab than a labor of love. Marvel, once known for its captivating storytelling and complex characters, seems to be losing its touch. The latest movie is a far cry from the earlier MCU films that captured the imagination of audiences worldwide. It appears that Marvel is now churning out movies with back-to-back subpar stories, relying heavily on the brand's name rather than delivering quality content. The unique charm and creativity that used to define Marvel movies are becoming increasingly rare, replaced by formulaic plots and predictable narratives. In this particular film, I found the storyline to be weak and unengaging. The characters, once richly developed and multi-dimensional, felt flat and one-dimensional. There was a noticeable lack of effort in the writing, with dialogue that was often clichéd and uninspired. The visual effects, while technically impressive, could not compensate for the lack of a compelling story. As a fan, it is disappointing to see Marvel, a studio that has set such high standards in the past, produce a movie that feels so devoid of creativity and innovation. Furthermore, it seems that Marvel is prioritizing quantity over quality. The rapid release of movies with little regard for storytelling and character development is concerning. This approach not only dilutes the brand but also risks alienating long-time fans who have supported the MCU from the beginning. Marvel's strength has always been its ability to balance epic action with deep, emotional storytelling. Unfortunately, this balance seems to be slipping away in favor of flashy visuals and superficial plots. For those considering watching this movie, I would advise caution. If you have a lot of money and time to spare, you might still find some entertainment value in it. However, for those who appreciate thoughtful storytelling and well-developed characters, this movie may be a disappointment. It is a shame to see Marvel, once a powerhouse of creativity and innovation, resort to such uninspired content. In conclusion, I believe that Marvel needs to take a step back and reevaluate its approach. The studio must return to its roots and focus on delivering compelling stories with well-developed characters. It is not enough to rely on brand recognition and special effects; the heart of Marvel's success has always been its storytelling. As a fan, I hope to see Marvel regain its former glory and continue to produce movies that captivate and inspire audiences around the world. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts. I hope that my feedback can contribute to a constructive conversation about the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1557,5.0,15-Aug-24,"The movie was disappointing and of low quality. It's difficult for me to understand how the demands of the younger generation have shifted so drastically. The film lacked a coherent story, meaningful message, or purpose. It seems to cater to a generation raised on unrealistic expectations, driven by video games, superpowers, and violence.I'm not suggesting that the past was inherently better-every era has its own strengths and weaknesses. However, it's concerning to see how this generation seems disconnected from reality, growing up with diminished values, less education, and a greater tolerance for violence. Perhaps we, as a society, are partly to blame for this shift.I can't help but worry about the future. Will the next generation be even more immersed in violence and fantasy, abandoning education altogether? In a world where books have been replaced by movies, it's crucial that films guide the younger generation toward a better future, rather than simply offering mindless entertainment filled with violence.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

In reality that is the multiverse in first place? Even after loki and all other movies that touched on multiverse, the structure still doesn't seems to be clear, it seems like marvel can do anything, logically or illogically it doesn't matter, because we still have no idea about the new world(new rules), kill that charter than take him back again redo it whatever they want, they even recover characters from 20 years old movies!! Like in some point that is not a twists and shock for audience it just a huge mess, and that is not the only problem with deadpool and wolverine story, it was so obvious that there is no main event it is just stuffing, i want to avoid spoilers so i won't mention anything, by the way the ""void"" is a complete joke lol.To be honest i enjoyed the first one hours, the comedy part of the movie was good as expected from deadpool but in the end it is an action movie, the movie completely failed to get me attracted to the main story or main plots, at some point i was really fighting sleep.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

He is allowed to play a character without much substance, even if it is Wolverine.The only thing I will say critical is that Disney should look at movies like ""Men in Black"". It's a movie that gets away with being adult toned but also teen friendly. It tells a clear and concise story without all the glitz and glam. I think movies today rely too much on visuals, familiar faces, and how much they cram into a movie in the time allotted (thus neglecting a clear plot).

I think it desensitizes people to violence. Moreover, the story line was implausible, not that Marvel cares much about that. Also, tiresome, the constant use of the ""F"" word was tiresome.Lastly, the director and writers didn't seem to know how to end this sorry spectacle. I kept thinking the movie was over and was ready to bolt out of there, but then another scene would get tacked on and then another. My take on this film may reflect my age and the fact that I've seen many great movies in the 70's and beyond.

However, this latest offering is a perplexing departure from the formula.The crux of the issue lies in Deadpool himself. The character, once a complex anti-hero grappling with mortality and loss, has been reduced to a grating caricature. His incessant chatter, while previously endearing, now feels like a relentless assault on the senses. The Wolverine character, too, is a shadow of his former self. His transformation from brooding anti-hero to reluctant sidekick is jarring and unexplained.The plot is a haphazard concoction of tired tropes and forced humour. The villain, Cassandra, is a one-dimensional antagonist whose motivations are as clear as mud. The constant barrage of self-referential jokes and product placements feels more like a desperate attempt to fill screen time than genuine wit. The multiverse concept, once a promising avenue for exploration, is squandered on predictable twists and turns.The film's saving graces are few and far between. The cameos are enjoyable, and the canine companion offers a welcome moment of respite. Yet, these are mere distractions from the film's fundamental flaws. The action sequences, typically a Marvel strong point, are lacklustre and repetitive. The overall tone is jarringly inconsistent, veering wildly between juvenile humour and attempted seriousness.In conclusion, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a disappointing misfire. It squanders the potential of its beloved characters, offering little in the way of compelling narrative or character development. The film's reliance on cheap laughs and forced cameos is a disservice to the franchise.

Still, I decided to watch this film because I knew Deadpool was the quirky anti-hero, and that Hugh Jackman did a good Wolverine. I wasn't expecting much going into this movie, but even so I was disapointed.First of all I just did not not connect with any of the characters. All of Deadpool's friends seem to harken back to previous installments that I did not watch.It felt like the two protagonists nothing at steak either. Sure the their home universe was being unraveled or whatever, but because there was a multiverse, they could just go to a new one.Deadpool is invincible and Wolverine is regenerative. They had some clashes with eachother, but it was always obvious that they would come out OK.The story was a mess. It just felt all over the place. I think the multiverse setting is really getting tired in these Marvel movies (and Deadpool even jokes about it in this movie too). After Deadpool found a cooperative version of Wolverine, I didn't really understand why he had to go to the void and team of with some of the superhero has-beens.And even the actions scenes, which one would expect to be bombastic in a superhero movie, felt a bit uninspired. There were a few too many instances of impaling or otherwise injuring somebody's genitals for it to remain funny for me. On the topic of the movie's humour, I thought it was cringey. I get that the writers are trying to portray Deadpool as an edgy character with his explicit humour, but it wore thin on me. With every new quip about cocaine or homosexual acts, they became less shocking.Overall I didn't think this movie had any redeeming qualities. Even adamantium Wolverine seemed weak and cripled by alcohol addiction. The overreliance on cameos in this movie had me feeling completely lost at times.

With my level of Marvel expertise, I can say that the first Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr. And Gwyneth Paltrow was a nice movie.This movie, on the other hand, was not just bad. It was shockingly bad. No character development. No plot development. What you get is the endless and pointless in-jokes for the sake of filling up time, lots of F-Bombs and blood and gore that doesn't serve any purpose.An hour into the movie, I realized that nothing was happening in terms of the plot. I would have left the movie theater if it weren't for the boys watching.Then I saw these fighting scenes between the Wolverine and Deadpool and the one with many Deadpools and I thought that this movie is celebrating blood and gore for no reason. There is violence for the sake of violence that doesn't serve any particular purpose of the genre.As I watched these drawn-out scenes, I paid attention to the public reaction in the movie theater. While some claim that this was humor, you wouldn't hear anybody laughing during those scenes.This movie is an example of what's wrong with our culture in the recent years. We give movies R rating for the curse words and glorify violence. There are movies that tell a compelling story where violence is part of it. This one - it's a celebration of violence for no good reason. If you took the blood and gore away and cut the movie down in length by 50-75%, you would still walk away with the same essential understanding of a dumbed-down overly simplistic plot.I asked the boys what they liked about the movie when the ordeal was over. They knew about Marvel movies a lot more than I did. They referred to the in-jokes. So, really, are you prepared to sit for 2 hours watching a movie where nothing is happening in terms of plot twists and just listen to the in-jokes?Please give me back the 2 hours of my life.I am deeply disappointed that this tasteless parody of a film could be so successful at the box office. If this is the epitome of all the comic-book character movie-making, if this is where the evolution has taken us, then it's a really sad world we live in.Remember the movie called Idiocracy? Well, in some ways, we are past that level of hopelessness.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1593,3.0,26-Jul-24,"After watching this, I don't think this movie has what it takes to save the MCU. It was actually surprisingly disappointing, and this is coming from someone who actually liked Deadpool 1 and 2, with 1 being the best to me.The movie lacks good pacing. I constantly got bored because the movie was all over the place. I kept wanting to look at my phone. This movie seems to care more about fanservice and cameos rather than telling an actual good cohesive narrative. As a result, this movie lacks the heart of Deadpool 1 and 2, especially 1. Deadpool 1 narrative was actually surprisingly good and well paced, and it actually knew how to be serious and emotional when it needed to be serious and emotional. I lowkey got a little choked up from the rain scene where Deadpool was hesitant to show his new face to his girlfriend for the first time but couldn't do it. But as for Deadpool and Wolverine? Just too much cringe jokes and bad chaotic pacing for me to take any the small ""serious"" scenes serious. This barely feels like an actual movie to me, feels like a bunch of skits loosely put together for a movie. Maybe I'm old-school, but extreme fanservice, constant nods, and cameos were not enough to please me. I need an actual well-structured story with good pacing.So does the comedy itself enough to make up for the lack of story and pacing? Not really! The comedy fell flat for me for the most part. Deadpool 1 and 2 were much funnier. Sorry, but I found most the jokes just cringe or corny. My theatre was mostly silent. There was a few actual funny moments, but it wasn't nearly enough overall.The action was just okay! There was no real stand-out fight scenes. The action was EXTREMELY CGI heavy and just didn't look that great. Deadpool 1 looked SO MUCH BETTER! Deadpool 1 had shocking low CGI for a modern superhero movie now that I think about it, and it looked amazing.I really wanted to like this movie but sorry I gotta be honest. I highly doubt this is quality enough to save the MCU, it's one of those movies everyone will forget in a month or so. This movie NEEDED A LOT of work! I should've known, since third movies are very rarely good. I really think it's time to drop this tired multi-verse nonsense.Deadpool OG was like a surprisingly good romantic comedy disguised as a superhero action movie. Deadpool 2 was just classic action Deadpool. Deadpool 3 was just fanservice above everything.My ratings for all Deadpool moviesDeadpool- 9/10 Deadpool 2- 8/10 Deadpool 3- 4/10.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

There are a stack or cameos with a few that really surprised me. Cassandra Nova is a great protaganist, but it was all a bit too much Mad Maxy for me. I am sure many purists will like the homages paid and I am sure it will sail past a billion dollars, but I can't help thinking it was a missed opportunity.

Ryan as deadpool is sublime as always and sometime you wonder if it is Ryan or deadpool behind the mask and Logan looks and acts the part but the problem lies in the story which is just another pathetic cash grab on a largely prepubescent minded audience. The jokes work but the story plods along and there is little to look forward to except when these two cool actors say their lines. Not recommended and the tedious story will make you want to leave but hey you paid for the ticket so you would rather suffer through the mind numbing storyline. No no and no.

You know that moment when you're already in your pajamas, ready to go to bed, but everyone decides that the night isn't over yet? Well, that's what happened to our favorite wolverine. ""Logan"" gave us an epic conclusion, where we saw our hero take his last breath and the surviving mutants finally escape to freedom. A dignified, emotional and final farewell.Then, out of nowhere, they decided to bring back Wolverine, like that friend who comes back from an exchange trip with a suitcase full of useless trinkets. No need, guys, really.

From start to finish, this movie is a painfully drawn-out exercise in futility that leaves audiences yearning for their lost time.Firstly, let's address the plot - or the glaring lack thereof. The narrative is a chaotic jumble, an incoherent mess that fails to provide any semblance of direction or purpose. It felt as if the writers simply threw together random scenes, hoping the sheer presence of the titular characters would suffice. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.The humor, which should have been a saving grace given Deadpool's reputation, falls disastrously flat. The jokes are stale and forced, lacking the sharp wit and cleverness that made Deadpool's previous outings enjoyable. Instead of laughing, I found myself cringing at the awkward attempts at humor that consistently missed their mark.The film's pacing is another major flaw. It drags endlessly, turning what should have been an action-packed, engaging experience into a tedious slog. Scenes linger unnecessarily, stretching out moments that add nothing to the story - if you can even call it that.To say I want my time back is an understatement. Deadpool and Wolverine is a prime example of wasted potential. With two iconic characters at their disposal, the filmmakers somehow managed to deliver a forgettable, lackluster experience that fails on almost every level.

The only sector that justifies my 3/10 star review is probably Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine who is constantly angy, which I believe is true because of his anger and his disgust of how he let himself participate in this - kind of - movie.

The jokes are ""meh"" and it could be because we've seen this two times before but it was mostly because there wasn't much going on to make into something funny.These recent Marvel films suffer from the inability to keep a story flowing. They lack rhythm. Sure, someone plugs plot details into a plot generator and out pops this mess.With that said, Hugh and Ryan do a fantastic job acting. The best parts of this film are the love letter to Fox, and what they contributed to the franchise. Sure it wasn't always the greatest, but a lot of people did put hard work into them.We had to learn what NOT to do somewhere, and it appears Disney has yet to learn NOT to substitute the flow of a plot and story, for the convenience of Corporate Systems of governance.It kind of sucks, but at least Deadpool 2 had the best character to ever grace Mutant Comic movies; that is Domino.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

I mean, Deadpool's funny and Wolverine is cool, but they just felt like two dudes hanging out, cracking jokes with no real reason to be there. It's like they replaced a script with a wish list of cameos. Don't get me wrong, seeing (insert random cameo) was a kick, but it didn't make up for the fact that I had no idea what was going on.

1638,2.0,1-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a highly anticipated crossover that ultimately fails to deliver on its promise. The film attempts to combine the irreverent humor of Deadpool with the gritty intensity of Wolverine, but the result is a disjointed mess that falls short of both characters' previous outings.The plot of ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is one of its biggest weaknesses. It feels hastily thrown together, lacking the coherence and engaging storyline that fans have come to expect from both franchises. The narrative jumps from one contrived scenario to another, with little regard for character development or logical progression. This lack of a solid plot foundation makes it difficult for viewers to become invested in the story or care about the characters' fates.The humor, a defining feature of Deadpool's character, is another area where the film falters. While the previous Deadpool movies were celebrated for their sharp wit and clever meta-commentary, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" relies heavily on silly, lowbrow jokes that often fall flat. The humor feels forced and out of place, detracting from the overall tone of the movie. Instead of the clever, self-aware comedy that fans love, we get an overabundance of juvenile gags that wear thin quickly.In comparison to the previous films, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" lacks the polish and attention to detail that made its predecessors stand out. The character interactions, which should have been a highlight given the strong personalities of both Deadpool and Wolverine, are awkward and uninspired. The film fails to capitalize on the potential for witty banter and meaningful exchanges between the two iconic characters, leaving viewers disappointed.The action sequences, while visually impressive at times, do little to salvage the film. They often feel like a series of disconnected set pieces rather than an integral part of the story. The lack of a compelling plot and meaningful character arcs makes it hard to care about the outcome of these battles, reducing their impact.Overall, ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" is a missed opportunity. It struggles with a weak plot, relies on humor that doesn't hit the mark, and falls short of the standards set by the previous films. Fans of Deadpool and Wolverine may find moments of enjoyment, but as a whole, the film fails to live up to its potential.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1640,5.0,11-Aug-24,"Although it's not the only problem with this movie, the double combo punch of time travel and multiverse nonsense destroyed my interest in this movie and Marvel in general. Time travel has been overused for years. Yes, some stories were interesting but it is a fantasy which has become more of a crutch. And we now have the multiverse thing added in. It was fun for a while with sliders but, like time travel, it's become a cheap trick. The MCU now uses both time travel and multiverse elements is a very messy way.So I haven't been that interested in DP2 due to the time travel aspect. And DP&W, along with Marvel in general, with the combination of time travel and multiverses has become nonsensical. There wasn't much else of interest in DP&W either. I am OK with gore when it fits in the plot. But there is so much in this movie which was clearly there just for spectacle. And most of the dialog and jokes were not interesting nor funny.In the end, this movie was actually depressing. I could have done or watched something which was actually interesting or fun.

1641,4.0,25-Aug-24,"After each Deapool movie, I wind up thinking ""Where can they go from here?"" There's something about the formula with this character (aka Ryan Reynolds breaking the fourth wall while making vulgar jokes and grotesquely killing people) that guarantees diminishing returns. Every time Wade Wilson shows up, the stakes feel lower and I care a little less. The story almost seems beside the point now; everybody is too busy making jokes and explaining plotlines to tell a real story. That said, I did laugh a bunch. If you tell enough jokes, some of them are bound to land. It is basically Spider-man: No Way Home but with dick jokes and exploding heads. But for all our wondering about what would happen when the MCU and Fox merged, the answer seems to be that you get the best and worst of both. And that means we're still stuck with multiverse movies that spend all their time explaining things and then undoing the things they just explained. Plus, look at this cameo from someone who used to be in our stories! Hugh Jackman takes it seriously and the suit looks great, but that alone doesn't justify a two hour runtime even if you make sarcastic quips about the runtime throughout the movie.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1642,4.0,27-Jul-24,"Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) promised to be an explosive addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), uniting two of Marvel's most beloved and notorious anti-heroes. However, despite the high expectations and tantalizing elements, the movie fell short in several critical areas, leaving fans with mixed feelings.Plot OverviewThe central plot revolves around Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) teaming up to save Deadpool's universe from being obliterated by a formidable new villain, Mr. Paradox, and his devastating weapon, the Time Ripper. Mr. Paradox is on a mission to ""snip off"" dying universes, and Deadpool's universe is next on his list. The story had the potential to be a gripping tale of heroism and sacrifice, but ultimately, the execution lacked the necessary impact.Main Characters and PerformancesVillains and AntagonistsSupporting Characters and CameosThe movie features a slew of cameos from notable Marvel characters, including Elektra, Gambit, Blade, X-23, and Johnny Storm. While these appearances were meant to excite fans, they felt more like superficial additions rather than integral parts of the story. Each cameo was brief and lacked meaningful interaction with the main plot, which could have added layers to the narrative.Action and HumorThe movie excels in delivering high-octane action sequences and humor. The banter between Deadpool and Wolverine provides many laughs, staying true to Deadpool's unique style. The fight scenes are well-choreographed, showcasing the characters' abilities and teamwork. However, these elements alone were not enough to carry the movie.Plot Execution and StorytellingThe film's main storyline - the mission to save Deadpool's universe - promised a significant impact on the MCU. Yet, the resolution of the plot felt anticlimactic. Despite their efforts, Deadpool and Wolverine's actions resulted in minimal change, with only one universe being saved and no substantial alterations to the overarching MCU narrative. This lack of significant consequence undermines the movie's stakes, leaving viewers with a sense of missed opportunity.Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) is a film that delivers on humor and action but falls short in storytelling and character development. The inclusion of numerous cameos and nostalgic elements like Wolverine's yellow suit provides momentary excitement but fails to contribute meaningfully to the plot. The film's central mission to save Deadpool's universe lacks the depth and impact needed to feel consequential within the larger MCU. As a result, fans are left with a movie that, while entertaining in parts, ultimately does not fulfill its potential to ""save the MCU.""While Deadpool's humor and Wolverine's nostalgia hit the right notes, the movie needed more substantial plot developments and deeper character explorations to truly resonate with audiences.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1652,1.0,14-Aug-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" had the potential to be a blockbuster, bringing together two of the most beloved and iconic characters from the Marvel Universe. However, the film feels like a missed opportunity, coming across as disconnected and poorly written. While there are moments that may appeal to hardcore fans, the movie, on the whole, struggles to find its footing, leaving casual viewers feeling unsatisfied.Wolverine, on the other hand, is portrayed in a way that feels disconnected from the character's previous iterations. The brooding, conflicted hero is replaced by a version of Wolverine that feels more like a supporting character than a co-lead. The dynamic between Deadpool and Wolverine, which could have been a highlight of the film, lacks the chemistry and depth needed to make their interactions meaningful. Instead, their relationship feels superficial, with the film relying on cheap thrills and action sequences rather than meaningful character development.Dialogue and HumorOne of the most disappointing aspects of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is the dialogue. The film is riddled with cheap, one-liner jokes that lack the cleverness and wit that fans have come to expect from Deadpool. The humor often feels forced, as if the writers were trying too hard to replicate the success of the previous Deadpool films without truly understanding what made those films work.Wolverine's dialogue, too, suffers from a lack of substance. His character is known for his terse, no-nonsense approach, but in this film, his lines are often reduced to generic tough-guy clichés. The dialogue fails to capture the essence of who these characters are, making their interactions feel hollow and unengaging.Direction and PacingThe direction of ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" contributes to the overall sense of disconnection in the film. The pacing is uneven, with scenes that drag on too long interspersed with abrupt action sequences that feel out of place. The film struggles to find a rhythm, leaving viewers unsure of what tone it is trying to achieve. Is it a dark, gritty superhero drama or a lighthearted, comedic romp? The film never seems to make up its mind, resulting in a jarring viewing experience.Catering to Hardcore FansWhile ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" may not work for the average moviegoer, it does have moments that will likely appeal to hardcore fans. The film is peppered with Easter eggs, references, and callbacks to the comics that only the most dedicated fans will appreciate. However, even these moments feel like a crutch, as if the film is leaning on fan service to compensate for its lack of substance. For those who are deeply invested in the Marvel Universe, these nods to the source material may provide some enjoyment, but for others, they do little to enhance the overall experience.ConclusionIn conclusion, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a film that falls short of its potential. The disjointed plot, lackluster character development, and cheap dialogue make it a disappointing addition to the Marvel franchise. While hardcore fans may find some enjoyment in the film's references and Easter eggs, casual viewers are likely to walk away feeling underwhelmed. This movie is a testament to the fact that even with beloved characters, a film needs a strong story, well-crafted dialogue, and thoughtful direction to truly succeed.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1653,3.0,1-Aug-24,"""Deadpool and Wolverine"" attempts to blend the irreverent charm of Deadpool with the brooding intensity of Wolverine, but ultimately falls flat with its reliance on cheap action and humor. While the idea of pairing these iconic characters promises an exciting ride, the execution leaves much to be desired.One of the most glaring issues is the film's CGI. Despite the high stakes and explosive action scenes, the special effects feel disappointingly low-budget. From poorly rendered explosions to unconvincing character animations, the visual spectacle is marred by a sense of cheapness that detracts from the immersion. The scenes that should have been awe-inspiring instead come off as lackluster, failing to live up to the standards set by previous superhero films.The gore, a staple in both characters' narratives, is equally uninspired and tasteless. Rather than adding to the intensity or emotional weight of the story, it feels gratuitous and poorly executed.The humor, which is supposed to be one of Deadpool's strong suits, falls into a similar trap. The film is saturated with cheap jokes, with about 90% relying on sexual innuendos and crass humor. While Deadpool is known for his irreverence, the over-reliance on this type of comedy quickly grows tiresome. Instead of clever wit or genuinely funny moments, viewers are bombarded with lowbrow humor that fails to elicit more than a few chuckles.In summary, ""Deadpool and Wolverine"" is a disappointing entry in the superhero genre. With its cheap CGI, uninspired gore, and overwhelmingly sexual humor, the film struggles to find a balance between action and comedy, leaving fans longing for the days when these characters were handled with more care and creativity.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

Meanwhile the people sitting next to me seemed to be having the time of their life, so maybe this movie just wasn't for me.I found the aesthetics ugly. None of the characters were attractive, despite the actors not being bad looking in real life. The backgrounds were ugly too. Too mechanical looking and too orange.The villain, as in all Disney movies, was an emotionaless Brit who spoke with a complete lack of intonation. (Is it even politically correct to continuously portray Brits as boring prudes? It's 2024. We're supposed to be passed stereotyping like this).Anyway, that aside. If someone asked me to summarize the plot of this movie, I couldn't do it. Some sort of fixing a world, time device thing? I had no conclusion to anticipate. It was just like every other Marvel movie, no real beginning, a bunch of CGI violence, and an end but this time with the witty jokes of Ryan Reynolds.A lot of gay insuations from Deadpool towards Wolverine that never went anywhere. If you're going to go that route in the dialogue, I expect some action. A make out scene between Deapool and Wolverine definitely would've made this movie more original and more entertaining.All in all, if you like movies that are just mindless fighting with no plot and witty jokes, you'll probably like this.If you like movies that have substance in the way of a plot and with characters whose emotions you can feel/connect with, this movie is not for you.All in all, this movie was mid.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

For the most part, morally sound individuals who try to do the right things and help others. Reynolds has been intentionally endeavoring to belittle and demean the whole universe and all its characters. He seems oblivious to the fact that Stan Lee's morally sound heroes have consistently been tremendous role models, especially for young people. He seems fixated on perverting the whole thing.

1669,2.0,10-Aug-24,"Legitimate question here, did artificial intelligence actually write this movie? Its a legitimate question because the shallowness, idiocy and perplexingly nonsensical jokes could not possibly have been written by people who just got done with a rather lengthy strike in Hollywood. In fact they sound like jokes from a script that someone has been sitting on for quite a while considering the gap between Deadpool 2, and this third installment. No offense, but if this is modern comedy in an action fantasy film, please place it back in the oven or grab as its not done yet. Only the most dedicated mouth breathing casual audience could possibly find anything entertaining in a film where half the jokes are bad computer animated fight sequences with lame 80's (and unfortunately newer) pop songs playing in the background. How groundbreaking, since apparently if you did this in a little movie called ""Suicide Squad"" (both if we're honest) people think its kind of garbage. Not unlike Paul Rudd's career, Ryan Reynolds has seen his heyday pass him by as well, since his claim to fame is ""those deadpool movies and insurance commercials,"" what a legacy Ryan. Yet, here he is the one cracking a joke at Paul Rudd's equally dead franchise i.e. Antman. How brave. Worse than the overwritten dialogue is probably the odd dichotomy of having to both pretend Wade's deadpool actually cares about anything between all the offensively unintelligent jokes at I suppose whatever the AI algorithm came up- like this gem:""You know what? You're a ******* joke. No wonder the Avengers didn't take you or the X-Men, and they'll take ******* anyone. I mean, you are a ridiculous, immature, half-wit moron. I have never met a sadder, more attention-starved jabbering little ***** in my entire life, and that says a lot because I've been alive for more than two hundred ******* years! And I'll tell you, that bald chick was right about one thing: you will never save the world. You couldn't even save a relationship with a ******* stripper! Mother******, I wish I could say you'll die alone, but it's one of God's best jokes that you can't die! Except that's on all of us! You got nothing to say, mouth?""This enormously out-of-touch speech is the most overwritten, pretentious, fourth wall breaking trash I've ever heard or read in my life. These characters have so little actual growth, that they have to invent some lame speech for Logan to present to Deadpool, even when he has little reason to know any details of Wade's life, or his accomplishments prior to this film (almost like they forgot to mention those two other movies or something). Here-in lies the problem with a movie where two of the main characters have to be blank slates in order for the script-writers to do anything. Cameos galore cannot save a movie where the two main characters learn nothing about each other, babble insane lines that don't even rationalize their own behavior since we are only aware of them from previous franchises, which the writers are relying on so they don't have to do any actual heavy-lifting. All the 70 year old Wesley Snipers in the world can't save your dumb buddy cop film with cheesy one-liners, cartoon violence computer animation, and disgusting tonal dissonance whenever some lame song that plays at Walmart all day comes on as if it means anything at all.You can say I ""don't like fun,"" but I've seen these movies, they've been coming out for years and they have no other direction to take except for maybe self-parody. There were so many lame jokes about Disney and Fox that only some corporate suit knowledgeable about rights issues, licenses, marketing and IP's could have suggested them to the AI. Cowboy films also became their own walking parody, so much so that an Italian director ended up making some of the best Cowboy films ever made (and the cheesiest too). The fact that people are still slow to understand the idea of ""Sphaghetti super hero film"" as long as it has someone recognizable in it, tells you a lot about our current generation of movie-goers and their expectations. The bar is pretty low, but luckily the collective memory of goldfish isn't dictated by how many of them are in one fish-tank. Over 20 years ago, X-men was popular because it was doing something different, that was when comic book sales weren't completely on life-support like they are now. Yes, its sad, but they had it coming, and like-wise so do movies starring 70 year old ""Blades"" spouting the same terrible lines he made infamous so long ago that I forgot they were even remaking Blade. If you do not take time to humanize these characters, develop good stories for them (like Logan) and rely on parody, you will end up stepping into the same quicksand Marvel slipped into. The adoration and money comes from bamboozled fans from somewhere, but I doubt even they are capable of currently connecting the dots when it comes to the generally insufferable tone these movies are going for now.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

All you're left with a poorly written film which is bloated with pointless cameos, Easter eggs and substandard special effects. If seeing other MCU characters turn up for 30 seconds makes a good movie in your opinion then you'll probably love it. But it felt like fanfiction written by a 13 year old for the majority of the duration.The part where the film shines is the interactions between Deadpool and Wolverine, but the actual plot is ridiculous, there is no real sense of peril and the resolution is neither interesting or satisfying. The movie also felt about 40 minutes too long. Have never been bored in a Deadpool film before, but I was last night.It's a real shame as the Deadpool films have always been so left field and entertaining but this just felt packed with typical Marvel bloat, pomp and a lack of any real jeopardy.Sincerely hope that there is no Deadpool 4 and am shocked to find myself writing that.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

If u saw the movie I think you'll understand my disappointmentWolverine here is no more than a side kick at best. I wouldn't be surprised if I knew that his whole script reached Hugh Jackman on a bunch of sticky notes or something. There's no character depth, no relatable motives, rare scenes of good acting, just a couple max . I really hope the money was good Mr Hugh coz I'm relentlessly failing to understand the reasons why you might have thought this is a story worth telling! I mean you ended Wolverine on a legendary high note with ""Logan"", this one is so sadly underwhelming! Even that simple title is so hilariously misleading it should've been something like ""Deadpool(s) & Co"" or maybe ""Deadpoolers' wet dream"" or something. Even the SciFi aspect of it is as expected from Marvel so outlandishly un-relatable entirely based on that multiverse hoax they're fond of, might as well do a story on flat earth!The overarching message of the production team all around the movie was ""We're the company that created so many other stuff you loved earlier, that has to be enough for you guys to like whatever BS we throw at you, right?"" You can see that message in the amount of out of context cameos, the Easter eggs, the soundtracks of other movies jammed in out of mood scenes, even in the closing credits, they just shove other movies' bloopers and BTSs that till now I fail to fathom their relevance.

The blood soaked fighting just reminded me of a comedic cartoon. I kept watching to see if there would be some kind of a serious plot and a suspenseful rest of the movie, but it just never happened.

1678,5.0,2-Aug-24,"With the overall positive reviews and promise of being Marvel's only superhero movie of 2024, I hoped I'd enjoy it. I also like the wolverine character and found some enjoyment from Deadpool in the past. Particularly in the first Deadpool movie. However in spite of some of the jokes being funny, I overall was not very entertained. I'd say a big reason for this is that there felt like there were even fewer real stakes for the superhero characters than normal. Both could regenerate. And everything else was so hammed up as part of comedy, that there didn't seem to be a lot of care for me in any of the character. Not only did they not seem to be real or in serious danger, but they didn't seem to analogous to something or someone that mattered to me either.The easter eggs were relentless in a bad way. They did the multiverse thing again. And it really seems to make it so anyone who dies feels like they were just a video game character losing one life rather than losing the entire game. The only one that I thought did the multiverse idea particularly well was Sony with the Spider-man and the Everything Everywhere all at once movie. I think this is because the stories were a bit more ambitious, original and cartoonish in style, and they made each interaction of each universe unique enough to each matter to the viewer and feel indispensable from one universe to another.This movie will not age like fine wine even if you enjoy it now. You probably won't enjoy it much in 10+ years. The 4th wall breaks are part of the style and identity of Deadpool. But perhaps they should have been relegated to one movie or at least had a few more of Deadpool's established original friends be part of his journey in this movie. That way there could be some more stakes for them rather than for others.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"

And the acting was good.But this final version of Deadpool and wolverine, is just a chaotic bunch of mixed together edited together comedy sketches, that belong in tv commercials or one the comedy central .But not on the big screen. There is like no storyline whatsoever in it yeah sure the description says otherwise 🤔.But what's supposed to be the story all I seen in the movie, was him looking for a wolverine, and killing everyone on his path . And 90%of that was cgi animated bull..t.

1684,5.0,10-Aug-24,"Deadpool. It's like watching the Naked Gun movies killing Leslie Nielson's career all over again, except this time with Hugh Jackman in DeadPool. The thing with Hugh Jackman, though, is that he is the white Denzel Washington, and no matter what he does or how it's done, he will create movie magic. He's just that great an actor. Not even Ryan Reynolds's curious foray into the dark side of movie magic can diminish him, but boy, did he try. In this movie, Ryan brought back some great cameos onto the screen (no spoilers here) that seemed to expose a not-so-cynical side to him. He seems to have a positive leadership vein and a seemingly cumbersome drive to advocate for others. This may be how he became so successful with Boost Mobile, his leadership, his compassion, and his promotion of others. However, Ryan has a dark side to his comedy that he apparently thinks about a lot and he has developed this entire Deadpool franchise around it. But I do not believe that is who he is, and I am pretty sure Blake tells him that regularly. He's not that dark, angry, cynical guy from which this Deadpool character was carved. The movie's whole premise is that he wants to be beloved and accepted into the Marvel Universe.Ryan Reynolds is a natural comedian with a God-given talent for comedic timing on the level of Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner, and Tim Conway, all wrapped in one. Maybe that's a little generous, but I do like Ryan. But unlike in his business ventures, in the movie realm, he doesn't seem to listen to the other voices in the room or to focus groups. Someone undoubtedly said to him, enough with the stabbing and the blood. It's boring. It's not even juvenile. It's something from a deep, dark place in him that he wants to put in our faces, along with imagery of sexual trains and bulging pockets, if you know what I mean. It's pointless. It's not funny to youngsters either. The only funny part for youngsters is that I, as a parent, would take them, my kids, to a movie displaying such images. For such a talented comedian, it's baffling that he is stuck on these galling images.If Ryan Reynolds chooses to use his talents to create Deadpool sequels in the likes of the Naked Gun series, it would be welcome in my home. Even the Naked Gun sequels had sexual innuendos and comedic physical comedy bits parodying this sexual act and that sexual act. One that comes to mind is when Detective Drebber was on top of the wheelchair scientist ala 69, and they went careening down the stairs. But it's all about how it's done. It was a funny scene that went from bit to bit and just got more outrageous as it went on. In this movie, Ryan has his hand stabbing one guy in his buttock from behind and the other hand stabbing another guy into his genitals, and then he rocks back and forth. It was all overdone, with nearly a minute of watching that. And that's 5 minutes (or more) into this scene, with all the stabbing and blood flying around. It's just ridiculous. Don't waste your time. It seems as though Ryan Reynolds has surrounded himself with yes men when he was making this movie to the point that no one could even tell him that enough is enough with the stabbing and the blood. Maybe the yes-men thing works in building a business, but maybe not so much in movie making-just a thought.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1685,5.0,14-Aug-24,"""Deadpool & Wolverine"" had the potential to be a thrilling blend of action and humor, but unfortunately, the creators opted to rely heavily on excessive swear words and blasphemy, which detracts from the overall experience. The overuse of this crude language doesn't add depth or wit to the dialogue; instead, it feels like a cheap attempt to shock or entertain. This choice reflects more on the creators and those who enjoy such content than on the actual quality of the film. The movie falls into the same category as many Hollywood productions that prioritize profit over substance, catering to fans without moral values and good taste. It's disheartening to see talented actors and iconic characters reduced to this level, where the focus is more on pandering to a particular audience than delivering a film with genuine creativity or depth.

1695,4.87,28-Jul-24,"I was anxious to continue watching movies, to see if this would calm him down.Yisus Marvel is similar to the real Yisus in that it always promises to come back but never arrives.You can continue to make jokes about penises and anus, break the 4th wall and point out what you are doing, which is just what you have done before and yes dear nerds, let's do that ooagain but raised to the cube and then 3 lines of Inca dandruffThe film is based on that, and on the 20 years of history of the MCU, which as in the comics to understand most things you need footnotes about which comic or character they are referencing, that of course is a delight for fans who can take the meme of Captain America or Dicaprio and say ""I understood that reference"".At what point did the history of the MCU become more important than the history of the movies themselves? The point they've reached is that the story really is the least of it and as Ryan Reynolds would say, each one is a long trailer for the next and so on.The best, the end credits with behind the scenes of the death Fox's films and the cameos of course.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1696,4.87,17-Aug-24,Reynolds is good with his quick wit. The film is too long but hollywood just wont stop doing that.Unfortunately wesley snipes and jennifer gardner are in it too.Disney adds the usual political messaging but in a more subtle way usually except a few scene where its blatantly obvious feminist agenda which distracts from the story of course but the executives think we need to hear it again and again.Overall I enjoyed it and I dont like this genre or disney at all.The fight scenes are over choreographed and too long but I guess some people like that?I suspect they let Ryan ad-lib a lot which was a good idea to let someone who is naturally funny come up with dialog rather than the union wirters.,"July 26, 2024 (United States)"

1699,4.87,26-Jul-24,"I liked this movie. I liked this movie a lot. The cameos, the Wolverine, jokes, action, villain was ok. But many aspects were very great. But just not for a supposedly epic marvel comic book movie.Deadpool and Deadpool 2, in my very novice IMDb amateur opinion, were phenomenal comic book or superhero movies! Case in point cable and juggernaut! I still can't speak enough of how epic those two films were. But this Wolverine and Deadpool movie, even with all the pizazz, could not quite measure up to those movies. I think the reason it couldn't was due to the far fetched script. It was just too out there.But seeing Wolverine and Deadpool together on the screen was great. However, I need more than a team up to make a movie a success.Lastly, why does Ryan have to make so many jokes about men? Are the comics like that? Anyways, great comedic movie. Enjoy!","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1700,4.87,1-Oct-24,"TL;DR: turn off your brain for 2 hours & pretend to be entertained.I actually believed they would've pulled off somewhat of a masterpiece. But this was 2 hours of shameless, pitiful fan pandering with little to no focus to everything else that should matter to a so-called super-action flick. Story and combat.It falls short on both. Plot is lame as hell, with the uber-predictable ""save your universe from extinction at the hands of Skeletal Bald 5-foot Chick villain of the week at the 11th hour"".And when the narrative isn't blatantly sucking off Wolverine, it just serves a never-ending Exposition train & lame telegraphed one-liners about how bad Marvel has been doing, taken directly from Instagram comments of random people with 0 posts and private profiles.The fight scenes are below par with far too much focus on close-quarters combat, which is probably due to their ages - Ryan is almost 50 and Hugh is nearing 60.And the cameos. Well, I don't know Ryan's history with everyone else but the return of Wesley Snipes as Blade, considering the bad history between the 2, seems like a Pity Job designed to humiliate the man now that Wesley is in the movie that Ryan is in charge of, instead of the other way around. Making him smile like an idiot donkey at the end was far too obvious.After all we all know how fake-nice guy Ryan treats those he doesn't like, made apparent by showing the famous Avengers 2012 action shot that gets cut off abruptly just before it shows Black Widow - Ryan's real-life ex who he heavily resented because she's a successful independent woman and he's an extremely insecure little man. Hence why he married a nobody after her, so he can be the star of the family.Quite ironic seeing how it's fairly obvious Ryan's star is fading fast. Nothing he's done outside Deadpool in the last 10 years is ever mentioned. Which is perfectly reflected in DP3. A stale, unfunny nostalgia act. And if this is what it takes to gross over 1 billion at the box office in 2024...cinema is well and truly doomed.Ryan's fragile ego might as well have left in the Captain Marvel & She-Hulk cameos because it's not like they would've made the movie any worse than it actually is. He managed that all on his own. I'm glad Marvel/Disney put their foot down and stonewalled him on releasing the bonus footage he wanted to show off to please his ego. Know your place, little man.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1701,4.87,28-Jul-24,"Subjectively, I understand the title as ""Fun enough, but too meta"". However, that's for everybody to decide for themselves.I accidentally paid for this movie twice. I selected a wrong day the first time around and before I noticed my mistake, the movie was already over. So, it doesn't really matter what I think, I've already voted for this thing with my wallet.First of all, kudos to everyone involved, especially Bob Chapek (this wouldn't be greenlit without him). I know it wasn't easy to get all these people and IPs together.Humor: Three times the same gets old. It's like Jack Sparrow - he's fun but his jokes get stale after a few movies. I loved H. J. and R. R. play against each other though.Immersion / 4th wall: There's no 4th wall, no immersion. Hence, there's ironically no breaking of the 4th wall.Characters: There are no characters, only actors. Hence, you are never really concerned for their safety. Nobody died during the production to my knowledge so there was no need to be concerned.Plot: The same thing as above. This isn't the usual story movie, this is a commentary about the current state of things in Disney and Hollywood. You could watch a Doomcock video just as well. On that note, the whole project was a nod to the HiSHE video for Logan.Soundtrack: None, if I remember correctly. Just a random collection of pop songs, as usual.In the end, it's all about what you want from this. Does it deserve 8+? For me, absolutely not.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1702,4.87,12-Aug-24,"Try to ignore much of the bad reviews, it is readily apparent many of them have never read a Deadpool comic, and are strictly comparing Deadpool 3 to Deadpool 1 and 2. Yes there is a lot of 4th wall breaking, and there may or may not be a plot, depending upon how you see it, and there is an abundance of cameos. But, news flash, that is how Deadpool is. To those who take the time to look outside of the films, and to comic book fans, pick up a Deadpool comic. He is in every universe. Personally I enjoy when he teamed up with Tom Sawyer, the times when he changes history, or when he killed every MARVEL character, (at least a few dozen times).The point is, don't look for plot in Deadpool. He was driven insane, and I am saddened and amazed that Reynolds hasn't been able to show the multiple voices in his head yet, (there are at least two aside from his usual personality portrayed in the films), and having multiple 'pools is par for the course of accurate portrayal of the character. This is a film written by Deadpool fans, for Deadpool fans, and for people to learn more about the character. The film was fantastic.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1703,4.87,3-Oct-24,"The first 2 movies in this trilogy had a great collection of misfits including ones without super powers such as Dopinder, Peter, the blind lady and the bar man, plus some comical super powers such as ""luck"" which set these movies apart from the typical Marvel movies.Sadly what we have here is very close to a typical Marvel movie. They should have just called it ""The Wolverine (and Deadpool)"". Sure we have Ryan Reynolds addressing the audience directly, taking jabs at Fox and Disney etc, but with so little of the team from the first 2 movies we just have Ryan Reynolds gushing over Hugh Jackman for nearly 2 hours with your typical X-men style plot. Ryan is supposed to annoy only the characters in the movie, not the viewers too.There are enjoyable moments in the movie, but I was hoping for Deadpool 3, not Wolverine 10 and the whole experience seems a sellout.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
1704,4.87,3-Oct-24,"Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is living an empty life after breaking up with Vanessa. The Time Variance Authority captures him and Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) intends to destroy his universe. He escapes and recruits the worst Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).The Multiverse strikes again. My first impression is that none of this matters. There is an infinite number of everything and there is no stakes in any of this. As the movie goes on, I find some fun in Deadpool pulling references and not treating the multiverse so seriously. Then comes all the old movie versions and it's fun nostalgia. I started hoping that Deadpool would end the multiverse. If I have a vote, that's the next movie. Feige could be the big bad and Deadpool could burn down Marvel headquarters. After that, they would have to restart the MCU.","July 26, 2024 (United States)"
