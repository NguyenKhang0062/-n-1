0,0,6.0,"Jun 11, 2023","Most of this movie is boring, even when there is action on the screen. The first 1h30 should have been cut to an hour, and it would have been more entertaining. Up until this point, it was a middling 5/10 for me, just like the rest of these movies (bar 1 perhaps).

HOWEVER, the final act/fight is honestly stellar - I actually sat up and properly enjoyed the battle, the fact that the people were actually involved (due to what I thought was a pretty neat, if cliché device).

It actually felt like there were some stakes too, both on large and small scale. The music, both soundtrack and needle drops were on point.

1,1,6.0,"Aug 30, 2023","As a neutral, I went in there with no real expectations. Regardless of the critics out there, I have personally enjoyed it. There is a new direction along with some exciting new characters and overall it was fun viewing.

I felt the storyline was simple and comprehensive and the chemistry among the characters were solid. To be honest though, it may not be everyone's couple of tea. Especially for people who may have enjoyed the earlier versions of it.

Nevertheless, the action sequences were ok, they are plenty room of improvements and at times it lacked innovation. Despite this, the introduction of Anthony Ramos was interesting and he didn't disappoint in his performance.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience but don't expect too much fireworks from this movie, looking forward to see how this franchise unfolds !","June 9, 2023 (United States)",as a neutral i went in there with no real expectations regardless of the critics out there i have personally enjoyed it there is a new direction along with some exciting new characters and overall it was fun viewing i felt the storyline was simple and comprehensive and the chemistry among the characters were solid to be honest though it may not be everyones couple of tea especially for people who may have enjoyed the earlier versions of it nevertheless the action sequences were ok they are plenty room of improvements and at times it lacked innovation despite this the introduction of anthony ramos was interesting and he didnt disappoint in his performance overall it was an enjoyable experience but dont expect too much fireworks from this movie looking forward to see how this franchise unfolds,POSITIVE
2,2,7.0,"Apr 9, 2024","I usually don't write movie reviews. Since, I liked all previous 'Transformer' movies, I just couldn't stop myself from writing this one. The autobots and maximals did not fail in their visual effects and performance. What made the entire storyline weaker was the two lead roles They delivered quite a lacklustre performance. Was the director/producer trying to bring diversity to the plot? Every minute of watching them was making the movie taste bland. The onus is somewhat on the screenplay.and direction of the movie.

3,3,7.0,"Jun 9, 2023","After the success of 'Bumblebee' I was hoping that this instalment might offer a more rewarding viewing experience than the previous cash grab Transformers outings, but I was sorely mistaken. It is unfortunately a rather drab affair.

Within about 5 minutes every cliche possible is ticked off the list. The dialogue is grating and so corny it hurts. The action is messy and disorienting. The newly introduced 'Maximals' are severely wasted with limited screen time. The plot centres around a silly doohickey that is hard to care about. The human characters are kind of annoying and poorly written. None of the humour really lands and neither do any of the emotional story beats. The story sags a little in the middle. I could go on.

Saying all that, this film is mildly entertaining and does have its moments, although they are too few and far between. I guess it's worth watching if you are into your Transformers films, but the casual movie goer should probably save their money and skip this one.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",after the success of bumblebee i was hoping that this instalment might offer a more rewarding viewing experience than the previous cash grab transformers outings but i was sorely mistaken it is unfortunately a rather drab affair within about minutes every cliche possible is ticked off the list the dialogue is grating and so corny it hurts the action is messy and disorienting the newly introduced maximals are severely wasted with limited screen time the plot centres around a silly doohickey that is hard to care about the human characters are kind of annoying and poorly written none of the humour really lands and neither do any of the emotional story beats the story sags a little in the middle i could go on saying all that this film is mildly entertaining and does have its moments although they are too few and far between i guess its worth watching if you are into your transformers films but the casual movie goer should probably save their money and skip this one,NEGATIVE
4,4,7.0,"Jul 29, 2023","6.5/10 Well at least it's better than the Bumblebee movie and way better than Revenge Of The Fallen, but Rise Of The Beasts still hasn't have that epicness of both story telling and action combined like the Michael Bay version and yes i still much prefer those one say whatever you want, it just my opinion, i did have a problem with Rise Of The Beasts from Dominique Fishback bad acting, Pete Davidson's Mirage characters that are just annoying and loud at times, the decision of making Bumblebee sort of die again for like a thousand time (Spoiler!

I don't know who wrote the script, but it was awful also. Nothing against the actors, but some of them seem so miscast in their roles. The girls voice was absolutely annoying. Sometimes over acting, sometimes not acting at all. But all in all just terrible. Sometimes great dialogue can say bad acting, in this case, the dialogue was just as bad. Cringe worthy.

6,6,4.0,"Jun 9, 2023","After being disappointed with Age of Extinction, loathing The Last Knight, and being one of the few that disliked Bumblebee, I went into this movie expecting it to be terrible. But I am ecstatic after watching the best Transformers movie since Dark of the Moon.

I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking ""Transformers are so damn cool."" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot and frame. The action is miles better than the last three entries.

They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.

There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don't even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.

This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they're taking. It's a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.

EDIT: I loved it even more the second time. Multiple action sequences give me goosebumps, similar to how I feel when watching the Dark of the Moon highway scene and the Optimus rage scene at the end. And I can't believe I didn't mention it originally, but the musical score is AMAZING. It elevates every scene and gives me the feels.

7,7,6.0,"Jun 9, 2023","I have to start by saying that I was not expecting much from this movie so I'm thrilled with joy about how much I got from it. I think I'm bias because the movie takes place in 1994, a good year for me and a good time for music which was used very effectively to give you a vibe of New York (or rather Brooklyn) in general. I will be blunt on how the Black and Brown culture meshing with the Transformers also realty gave the franchise a breath of fresh air. It's strange how that works. Black and LantinX has existed forever yet somehow putting it in a movie franchise about giant robots from space gave it a uniqueness that gets attention.

As Martin Scorsese would say ""it's a roller coaster ride"", but I love roller coaster rides. The Action was fantastic beautiful visual scenes but I'll admit my one nick pick would be don't see it in 3D. The format flattens the visual effects making everything look faker than it already is.

Also love the interaction of the humans and Transformers. The Transformers have more personality now than they did as basic background for Michael Bay's film.

Plus, there are some bells and whistles that truly put the smile of the 8-year kid on my face.

The lead up is solid, not great but not terrible either, but this movie really shines at the end.

I can also understand why some would rate it higher. I don't know what political stuff other reviewers are complaining about. There wasn't any in the movie, that I saw.

9,9,8.0,"Jun 8, 2023","While this film isn't groundbreaking it gives fans of the franchise some hope of a resurgence. The film takes place in 1994 and it lends itself to that time period with the music choices and the aesthetics of New York. Anthony Ramos's character was that of a stereotypical Latino from New York. In the film he's down on his luck searching for a job to help his single mother take care of his ailing younger brother. While out trying to make money illegally he gets caught up with the transformers who are trying to retrieve an artifact.

Ramos is funny in his role and his chemistry with Pete Davidson (Mirage) works well. There was a point in the film where he took charge of the situation and it came off as a bit forced. Overall, I enjoyed his performance and what he added to this film. The direction of his character during the final battle added to the entertainment of this film.

Dominique Fishbacks's character started off interesting but by the time the film ended she was underwhelming. More could have been done with her character.

Dean Scott Vasquez was okay as he added a bit of humor but some of his scenes that were meant to be emotional weren't as touching as the film tried to make them.

The landscapes of Peru were very beautiful to see and it was nice seeing the action taken away from the city. The character designs were nice but some of the characters were underutilized (Cheetah, Rhino...). The beasts were shown here and there but it felt like a very surface level introduction. The villain had a clear-cut motive which helped carry the story.

In all this film was a decent introduction to these new characters with room for improvement. I look forward to the next film and hope they can capitalize on what they started in this film.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",while this film isnt groundbreaking it gives fans of the franchise some hope of a resurgence the film takes place in and it lends itself to that time period with the music choices and the aesthetics of new york anthony ramoss character was that of a stereotypical latino from new york in the film hes down on his luck searching for a job to help his single mother take care of his ailing younger brother while out trying to make money illegally he gets caught up with the transformers who are trying to retrieve an artifact ramos is funny in his role and his chemistry with pete davidson mirage works well there was a point in the film where he took charge of the situation and it came off as a bit forced overall i enjoyed his performance and what he added to this film the direction of his character during the final battle added to the entertainment of this film dominique fishbackss character started off interesting but by the time the film ended she was underwhelming more could have been done with her character dean scott vasquez was okay as he added a bit of humor but some of his scenes that were meant to be emotional werent as touching as the film tried to make them the landscapes of peru were very beautiful to see and it was nice seeing the action taken away from the city the character designs were nice but some of the characters were underutilized cheetah rhino the beasts were shown here and there but it felt like a very surface level introduction the villain had a clearcut motive which helped carry the story in all this film was a decent introduction to these new characters with room for improvement i look forward to the next film and hope they can capitalize on what they started in this film,POSITIVE
10,10,6.0,"Jun 8, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts offers an exciting blend of action, nostalgia, and new characters that will engage both longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise. Directed by Steven Caple Jr. And set in the 1990s, the film introduces a fresh narrative revolving around the Maximals, Predacons, and the Autobots, which adds a unique twist to the beloved Transformer saga.

The visual effects are undoubtedly a highlight, with impressive CGI that brings the massive robots to life in spectacular battles. The action sequences are exhilarating, featuring dynamic choreography and breathtaking visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat. The vibrant settings, from urban landscapes to lush jungles, also contribute to the film's overall aesthetic appeal.

While the action and visuals shine, the plot feels somewhat formulaic. The story follows familiar patterns seen in previous Transformers films, and at times it lacks the depth and nuance needed to elevate it beyond a straightforward sci-fi action flick. Some character development falls by the wayside, leading to a few underwhelming performances.

That said, the chemistry between the human characters provides some heartfelt moments, and the humor scattered throughout the film adds levity to the intense action. The voice performances of the Transformers themselves, particularly those of the new characters, breathe life into the story and provide a sense of personality that fans will appreciate.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an entertaining rollercoaster that delivers what fans have come to expect - thrilling action and spectacular visuals. While it may not rewrite the rulebook for the franchise, it's a fun addition that continues to build the expansive Transformers universe.

To top it off the creators have decided to broaden the market appeal by suddenly cast non-white actors and play what they seem to think is cool music. Sadly, I guess it could work but man, how lazy.

The white male boss who doesn't want to give the Latino a job. And then Mirage the autobot mercilessly killing white cops in the car chase.

Then the Spanish transformer, and the Latino character is like ""Wow your spanish"" and the Spanish transformer replies ""That's racist..."" like omg... what is wrong with these writers?

And the two human hero's go into a tomb and they say: ""This is some indiana jones stuff"" and it just reads like the writers thought ""Lets have an indiana jones style section"" and then they comment on their own ideas in the script. So 4th wall breaking, but NOT in a good way.

17,17,2.0,"Jul 27, 2023","""Rise of the beasts"" but doesn't feel like a beasts was rising. 5 years of waiting a new Transformers film after Bumblebee (2018), I was expecting some Optimus Prime solo film or maybe some decent Transformers film but what we got is some mixed up faction betwen Autobots, Maximals and Terrorcons.

The problem with this film is that they introduce some of new characters but they force it into 1 hours film which is a mistake, this film should've been a 2 hours because there were new characters that we've never seen before in live action and they need some backstory about this new charactes. They only focus with the backstory about the humans which is boring because they got more screentime than the Maximals and i feel dissappointed with Rhinox and Cheetor, they have less screentime.

The transformation of robots in this film was kinda boring. In the bayverse the transformation of the Transformers feels like a slow but fast and smooth and we can see clearly how do they transform into robots. In this film the transformation was kinda fast and the CGI was kinda greyish so it's very hard to see what they transform into.

And oh god what have they done with Wheeljack. Wheeljack is such a useless character in this film. This film can work without Wheeljack. They change his design, his voice, his personality and worstly he doesn't even do anything in this film beside chasing Battletrap with Arcee.

Unicron? They should just make a movie about Autobots fighting The Decepticons because they really have a balls of steel to use Unicron in the first film Transformers in the reboot universe. I mean come on man this was a second film in the reboot universe and they just straight introduce us to Unicron. They should just do with Unicron later because this universe need more fresh story. It feels like a DCEU film when we got to introduce with Superman and then he fight Batman in the next film and then in the next film they introduce Darkseid.

The only things i like about this film is the soundtrack. Steve Jablonsky is back and he use his original Transformers 2007 theme in this film and i was surprise at the end of the film and Optimus Prime did his final speech after 6 years the last time he did his final speech in Transformers The Last Knight.

22,22,6.0,"Jun 11, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts combines the character focused approach of Bumblebee with the bombast of the previous Bay films for a great globe trotting adventure that wastes no time and strikes a much better balance in screen time given to its human and Transformers characters, even if the beasts themselves are actually surprisingly underutilized.

Anthony Ramos gives a really good lead performance, he's easy to root for and has genuinely strong relationships with Optimus Prime and Mirage. Mirage is the standout with Pete Davidson voicing the character, the constant quips never get annoying and he still has an emotional connection to Noah as well.

Peter Cullen is always perfect as Optimus Prime and this is undoubtedly some of his best work in the live action films. Its what Bay was going for in his later installments but done better, an Optimus Prime who's not the ideal leader but a selfish, broken one carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.

Steven Caple Jr.'s direction is strong overall, the fights can get a little chaotic but a second act chase and third act final battle are still a lot of fun. The music by Jongnic Bontemps wisely chooses to lay off the nostalgia for the most part, creating its own epic score and using classic pieces sparingly.

The soundtrack does a good job making it easy to adjust to the time jump and making it feel authentic and the CG is impressive overall. There's obviously a few weak spots throughout but it's still maintains that balance between realistic details and more animated flourishes.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",transformers rise of the beasts combines the character focused approach of bumblebee with the bombast of the previous bay films for a great globe trotting adventure that wastes no time and strikes a much better balance in screen time given to its human and transformers characters even if the beasts themselves are actually surprisingly underutilized anthony ramos gives a really good lead performance hes easy to root for and has genuinely strong relationships with optimus prime and mirage mirage is the standout with pete davidson voicing the character the constant quips never get annoying and he still has an emotional connection to noah as well peter cullen is always perfect as optimus prime and this is undoubtedly some of his best work in the live action films its what bay was going for in his later installments but done better an optimus prime whos not the ideal leader but a selfish broken one carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders steven caple jrs direction is strong overall the fights can get a little chaotic but a second act chase and third act final battle are still a lot of fun the music by jongnic bontemps wisely chooses to lay off the nostalgia for the most part creating its own epic score and using classic pieces sparingly the soundtrack does a good job making it easy to adjust to the time jump and making it feel authentic and the cg is impressive overall theres obviously a few weak spots throughout but its still maintains that balance between realistic details and more animated flourishes,POSITIVE

25,25,3.0,"Jul 9, 2023","Rebooting a franchise isn't easy, especially one with such beloved and iconic characters as the Transformers. However, the latest installment, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, has achieved this feat with spectacular results, making it not just a pleasant surprise, but arguably one of the best movies in the Transformers franchise to date.

A pleasant surprise for modern blockbusters is its computer-generated imagery (CGI). The quality of the CGI in ""Rise of the Beasts"" are not a muddied mess we've come to expect with modern blockbusters, and is arguably the best I've seen in a while. The Autobots, and the newly introduced Predacons and Maximals look incredible.

The narrative offers an engaging blend of the familiar and fresh, exploring further into the Transformers mythos. Long-time fans will appreciate this movie, finally seeing the Maximals on the silver screen.

However, ""Rise of the Beasts"" is not without its drawbacks. The most notable among them is a sense of disproportion in its story's elements. The movie leans too heavily on human interaction, reducing the robot action that the audience so dearly craves. We do understand the need for human characters to anchor the story and bridge the gap between our world and the Transformers'. Still, the franchise is about 'Robots in Disguise,' and we'd love to see more from these fascinating mechanical protagonists.

The third act's story seems a bit underwhelming. The plot's culmination feels somewhat lazy, like a hurried wrap-up instead of a thoughtfully designed climax. The only positive to the climax is an epic bot-bashing fight that the film should have more of throughout instead of leaning on the human element as much as it does.

But it's not all doom and gloom. The franchise appears to be on an upward trajectory, gearing up to expand its universe in the most thrilling way. The end credits scene is an electrifying surprise that creates a wave of anticipation for fans. It hints at bigger and bolder things to come, setting up future installments and universe building.

To sum up, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an exciting rollercoaster ride that impresses with good CGI and reinvigorates the franchise. Despite its imperfections, the film delivers on the promise of epic, otherworldly adventure that the Transformers brand has become synonymous with. If you are a fan of towering bots, interstellar wars, and bot-smashing visual effects, this movie is a must-watch. And remember, stay until the mid-credits scene.

The future for the Transformers franchise looks bright indeed, and ""Rise of the Beasts"" plays an integral part in this promising horizon. We can only hope the subsequent films bring us more robot action, and more of the transforming titans we love. After all, in the world of the Transformers, there's always more than meets the eye.

All this could be saved if the action were entertaining and investing. But it isn't, aside from a handful of stylish shots.

Say what you will about Michael Bay's movies. (They're bad.) But at least they had huge scale to them and the stakes were understood.

So there isn't anything atrociously bad about this movie. The writing isn't exactly lazy. There isn't any unnecessary, vulgar humour (yeah god knows what the previous movies were thinking). Transformers had gotten to a point that this alone feels nice.

The movie kicks off with a great 1st act. But it just slows down in the middle. Then it finally picks up with a nice final act.

The writing still isn't good. The human characters are still very boring and keep dragging the movie down. The character of Elena, especially, feels so unnecessary (nothing like Hailee Steinfeld's character in Bumblebee). You can clearly see from the plot that the writers are constantly looking for something for Elena to do and it feels so forced. The character of Noah is fine. There are times when I liked the direction they took with him, but there are times when it was just cringey.

But most of the time when the transformers are on the screen, it's very fun. Mirage was a wonderfully fun character and it was great to see him interact with Noah. There is also a great car chase scene with him early on. I also liked how they wrote Optimus' character. Rather than just being the big noble leader, they gave him problems to confront, which made him actually feel like a character for once. Even Bumblebee has a GREAT scene - easily my favourite scene of the movie. And the visuals were great to see. Every shot just felt very polished and colorful.

In the end, I'm disappointed but I don't regret watching it. This movie has made me believe that there is a great transformers movie out there somewhere. But it has also made me realise that I'm not going to get that movie anytime soon. This movie is another step in the right direction for this franchise, but they're walking slowly.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",did we finally get a good transformers movie no but we do get glimpses of what a good transformers movie can look like just like in the bumblebee this movie overall is fine there isnt any other word for it thankfully the franchise was rebooted after movies which saw the transformers in a very different light so there isnt anything atrociously bad about this movie the writing isnt exactly lazy there isnt any unnecessary vulgar humour yeah god knows what the previous movies were thinking transformers had gotten to a point that this alone feels nice the movie kicks off with a great st act but it just slows down in the middle then it finally picks up with a nice final act the writing still isnt good the human characters are still very boring and keep dragging the movie down the character of elena especially feels so unnecessary nothing like hailee steinfelds character in bumblebee you can clearly see from the plot that the writers are constantly looking for something for elena to do and it feels so forced the character of noah is fine there are times when i liked the direction they took with him but there are times when it was just cringey but most of the time when the transformers are on the screen its very fun mirage was a wonderfully fun character and it was great to see him interact with noah there is also a great car chase scene with him early on i also liked how they wrote optimus character rather than just being the big noble leader they gave him problems to confront which made him actually feel like a character for once even bumblebee has a great scene easily my favourite scene of the movie and the visuals were great to see every shot just felt very polished and colorful in the end im disappointed but i dont regret watching it this movie has made me believe that there is a great transformers movie out there somewhere but it has also made me realise that im not going to get that movie anytime soon this movie is another step in the right direction for this franchise but theyre walking slowly,POSITIVE
34,34,6.0,"Jun 16, 2023","I'm honestly pretty baffled how this is getting worse reviews than Fast X. It's easy to compare the two films given their release dates and long-running franchise status. After seeing these films back-to-back, I found Rise of the Beasts to be significantly more enjoyable. The first half alone is better than anything in Fast X.

Paramount seems to be course-correcting pretty well after all of the damage Michael Bay did to the brand. This and Bumblebee were both pretty enjoyable films. Yes, there's still the 3rd act bombast and spectacle, but it's a lot easier to tell what's going on in this film. The jungle setting is also quite refreshing from the endless skyscrapers in the other movies. I still don't think we need so much emphasis on humans, but it is handled much better here. The soundtrack is also lots of fun and I loved the overall 90s hip hop vibe. It's definitely a bit cheesy, but there are some fun moments in the climax that made me crack a smile.

Rise of the Beasts won't blow you away, but it's a nice, enjoyable step forward for a franchise that needed some new life.

39,39,7.0,"Jul 18, 2023","The fact that the silliest thing in this very silly movie (non-derogatory) is printed on a business card is a testament to just how ridiculous and left-field the final few moments of 'Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts (2023)' truly are. What a world we live in.

It's odd that none of the voice actors get named in the main-on-end credits, not only because they deserve to be listed alongside the live-action cast (most of whom have far less screen time) but also because there are some really big names that shouldn't be hidden in the end crawl.

This is closer to Bay than Knight, but it's by no means bad. It's a zippy, if slightly overlong, adventure that leans into its absurdities with a straight face and a steady hand. It lacks any real semblance of style or wit, but it isn't totally lifeless and it's far from the crass mess most of the movies in its series unfortunately are. The human characters get a considerable amount of play and, to be honest, they actually outshine the giant robots around them. That's not because they're especially compelling, even though they're likeable and well performed, but because most of their metallic counterparts aren't really characters so much as special effects. A couple of the autobots and maximals get more play than the others and they're decent enough for what they are, but the majority do little other than scrap with terrorcons and ominously talk about the end of the world. Even the so-called great leader Optimus Prime comes across more as a murderous maniac than a commander fighting for peace (though that's nothing new), spending most of the feature telling the intimidating main villain that he's going to kill him and absolutely eviscerating anything he can get his hands on. The film is generally rather bland and forgettable, lacking any real excitement and featuring mostly unmoving set-pieces. It takes too long for the autobots to actually get involved, too. There are a handful of fun moments and the piece is generally entertaining enough for what it is, but it does leave something to be desired.

It is not a masterpiece - that is for sure... It is popcorn cinema. It is action, without too much thought. But let's face it, in those often dark times, it is what one might need.

The story seems to be quite isolated from the stories of the previous movies. And do you know what? I actually welcome this decision. We don't need just another stretch, just that it ""works in the canon"".

And yes - the dreaded looming armageddon is again projected. Again - I would not really except anything else - so I guess it is alright.

Overall the movie offers great actions, compelling characters (even they could be developed a bit further). Long story short, Transformers: Rise of the Beast is not terrible at all.

I actually enjoyed it.

Would it be my favorite movie of all times? Absolutely not! In 2023? Absolutely not. Favorite Action movie? You are kidding!

42,42,2.0,"Jun 9, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) had a promising story that had the potential to be a great addition to the franchise. However, the overall experience was marred by the performances of the lead actors, Anthony and Dominique.

While the storyline offered an engaging experience filled with emotion and excitement, the execution fell short due to the disappointing performances of these two actors. Their portrayal of the characters lacked the depth and authenticity required to fully immerse the audience in the movie's world. It felt like they failed to connect with the essence of their roles, leading to a disconnect between the audience and the characters they portrayed.

If given the chance to remake this movie, I would prioritize casting actors who can truly embody the spirit of the characters and bring them to life on the screen. This would not only enhance the overall experience for the viewers but also elevate the film's potential to be a true blockbuster.

It is evident that the production team may have been under pressure to deliver the movie quickly, leading to some questionable casting decisions. Choosing actors and actresses solely based on expediency rather than their suitability for the roles was a misstep that significantly impacted the film's final result.

Despite the disappointing performances, it is essential to acknowledge the efforts put into crafting an exciting story that resonated with the audience. The film's production team and crew deserve credit for creating an engaging narrative that could have been truly exceptional with the right cast.

In conclusion, while Transformers: Rise of the Beasts had a promising storyline, the subpar performances of the lead actors, Anthony and Dominique, hindered its overall impact.

The good: MORE Characters! Optimus has a bit of a character arc with trust.

It has a simple plot, but it works.

The villain! Scourge was the best villain I've seen in a live action TF movie! So while we have YET to Megatron in this new reboot... he's got to be much more... insane and calculating than Scourge was here!

The actors...I will admit I did not like Elena at first but by the end she grew on me.

Did I say there were more transformer characters!?

The music (well, the incidental music anyway) was really good.

The little brother's plight added a sentimental touch and helped the main character (Anthony's)move his story arc fairly well.

The length was not overly long for a TF movie!!!!

The bad: Wheeljack's head/face. He should have just been called a different name!

The Beast characters finally get some action near the end... but we rarely got to see them in Bot mode which was a shame... Rhinox had some speaking lines... but only in a deleted scene! (ARGH!) The subtitle should have centered on Mirage. While this is not our G1 Mirage... I liked him! This was HIS movie, like Bumblebee carried his. The movie was misnamed.

The 90s stuff in the beginning was...okay. I'm sure some people will get a kick out of some pop tunes from that era (again they are trying to center the movie on maximal characters which are NOT the main cast for the sake of the time Beast Wars was on TV.)... While the 'era' was fine... the whole PC angle just left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't remember anyone with issues getting jobs during that era like that... maybe in the 1950s... but I was unemployed myself in the 90s and I'm 'whyte' as I saw many other people that didn't look like me getting jobs I waa trying to simply get an Interview for! (Anyway)... still it was that overall part of the plot (while slow to start) really picks up when someone tries to steal a Porsche... THEN it turns into Transformers! And it doesn't stop after that!!

Overall I'd watch it again easily. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad. Hope the next movie centers around Megatron. If you expect seeing Primal, Cheetor and Rhinox having adventures... nope not this movie. But still overall not a bad movie in the same vein as Bumblebee.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",okay i really enjoyed bumblebee rotb has a similar feel the good more characters optimus has a bit of a character arc with trust it has a simple plot but it works the villain scourge was the best villain ive seen in a live action tf movie so while we have yet to megatron in this new reboot hes got to be much more insane and calculating than scourge was here the actorsi will admit i did not like elena at first but by the end she grew on me did i say there were more transformer characters the music well the incidental music anyway was really good the little brothers plight added a sentimental touch and helped the main character anthonysmove his story arc fairly well the length was not overly long for a tf movie the bad wheeljacks headface he should have just been called a different name the beast characters finally get some action near the end but we rarely got to see them in bot mode which was a shame rhinox had some speaking lines but only in a deleted scene argh the subtitle should have centered on mirage while this is not our g mirage i liked him this was his movie like bumblebee carried his the movie was misnamed the s stuff in the beginning wasokay im sure some people will get a kick out of some pop tunes from that era again they are trying to center the movie on maximal characters which are not the main cast for the sake of the time beast wars was on tv while the era was fine the whole pc angle just left a bad taste in my mouth dont remember anyone with issues getting jobs during that era like that maybe in the s but i was unemployed myself in the s and im whyte as i saw many other people that didnt look like me getting jobs i waa trying to simply get an interview for anyway still it was that overall part of the plot while slow to start really picks up when someone tries to steal a porsche then it turns into transformers and it doesnt stop after that overall id watch it again easily it wasnt great it wasnt bad hope the next movie centers around megatron if you expect seeing primal cheetor and rhinox having adventures nope not this movie but still overall not a bad movie in the same vein as bumblebee,POSITIVE

The female lead actress was a bad choice and I am sure that the stuido could have found someone better and not obsessed with too much makeup and cringey acting with a few Chessy lines.

I understand that the old famous actors that made this such as Mark Wahlberg are getting old and there's a need to adjust for this and let the audiences have a taste of the upcoming actors but this wasn't a good cast except the kid,the voice actors (They did an awesome job),I will give the lead actor average but the rest of the crew weren't good in their respective roles.

It definitely drew parralles from Marvels Eternals in the first scene and the depiction of omnicron.

Highlights are a freeway autobots pursuit in South America, which could easily be cut out for a more visceral final cut editorial.

59,59,7.0,"Jul 19, 2023","The latest instalment in the transformers franchise Rise of the Beasts opened in UK cinemas last Friday and I have to say although I like to think I'm at least somewhat in the know about these things I had no idea this film existed until I saw a trailer around a month ago. Maybe I just wasn't looking in the right places or maybe the studio just wanted to get this one out and have done with it who knows. Anyway this is the what 6th film in the transformers franchise now? The franchise that gave us the great Sam Witwicky and the even greater Megan Foxes a**... I mean Michael Bay explosions 😅. None of which feature in this new film which feels like an attempt at a reboot of the franchise but with a perhaps all too familiar narrative.

This time around we are introduced to a new/old type of transformers called the Maximals who years a go fought to protect the (Google's) Transwarp key from falling into the hands of the planet consuming Unicorn... Unicron although I would like to see that film. They were successful, however in the modern day with which this film is set (early 90's) the key has resurfaced and with it Unicron and now the Autobots must team up with the maximals to stop the key falling into the wrong hands. Sounds interesting and unique to the franchise so far tight?

Well then they throw in a couple of humans who essentially take over the film even more so than the transformers themselves. The first of which is arguably the main character Noah Diaz him and his family are down on their luck and with his brother sick and the family unable to pay the medial bills the transformers offer to pay him in exchange for his help on their mission. Noah and Noah's relationship with the transformer Mirage is the best thing about this film their relationship develops more than any other in (not in that way you pervert). The second human character is Elana Wallace a historian whose knowledge is being underused and under appreciated as she is working as a secretary. Elana feels like she is in this film more so that her knowledge can be used to move the narrative along rather than as a character that you can actually seeing getting developed in potential future films. In fact I'd be surprised if we see her again outside of perhaps a cameo. For a film called transformers much like the other films in the franchise it focuses a lot on the humans and sometimes it works but other times you just wish it would get back to the robots kicking the crap out of eachother which I felt there could have been more of but when the action does kick off you really do feel like you're amongst the action so props to the sound department for that.

All in all the film feels largely like wasted potential to take the franchise in a new direction but if you enjoyed the other films I think you'll have fun with this one too. There's also a big scene at the end that hints at a potential sequel which isn't a post credit scene so more props to them for doing that.

60,60,7.0,"Dec 13, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the most entertaining and enjoyable film in the franchise since the 2007 original! I know, I know, that's not saying much, as pretty much all the sequels are nearly unwatchable. (*not counting Bumblebee, as that was very different and a much better film than all of them*) I've never been the biggest fan of the franchise, but as someone who has seen them all, it really feels nice to get an entry that I don't actively hate!

It's refreshing to finally get a Transformers film not helmed by Michael Bay, as this film does away with the juvenile humour and excessiveness of those films. Steven Caple Jr. Actually did a fine job here, considering the only other major film on his resume is Creed II. Usually, directors who don't have much experience with CGI struggle with their first primarily CGI-based film, but here Caple Jr. Managed to pull off some pretty impressive action sequences. Now, it's not perfect, as many of the visuals do look quite bland and sterilized. It actually had me longing for Bay's signature visual style, which as the very least kept everything in the frame looking quite exciting and vivid. I never thought I'd say that, especially after the god-awful The Last Knight, but Bay's direction is what really made this franchise work so well, it gave them that sleek blockbuster feel even if their stories were crap. Here, we get a decent story that managed to be quite watchable, but the direction of the action scenes made it feel like this was more geared toward family audiences. It felt smaller scale, less ""blockbuster-y"" than the rest, but I actually didn't mind that here. The film had a fun, Saturday morning cartoon vibe to it, it's like when you were a kid and made your action figures fight - which for a Transformers film is not necessarily a bad thing.

The film is indeed fun, amusing, and enjoyable... but that's about it. It's largely bland and forgettable and gets bogged down by silly exposition and cheesy dialogue. The movie really plays it safe - it's shorter, straightforward, and quite conventional. It doesn't do anything we haven't seen before so it's hard to really rave about it. Plus, the plot isn't the best, and it moves quite slowly at times, taking way too much time to over-explain exposition. But, on a positive note, the movie finally finds the perfect balance between humans and Transformers! And these human characters might be the best the franchise has had outside of Bumblebee (sorry Sam Witwicky). Anthony Ramos was quite good here, really proving that he is the real deal and deserves so many more leading roles after this and In the Heights. I also thought Pete Davidson stole the show as Mirage, one of my new favourite Autobots besides Bumblebee! He had some really funny moments that had my whole audience laughing! I was surprised to see that the audience I saw the film with was really into it, and it helped me to further invest myself in it! But overall... this isn't a movie you need to rush out to see. It's good, it's fine. It has some likable characters and some entertaining action, but it isn't revolutionary or special. I am happy to finally get a Transformers movie that does something different than the usual Michael Bay madness, and I thought it worked out well. It's just unfortunate this movie is inherently flawed. Still, compared to every other Transformers sequel from Revenge of the Fallen to The Last Knight, this is leagues better than all of those! While it is overall ""just fine"", it's a step in the right direction, and it's one I actually wouldn't mind rewatching at some point!

But my god... the reveal in the final scene of this movie made me roll my eyes so hard. Please don't tell me this is the direction they are taking this franchise in.... it would be such an unnecessary and overstuffed crossover.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",transformers rise of the beasts is the most entertaining and enjoyable film in the franchise since the original i know i know thats not saying much as pretty much all the sequels are nearly unwatchable not counting bumblebee as that was very different and a much better film than all of them ive never been the biggest fan of the franchise but as someone who has seen them all it really feels nice to get an entry that i dont actively hate its refreshing to finally get a transformers film not helmed by michael bay as this film does away with the juvenile humour and excessiveness of those films steven caple jr actually did a fine job here considering the only other major film on his resume is creed ii usually directors who dont have much experience with cgi struggle with their first primarily cgibased film but here caple jr managed to pull off some pretty impressive action sequences now its not perfect as many of the visuals do look quite bland and sterilized it actually had me longing for bays signature visual style which as the very least kept everything in the frame looking quite exciting and vivid i never thought id say that especially after the godawful the last knight but bays direction is what really made this franchise work so well it gave them that sleek blockbuster feel even if their stories were crap here we get a decent story that managed to be quite watchable but the direction of the action scenes made it feel like this was more geared toward family audiences it felt smaller scale less blockbustery than the rest but i actually didnt mind that here the film had a fun saturday morning cartoon vibe to it its like when you were a kid and made your action figures fight which for a transformers film is not necessarily a bad thing the film is indeed fun amusing and enjoyable but thats about it its largely bland and forgettable and gets bogged down by silly exposition and cheesy dialogue the movie really plays it safe its shorter straightforward and quite conventional it doesnt do anything we havent seen before so its hard to really rave about it plus the plot isnt the best and it moves quite slowly at times taking way too much time to overexplain exposition but on a positive note the movie finally finds the perfect balance between humans and transformers and these human characters might be the best the franchise has had outside of bumblebee sorry sam witwicky anthony ramos was quite good here really proving that he is the real deal and deserves so many more leading roles after this and in the heights i also thought pete davidson stole the show as mirage one of my new favourite autobots besides bumblebee he had some really funny moments that had my whole audience laughing i was surprised to see that the audience i saw the film with was really into it and it helped me to further invest myself in it but overall this isnt a movie you need to rush out to see its good its fine it has some likable characters and some entertaining action but it isnt revolutionary or special i am happy to finally get a transformers movie that does something different than the usual michael bay madness and i thought it worked out well its just unfortunate this movie is inherently flawed still compared to every other transformers sequel from revenge of the fallen to the last knight this is leagues better than all of those while it is overall just fine its a step in the right direction and its one i actually wouldnt mind rewatching at some point but my god the reveal in the final scene of this movie made me roll my eyes so hard please dont tell me this is the direction they are taking this franchise in it would be such an unnecessary and overstuffed crossover,POSITIVE

63,63,4.0,"Jun 8, 2023","""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is the new movie based on the Takara toys that Hasbro exploited and have been brought to television, movies and comics. In this new film, the result is kind of almost bad, a soulless and simple script that could have been told in 90 minutes and not in an excessive length of 127 minutes that become slow. The performances are ordinary and the director's work does not stand out. The production is not used, the soundtrack has no essence and the cinematography is quite conventional.

64,64,8.0,"Jun 15, 2023","The original Michael Bay Transformers was really fun and a modern take on the classic series. The CGI was incredible and it resulted in a film that was Bay's best since The Rock. The same can't be said about the flashy, lack of substance sequels. It was enjoyable to watch more Transformers of course, but he focused too much on mind numbing action and not enough on story and characters. There were some great moments to be found within those films, but none came close to its predecessor.

Rise of the Beasts is a return to form that excels beyond the enjoyment of the 2007 film. Anthony Ramos was stellar, and not just in a blockbuster main lead kind of way, but is truly a great actor who deserves much more screen time in addition to this series. Mirage was absolutely incredible, every minute that charismatic Transformer was on screen he lit it up and stole the show.

I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched, but if you've ever loved the Transformers at any point you will find this latest entry to be irresistible, hilarious, intense, action packed, and a solid film that uniquely places itself within the modern blockbuster genre.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",the original michael bay transformers was really fun and a modern take on the classic series the cgi was incredible and it resulted in a film that was bays best since the rock the same cant be said about the flashy lack of substance sequels it was enjoyable to watch more transformers of course but he focused too much on mind numbing action and not enough on story and characters there were some great moments to be found within those films but none came close to its predecessor rise of the beasts is a return to form that excels beyond the enjoyment of the film anthony ramos was stellar and not just in a blockbuster main lead kind of way but is truly a great actor who deserves much more screen time in addition to this series mirage was absolutely incredible every minute that charismatic transformer was on screen he lit it up and stole the show i wont spoil it for those who havent watched but if youve ever loved the transformers at any point you will find this latest entry to be irresistible hilarious intense action packed and a solid film that uniquely places itself within the modern blockbuster genre,POSITIVE

67,67,6.0,"Jul 1, 2023","I see many comments of people of one particular race complaining about the urban music, the brown actors and actress. I have watched the Transformer movies and found they all we pretty good. It seems in this particular movie it seemed to try a new audience maybe to wheel them into the franchise.

I believe the acting was pretty good, now I will say no way as good as my guy Shia. The first couple ones were great. This one seemed not as action packed and the jokes were ok.

As far a the ""white people,"" saying nasty comments about the music and how they feel targeted - As my mom says, ""Guilt will make you tilt. "" meaning if you perceive something in a certain way then that's how you feel about it.

It's your own guilt. Therefore, you may have things you need to fix in your own life. Racism does exist, I don't believe this film pointed any fingers at a particular race. I believe it stuck with the environment and area it was filmed in. It went with the narrative of what most people in that particular area go through, see and experience. Maybe you don't have those experiences, but it doesn't take away from people who do.

It's great to meet new people who are not in your ""regular circle of friends"" then just maybe people can receive the experiences of others less fortunate around them. It's great to not only broaden your horizons when it comes to exploring other places, but imagine broadening your horizons when it comes to other cultures, races and religions!

No it's not per the ""usual"" narrative, but I like that it reaches out to a different genre of people and culture, which will Intel make that particular group of people or culture want to watch the previous Transformers.

70,70,7.0,"Jun 21, 2023","Well, it's about robots from outer space so just turn your brain off for maximum enjoyment. If you told me the script was AI-generated, I'd believe it.

But is it entertaining? Depends on your definition. If you want to see robots and humans hunting MacGuffins, clashing and brawling for their respective fates, painfully cringe dialog and jokes, and a predictable plot? Then yes, it's entertaining.

I'm a sucker for 90s hip-hop, so hearing Tribe and Wu-Tang was a pleasant surprise. I also appreciate the dynamic lighting and how the robots are integrated into their environments. They don't stick out too much or look odd.

Until they talk. Then most of the immersion goes right out the window. Nearly every robot-spoken word is delivered with the gusto of the movie trailer voiceover guy bellowing cliches like ancient creeds.

And yet, as the 3rd act progressed I found myself starting to be won over, almost like a case of Stockholm Syndrome. Maybe because I stopped thinking about it. Maybe the movie itself became a visual lobotomy.

71,71,2.0,"Jun 11, 2023","LIKES:

The Pacing -The movie is good in terms of keeping the Transformers pace. It's popcorn munching goodness, without as many of the explosions and I really enjoyed how the two hours moved quickly -It's got plenty of movement to have the action genre tag to it, but yet respect the plot enough to give it time and have a little character development thrown in as well.

-A great shake of the hands, I quite enjoyed what they brought with it and did not find it as bad as the pacing of Transformers 4 and 5 in the Bay universe.

The Story To An Extent -The movie has good elements to the plot, a little more focused and brought together than what we got with the latter half of the Bay series.

-Rise of the Beasts adds some more character elements to the movie, sometimes hitting Beast Wars and other times hitting the nostalgic Transformers, with an overlap of real life drama that combines nicely.

-The human story in particular has crafted humans that I like, good morals, good involvement, and some growth that helps to integrate them into the madness that matched 1 and 2's plots but yet better.

-And the actual robot story itself impressed me with what they accomplished in helping evolve Optimus' role and what they did with Airraiser as well.

-These are the stronger elements, with Mirage also coming in with some good moments, leading to a story that isn't the strongest, or most dynamic, but is not the worst plot development that we've seen.

The Action Scene Moments -Transformers always had some degree of action no matter the medium you have watched them in, and the first movie was one of those that showed me just what we had in store for this series.

-Rise of The Beasts, has these moments, great cyber warrior action that mimics what we saw and played with the toys, but with much better special effects.

-I loved some of the moves and battles, sometimes rugged wrestling and rolling around, other times blasters blazing in a spark that could give Star Wars a run for its money.

-And the ending battle sort of brought scenes that were my expectations with coordination, moves, fighting, and stakes to an extent. The key word... extent

The Sound Editing -The movie series has always made me smile with how amazing the sound editing is.

-Bay started it, but the series continues to improve on making the Transformers changes sound even better.

-The metallic movement effects, the way the blasters and blades ring out as they hit, and even the sounds of the voices have an effect that make the speakers boom, and it's awesome for fans like me.

-And for the most part, it didn't get in the way of the dialogue. I could clearly understand and hear what the characters were saying, getting the best of both worlds together which is always nice.

The Visuals -But as impressive as all the audio work is, the visual work is still the most stunning piece of material for me in this series.

-Rise of the Beasts continues to make great strides with making the impossible come to life, and the robots continue to look good.

-The air of fakeness is still there, but it's so impressive to see the details on the group, the sheen, the scars, and the weapons come to life and make it move so good.

-Again, the first movies I think still look a tad better, but the cartoon shine does well to mix with realistic visuals and tear the Earth up so well with awesome tricks.

-It integrates so well, and I love seeing what they push the technology to, but right now, it's still one of the pinnacles of the animation in live action.

DISLIKES:

The Plot Still Needs Work -I know it's Transformers and It's not about the story at all for most, but part of what helps bind this series together is and give a meaning to the metallic bashing.

-This movie has started to improve on the plot, but it still needs tightening, focusing on a few elements and finding those means to stretch and balance all it has to balance.

-There were a lot of shift changes and convenience factors to the plot, the very piece meal plot is a bit weak in transitions, doesn't fully integrate the characters to the extent the first one did, and still is missing that finesse -Fortunately, an amazing end credit scene, and some of those shining moments help make this better, but still so much potential.

The Balance Is A Bit Off For Robot Use Still -The first movie is the one that did the best with the balance, but since then, there has been struggle to break out of Optimus' shell.

-This movie had contenders who helped stand out and do more, and that was a nice balance, but there is still room to really maximize Maximals and Autobots to make them worth the inclusion.

-For this sequel, there is still some better balance and I see more of them fighting together than the past. It's just, I wanted more and seeing some of my favorites backlogged still due to the number they have... well it kind of stinks for a huge fan like me.

-Guess there is a reason they continue to keep them in shows, so that they have more balance of characters.

More Focus On Humans Than Robots -It is Transformers, and I want to see robots more than humans.

-Yet, for some reason, they continue to put the humans front and center for the movie and continue to focus more on their journeys than the robots themselves.

-The movie does this a lot, and though again the humans are likeable, they just don't have the interest of mine when I'm there to watch robots kick butt.

-Even during the action scenes the humans got the focus disrupting things and the flow of the action scenes that I was so looking for.

-As such, the movies really need to continue to try and find a bit more balance for the robots I'm coming to watch and the real life counterparts that are there to be the ambassadors to real life. Something the end credit promises could happen.

The Action Scenes Are Choppy At Times -The first Transformers had the best flow of action for me if I'm being honest. The fighters were engaged, they came up with strategy, and there was involvement and stakes.

-The others, kind of had that, but got so lost in essentially these human drama elements, and the theatrical moments, that they often felt very shortsighted to just a few moments.

-This movie is somewhere between them. There are moments where the scenes are starting to rev up, have this awesome move set and coordination that matches the Avengers style of action.

-And then it gets interrupted, goes into talking again, and stretching stuff out that sort of cuts into the action.

-Is it awful? No. Is it cheesy? Sometimes. Is it frustrating for me? Yes. But the scenes still have more together than most of the Bay films, so I can't really be too upset but just hoping that they can find a little more balance and really go back to the roots of the first movie for me.

THE VERDICT: Transformers is very easily a theater worthy movie. It's got the style and modern day elements to really show just how good the technology is and see how smooth robotic warfare can be. It's got better use of characters, a story working to find its balance, likeable characters and character growth that tells the tale to a decent level. The visuals are gorgeous, the sound editing on top, and the action moments are decent at times when they come together in the perfect combination of these elements. Yet, the movie is still finding its legs for me and not necessarily the perfect balance of story, action, and mechanics the first one was for me. The visuals are top dollar and seem to take the point, and at the cost is the optimizing of character use, coordination of scenes, and just balance overall. Still, it's a popcorn munching flick and I was very satisfied with the fun I had with the movie and the showing I did in non-3d. But... I can only suspect this movie would rock in the Imax theater and if you can, check it out.

My scores are:

Starting from the sound of Optimus Prime's soundtrack when fighting with the Unicorn troops to the Bumblebee character who jumps from a plane with action that makes goosebumps and background music that fits it.

Why You Should All Watch And Not Watch This Movie?

It's simple, the fighting scenes between robots in this film are numerous and with lots of explosions. But it's a shame that the storyline of this film feels very fast and mundane like other Transformers storylines. I highly recommend watching this film in IMAX because you get to see big robots on a big screen with big sound. Sadly, Some of the jokes are also cringy and inappropriate for the audience.

New Characters?

Yep, they're all great and interesting like Maximals, Terrorcons, and so on, starting from the CGI to the way the characters are conveyed.

74,74,8.0,"Aug 3, 2023","If it stresses you out to refill your soda and popcorn during a good movie, no worries here. Unless it is the first fifteen minutes or the last fifteen minutes, you are not going to miss anything. This director has no track record and had no business directing this film. You do not hand the reins over to a nobody on the 7th film in a series. Terrible job little bro. Anthony Ramos and Dean Scott Vasquez did a stupendous job. Who the hell cast Dominique Fishback??? Is she some 1990's afternoon Disney castoff. She couldn't pull off an episode of Zach and Cody, let alone a triple A summer release. It was painful to watch her acting. There are no big actors in the film at all except a short stint with Luna Lauren Velez as the mother figure.

75,75,7.0,"Jun 14, 2023","Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a captivating film that blends comedy, action, adventure and drama. As a young film watcher, I was thoroughly impressed by the movie's ability to keep me entertained. One of the standout performances in the film is Mirage (Pete Davidson), who brings a delightful touch of comedy and showcases a genuine heart for humans.

The idea of the story revolves around the Maximals joining forces with Noah, (Anthony Ramos) and the Autobots as they work together to defeat the menacing Scourge (Peter Dinklage) and the Terrorcons in a battle that could potentially be the fate of the world.

Although the film takes a bit of time to build up in certain parts, it ultimately contributes to the overall experience. The camera work is flawless, providing a fresh and new perspective for viewers. Anthony Ramos delivers an outstanding performance as Noah Diaz, effectively portraying a range of emotions and going above and beyond to embody the character. Peter Cullen, the voice of the heroic Autobot Optimus Prime, presents a new side of Prime that we have never seen before, adding depth to the character. Peter Dinklage takes on the role of the perfect villain Scourge, adding a scary, creepy and dark twist to the story-a crucial element that superhero movies often need.

The message of ""never quit and keep getting back on your feet"" resonates strongly throughout the narrative. It's important to note that the film contains a significant amount of profanity.

I give Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts a solid rating of 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as well as adults who appreciate the Transformers franchise.

Summer has finally come in! After being disappointed in character-stuffed The Flash, I was delighted to see Transformers: The Rise of the Beasts, a light-hearted super-heroes' adventure based on Hasboro toys, that serves up delicious wit and ingenious robots into cars or the other way around-I can't figure that out. What you can figure out is exactly what is happening to whom, not always a characteristic of the Michael bay mix ups.

As in most of these adventures, good and bad are trying to get some magical object, here a Transwarp Key, there The Arc of the Covenant, etc. Because these talismen don't amount to a hill of beans next to the actual survival of the galaxy,

What sets this sequel, or prequel if you will, right is its willingness to have fun and make fun of the struggle to survive, for both bots and humans. While few entries in this franchise can equal Travis Knight's 2018 Bumblebee success, when director Steven Caple Jr casts Pete Davidson as a swashbuckling, smart-mouthed sports car to buddy up with lead Anthony Ramos as Noah, he establishes his difference from the stern Michael Bay.

79,79,7.0,"Jun 11, 2023","I was incredibly hyped and excited when the 'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' trailer came out. Despite the trailer not impressing me much, I held onto hope that the movie would do better. Sadly, my hopes were somewhat in vain, as the overall quality of the production fell short of the franchise's standard. At first glance, even the design of the Transformers, especially Optimus Prime, didn't seem as attractive and intricate as in the last movie ('The Last Knight'). It felt like imagining a metal box walking on two legs. The Teracons deserved a better introduction and makeover. Remember how cool and innovative Galvatron was in 'Age of Extinction'? I missed that kind of creativity.

Now, let's talk about the actors. I don't blame them, as I'm sure they did their best. However, I couldn't feel the energy, and in some scenes, they seemed rather lethargic. Perhaps bringing in an experienced actor from the past movies, like Mark Wahlberg, could have injected more action and adventure into the film. On the bright side, I personally liked the kid and his acting.

Moving on, I couldn't help but laugh at Noah's iron suit design. We've all seen 'Iron Man,' so you know what I mean. Overall, the plot felt like a fairy tale, too simplistic for a Transformers movie. The abundance of Yo Yo's and dialogue like ""Did someone ask for backup?"" felt reminiscent of kids' cartoons.

In conclusion, I wasn't entirely satisfied with this movie, and it didn't meet my expectations for a Transformers film. Michael Bay needs to carefully consider where this franchise is heading and ensure strict attention to production quality. As a Transformers fan, I'd rate this an uneasy 6/10, but I'm still hopeful that the next Transformers movie will rock the theaters. Unfortunately, it seemed like this movie was more focused on promoting equality among Americans rather than fully entertaining the Transformers fandom.

80,80,7.0,"Dec 1, 2023","Overall I laughed and had an enjoyable time, no I don't think the movie was amazing but it was a decent watch.

I think Transformers has been extremely hit or miss since the first one and this one is okay.

The story is about Noah Diaz as he must find a key to help the autobots get home, meanwhile a planet sized transformer called Omnicron is out to destroy all worlds as they feed him.

The movie has some decent action scenes, Noah and Elena are good in this their chemistry is enjoyable and Pete Davison as Merage is an amazing casting choice, he is the comedic relief which is non stop, it can get a bit much at times but there are some funny one liners and his relationship with the humans is best. I also like how Optimus doesn't love or trust the humans at first he must develop that.

I feel for the serious tone they went for was undermined a bit at times with all the jokes, the new design is good, I do prefer the bay look to most transformers but I prefer this bee.

The CGI is okay overall, some not good moments which take me out of the movie. The score was good, one thing that bothers me is that their blasters chose when they inflict damage as sometimes they do nothing while others is it's a devastating blow.

It is a family movie and I can't take that away, I did enjoy all action scenes, the finale was good, would have preferred a better location not just a dull grey rock hahaha

82,82,5.0,"Feb 20, 2024","I can't really call myself much of a fan of the live-action installments of the ""Transformer"" movies. I have seen then, sure, and found them to do what a movie is supposed to do; entertain. But I am by no means a fan of them. And thus, I also eventually found the time to sit down and watch the 2023 installment to the franchise, titled ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"".

And I sat down to watch ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" without any expectations. And turns out that director Steven Caple Jr. Delivered a movie very much akin of the numerous previous live-action ""Transformers"" movies that had come before it. But hey, if you enjoyed those movies, then you will definitely also enjoy ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"", and that has to count for something.

The storyline in ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" was pretty simplistic and straight forward, but I sort of was left with a sensation of 'was that really it?' once the movie ended. It wasn't as if there was brought anything overly new or impressive to the franchise with this particular movie. Sure, you have the Maximals and a world-eating entity of sorts. But that was about it.

Sure, the visuals in ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" are great, as they have been throughout all the live-action movies. And for me, personally, then it is the special effects that keep the franchise afloat, because the storylines are monotonous, repetitive and bland. And in this 2023, you can lean yourself back in the seat and be bedazzled by the impressive CGI.

The voice acting for the robots is good, and it certainly was nice that they added Michelle Yeoh to the voice acting roster for the ""Transformers"" franchise.

""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" certainly is a movie for the fans of the live-action franchise, for better or worse. Personally, I prefer the 1980s cartoons, and have done so since the very first of the live-action movies saw the light of day. Though, in all fairness, I did find ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" to be entertaining for what it was; spectacular CGI and a good amount of giant robots fighting.

85,85,1.0,"Jun 9, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the latest installment in the long-running franchise that features giant robots fighting each other and that for some reason cannot leave planet earth alone. The plot revolves around the arrival of a new faction of Transformers, the Maximals, who are ancient beasts that their normal form is a jungle beast of some kind (Gorillas, Cheetah, Rhino etc.). The Autobots and the Maximals must team up with a couple of human minorities (yes, that's part of the story) to stop the Terrorcons (the bad guys) from destroying the world.

As we came to expect from Michael Bay's productions, the movie is a spectacle of action, CGI, and explosions, but it lacks a coherent story, compelling characters, and emotional depth. The movie tries to introduce too many new elements and characters, but it fails to develop them or explain their motivations. The movie also suffers from poor dialogue, cheesy humor, and clichéd tropes. The movie is clearly aimed at a younger audience who might enjoy the flashy visuals and the loud noises, but it offers little to older or more mature viewers who might expect more substance and originality from a movie.

The movie is not a complete disaster, however. It does have some positive aspects, such as the impressive animation and design of the Transformers, especially the Maximals, however the different fight scenes are a bit underwhelming and do not do the character justice, for example, one of the first fights scenes add within less than 5 seconds. The movie also has some fun action sequences and some nostalgic references to the original cartoon series and toys. The movie also tries to explore some themes of identity, loyalty, and family, but it does not go deep enough or deliver any meaningful messages.

Overall, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a mediocre movie that might entertain some fans of the franchise, but it will disappoint most critics and casual viewers. The movie is a typical example of style over substance, and it does not offer anything new or innovative to the genre.

The movie follows Noah (Anthony Ramos), a former soldier and electronics expert, and Elena (Dominique Fishback), a museum intern and artifact researcher, who get involved in a war between the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), the Maximals, led by Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman), and the Terrorcons, led by Scourge (Peter Dinklage), who serve the planet-devouring Unicron (Colman Domingo). The movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. And written by Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber.

The movie succeeds in delivering spectacular visual effects, stunning cinematography, and exhilarating fight scenes that showcase the diverse abilities and personalities of the Transformers. The movie also pays homage to the Beast Wars storyline from the animated series, featuring fan-favorite characters such as Cheetor (Tongayi Chirisa), Airazor (Michelle Yeoh), Rhinox (David Sobolov), and Nightbird (Michaela Jaé Rodriguez). The movie also introduces some new and interesting Transformers, such as Mirage (Pete Davidson), a spy who can turn invisible, Arcee (Liza Koshy), a female motorcycle bot who can hack any system, and Stratosphere (John DiMaggio), a cargo plane bot who can transport other Transformers.

The movie also benefits from having charismatic and relatable human leads, who have good chemistry and humor. Ramos and Fishback play Noah and Elena as ordinary people who get caught up in an extraordinary situation, but also have their own dreams and struggles. Ramos portrays Noah as a loyal and courageous hero, who uses his skills and wit to help the Autobots and Maximals. Fishback portrays Elena as a smart and curious researcher, who holds the key to unlocking the secrets of the Transwarp Key, an ancient artifact that can transport anyone across time and space. The movie also explores their backgrounds and motivations, such as Noah's family issues and Elena's career aspirations.

However, the movie is not without its flaws. The movie suffers from having a predictable and clichéd plot, that relies on tropes such as the chosen one, the MacGuffin, the evil overlord, and the last-minute save. The movie also has some pacing issues, as it tries to cram too much information and action into its 127-minute runtime. The movie could have benefited from having more character development and emotional depth for both the humans and the Transformers. The movie also has some logical inconsistencies and plot holes, such as how Unicron can devour planets without being noticed by anyone else in the galaxy, how Scourge can control other Transformers with his tentacles, and how Noah can hack into Mirage's system with ease.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a fun and entertaining movie that will appeal to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. The movie delivers on its promise of bringing new elements to the Transformers universe, while also honoring its legacy. The movie has impressive visuals, exciting action, and likable characters that make it worth watching. However, the movie also has some flaws that prevent it from being a masterpiece.

91,91,2.0,"Jun 20, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the next instalment in the long-running franchise known for its epic battles between colossal robots and the humans caught in between. The film, directed by Steven Caple Jr., features a cast including Anthony Ramos, Dominique Fishback, Peter Cullen and Ron Perlman. The story revolves around a team of Autobots and Maximals joining forces with a human artifact hunter and a researcher to thwart the plans of both Predacons and Decepticons, who seek to unleash a malevolence of annihilation.

The visual effects are impressive, especially the Beast Wars characters who transform into animals. Fans will find joy discovering nods and hidden references to the animated series and comics. Jongnic Bontemps's score perfectly captures the grandeur.

However, similar to instalments in this franchise's history, some recurring issues persist with Rise of the Beasts. The human characters lack depth and fail to establish connections or exhibit distinctive personalities. Dialogue occasionally leans towards being trite with exposition, while jokes often miss their mark or become contrived clichés.

The direction feels chaotic and confusing, with camera work and rapid editing that make it difficult to follow the action or become invested in the stakes. The film's runtime of over two hours feels excessively long and repetitive.

The tone is inconsistent and uneven, shifting from serious to silly to dark without coherence or logic. The movie lacks depth, leaving us disconnected from the characters' experiences. It is a mindless popcorn flick that offers entertainment value but fails to leave an impact.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts may resonate with franchise fans but is unlikely to appeal to a wider audience. It is a formulaic addition to a series that has overstayed its welcome.

92,92,8.0,"Jun 8, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the latest movie of the franchise series (and I actually lost count of how many there are). Just a quick check and the first movie was way back in 2007 and of course made stars of both Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf.

This was more enjoyable than I was anticipating, it adds some new dimension with these 'Animal' Transformers and having a large part of the film set in a natural setting created a different environment as did its date of 1994.

Anthony Ramos is good as a likeable rogue mixed up in some petty endeavours who accidentally steals Autobot 'Mirage', disguised as a Porsche. These two characters give good banter and comedy, especially in the 'joyride' scene.

I found this easier to watch than other instalments I remembered as too often previously the action moved so fast often fight scenes were rendered incomprehensible. I'm not sure if they have consciously addressed this or it's just that over time the CGI has got better (and clearer), but this makes a huge difference to the viewers enjoyment.

Also the way certain characters react to the situations also feel unrealistic at times. The Soundtrack is also lacking. At the end it would have been preferable to have a composition from Steve Jablonsky instead of a ""regular"" song but I guess that's up to personal preference.

96,96,6.0,"Jun 15, 2023","Look. Transformers stopped being good after Dark Of The Moon. Ar least in my opinion. Last Knight is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The franchise, in general, threw out Transformers Lore and stomped on it. Screw you Michael Bay. You could have hired pretty much any one who was a kid in the mid 80s to help keep things square. Than we got a pretty good Bumblebee. So my expectations were huge for this movie. It didn't quite hit them but it wasn't a total let down. Personally, id like for them to just let there be no movies for a few years than do a hard reboot following the Gen 1 Cartoons and Comics. This movie is a little slow and then it gets good. First half of the movie is a little boring and spends much time focusing on the humans. We get a Optimus Prime who isn't very heroic yet. Although he does morph into the OP we all know and love. I was never a huge Maximal fan, so their addition doesn't so much for me. Like I said, I'd prefer a hard reboot. Follow the Gen 1 comics and cartoons. Eventually bring in the Dinobots, Constructions, Metroplex and my personal favorite Omega Supreme. God I'd love to see him on the big screen and done correctly.

A new Transformers movie now adding the show Beast Wars that ran from 1996 to 1999, a show I have not seen but I know about the Maximals and Predacons that is the focus of the show. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) has what we have seen before with little issues you can point out, but it was fun to watch, and Beast Wars fans will get what they want.

I liked the main human character Noah Diaz played by Anthony Ramos; he has a brother who has medical problems, he served in the U. S. Military, he steals a car, even though he is not fully ok with it. I liked his relationship with his brother, and I liked the bond with the Autobot Mirage voiced by Pete Davidson. Another human character that was not bad who joins Noah was Elena Wallace played by Dominique Fishback, working at a museum and being a history buff to help find this key for Unicron.

Optimus Prime voiced once again by Peter Cullen is cool to see with his old design from the cartoon, and the rest of the Autobots like Wheeljack, Arcee, and Bumblebee are cool to see fighting with the Maximals. The Maximals Cheetor, Rhinox, Airazor, and the leader Optimus Primal voiced by Ron Perlman who was great to see fight alongside Optimus Prime; they needed to be more in the movie, but they are cool to see when they are in the movie. The villain is one of the Terrorcons named Scourge voiced by Peter Dinklage who was a simple villain, but he was intimidating, and he works for the big threat Unicron to eat planet Earth.

The action scenes with the Autobots and Maximals going against the Terrorcons were fun to watch, and the transforming along with the effects looked good.

106,106,6.0,"Jul 29, 2023","An absolute atrocity of a movie. Transformers has never produced anything truly good, but the first couple of movies were quite enjoyable nonetheless, due to great action, some funny and some epic lines and the sheer coolness of the transformers themselves.

The newest addition to the franchise adds nothing except even more totally-not-transformers (the dinosaurs were too much already, why add jungle beasts? Just why?). The dialogue is unbearably bad, the storyline is laughably predictable and simply boring, and while the idea behind both human leads might have been good at some point in the planning phase, both fall flat.

110,110,7.0,"Jul 13, 2023","This wasn't a terrible movie by any means. It was definitely kind of underwhelming though, and didn't do anything to convince me that this franchise, that I do like (only like the first 3 to be honest; I hate 4 and never saw all of ""TF: The Last Knight"" or any of ""Bumblebee""), needs to continue still. This is the now seventh movie. Even with me actually really liking the third act, and thinking that Anthony Ramos did a really good job as the lead, I don't desire more of them. ESPECIALLY not with the way that it ends, setting up a crossover with another franchise. To reiterate, I enjoyed Anthony Ramos very much in this. I liked his character and actually cared about him, and his relationship with his little brother. I enjoyed their dynamic together. And the young actor who plays the kid brother also was very good. And it was great to see Lauren Velez again, even though she appears very briefly in it as their mom. I thought the voice cast for the Transformers was mostly fine also. Some of the movie also was shot in Peru, where most of the back half of the movie takes place (The beginning takes place in New York). The location of Peru is just beautiful. There are some wonderful shots in here. Steven Caple Jr., who directed ""Creed 2"", did a very good directing job here as well. Where I'm honestly mixed is the performance by Dominique Fishback. She's decent in the movie, but some of her acting isn't great. I don't know if that's because of her trying to act against what are essentially VFX characters and trying to sell that, which I imagine isn't easy to do. But I wouldn't call her great against actual actors either. She's not like on the level on Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in the 3rd film, who was not good. Megan Fox wasn't great in the first 2 either. Nicola Peltz in Age of Extinction wasn't good either. Same thing. She's trying though. In regards to her character, I like that she is smart and is knowledgeable about artifacts and things. And she was used within the main story. But if you take her out of the movie, and rework a few things, I'm not totally sure I'd miss her that much. Not that she was a bad character. I just found Ramos's character more appealing. She was fine. Something was just kind of missing with her character, though. Also, although I again liked the Ramos character and his performance, I still don't understand why human characters have to be in these movies. The Transformers should be the exclusive focus. The beginning of this movie and the battle sequences at the end (taking exception to the intercut parts with the humans) paint a really cool picture of what an entire TF movie could be with just them, or at least could've been. I would have loved a Transformers film to have that sense of scale and ambition. Nothing against human actors, but make this about the Autobots and Decepticons alone. Another thing that I didn't know about this was that it takes place in the 1990s, specifically 1994. Had it not been for the year itself coming up on the screen, and some movie posters, a clip from ""Juice"", and the most obvious thing being the songs on the soundtrack, I wouldn't have even guessed that it was supposed to take place in the 90s. There is no real sense of time or place here in this. The decade is not really relevant at all. There's even a modern song that plays during the third act and another modern song during the end credits. They don't even stick with the 90s theme, lol. As far as the VFX go, they are still mostly good but inconsistent at times. There were one or two close-up shots on Optimus Prime transforming that did not look all that good to me, and another close up on Optimus Primal later in the film that didn't look too good. Lastly on what I'm mixed on, the action is just really more of the same but even less impressive than it used to be. These are giant robots, so it makes sense that they don't always go down easy, but I got a little tired of all the shooting and hitting, and nothing was really happening. I was like ""Ok, can somebody get damaged?"". The best portion of this movie for me though in regards to action, visuals and even somewhat character was the third act. I could see myself rewatching just this section of the movie alone for how much it engaged me. It isn't better than the finales in the earlier Bay films to me, but it was fun and well done, I thought. Now my biggest gripes come from two things in particular. One is a character, who while they mercifully have very little screen time in the film, the time that they had was enough. There's a character who is a friend of the Ramos character. He's basically a lowlife criminal. I haven't seen this actor before, so maybe it's just what they gave him, but his character was the most annoying character in the entire film. He's our comic relief human. Pete Davidson voices ""Mirage"", who serves as our comic relief Autobot. Pete was here and there in terms of effectiveness, but the friend was not funny at all. I think back to him yelling out of the window of his car, and I laughed but now I really wanna know why I did that. That wasn't even funny. Was it a pity laugh? I guess. They tried way too hard to make this guy funny and likable, and failed at both. When he leaves, so does the thorn in my side. He is briefly seen again before the end, and during a mid-credits scene (which is lame). Also, the plot is basically the same as all the others. They have to get something before the bad guys do, and they fight over it for 2 hours. This time, it's a ""key"". Some things I honestly don't even remember (not that I want to tell you everything to ruin it for you), but its just super-basic anyway. The movie's ok. But I don't think I need to see it again.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",this wasnt a terrible movie by any means it was definitely kind of underwhelming though and didnt do anything to convince me

111,111,1.0,"Aug 19, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts makes its way into the cinematic universe with a mix of excitement, novelty, and some familiar faults. Though not the most stellar installment in the franchise, it must be acknowledged that the movie does attempt to contribute fresh perspectives while balancing its obligatory action sequences.

The beasts, a new element in this universe, are unquestionably a strong aspect of the film. Their introduction brings an intriguing twist to the Transformers saga and gives a much-needed break from the traditional Autobots and Decepticons dynamic. The CGI and special effects team did a commendable job with their designs, bringing life and a raw energy to the 'beasts' that effortlessly command attention on the big screen.

The cross-franchise connection with G. I. Joe injects further intrigue, although it is currently more of a curiosity than a significant plot point. If this link is cultivated carefully in future installments, it could lend some valuable synergy and shared universe depth that many franchises strive for.

Unfortunately, the film falters with its human characters. The lead actress's performance is noticeably lacking. It's not that her performance is terrible, but it never truly shines or makes the audience invest in her journey. There's a certain spark missing, causing the character to fall flat in comparison to the dynamic and visually stunning robots.

Another area of concern is the handling of character stereotypes, specifically the Latino character who is introduced as a thief. Although he eventually evolves into a hero, the initial clichéd depiction is a reminder that the film industry can still rely too heavily on such tropes. The attempt at diversity is commendable, but execution is key to avoid perpetuating negative stereotypes.

At its core, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a solid action flick. The action sequences are well-choreographed and the beasts keep the franchise feeling fresh. But do temper your expectations, this is a movie you might enjoy more without expecting groundbreaking storytelling or cinematic brilliance.

While it falls short of being a great film, it doesn't land in the category of 'bad' either. It's a decent watch, especially for those interested in high-octane action sequences and the nostalgia of Transformers. It might not rise to the top, but it doesn't entirely sink into mediocrity either. On a scale of 1-10, it earns a respectable 6.5 for its efforts.

The Good:

CGI is finally decent and clear. It doesn't have the older movies' confusing ""on your face"" action. We can finally understand what's going on.

It wasn't boring. It had good amount of balance of action, adventure and humor.

The BAD:

Story and writing is very bad. If you want to revive the age of ""one liners"", hire Arnold. It looks and sounds corny when robots do it, and unfortunately, there were a ton of them.

Characters were bland. I didn't care about them. Without giving spoilers, I really didn't care who would win in the end.

Too many aspects of the scenes were ""inspired"" from some other successful movies. So much that I could guess exactly what would happen and exactly when they would happen by remembering those movies.

In the end, even though there were some nice steps in the right direction, I believe it is time for the producers to spend some of that CGI money to hire some decent writers.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",im writing this review as someone who watched all the transformers movies and someone who loved the series when i was a kid the good cgi is finally decent and clear it doesnt have the older movies confusing on your face action we can finally understand whats going on it wasnt boring it had good amount of balance of action adventure and humor the bad story and writing is very bad if you want to revive the age of one liners hire arnold it looks and sounds corny when robots do it and unfortunately there were a ton of them characters were bland i didnt care about them without giving spoilers i really didnt care who would win in the end too many aspects of the scenes were inspired from some other successful movies so much that i could guess exactly what would happen and exactly when they would happen by remembering those movies in the end even though there were some nice steps in the right direction i believe it is time for the producers to spend some of that cgi money to hire some decent writers,NEGATIVE
119,119,7.0,"Jun 24, 2023","""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is the latest installment in the popular franchise, and while it doesn't quite match the excitement and spectacle of the original movies, it's still an enjoyable action-adventure film.

One of the strengths of ""Rise of the Beasts"" is its diverse cast of characters. The film introduces a new group of Autobots and Decepticons, as well as some human characters who are more than just one-dimensional stereotypes. The movie also takes place in a new location - Brooklyn, New York - which adds a fresh perspective to the series.

While the special effects are impressive and the action scenes are thrilling, ""Rise of the Beasts"" can sometimes feel a bit formulaic. The plot is fairly predictable, and some of the jokes and references may feel a bit tired to longtime fans of the franchise.

That being said, the movie still manages to be entertaining and engaging. The action scenes are well choreographed, and the battles between the Transformers are epic and visually stunning.

120,120,6.0,"Jul 11, 2023","Set in 1994, with Maximals from ""Beast Wars"", ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" will please both long suffering fans and newbies of these robotic creatures that morph into everything from cars to apes.

Those of us who've been there since the beginning will really enjoy the obscure references to other movies and animations in this generational franchise.

The MacGuffin in ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a KEY which naturally is broken and scattered all over Earth and it literally holds the key to the planet eating Unicron (Colman Domingo from ""Fear The Walking Dead"") nefarious deeds, which are managed by his faithful servant ""Scourge"" (Peter Dinklage ""Game of Thrones"").

The bad news is one of your favourite Autobots actually dies in this movie...so keep the kleenex tissues handy.

However, we get a new on-screen character ""Mirage"" (comedian/actor Pete Davidson) who states at one point that Marky Mark (the stage name of Mark Wahlberg) is getting into acting. Die hards know Wahlberg played Cade Yeager in two previous ""Transformers"" movies, Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Transformers: The Last Knight (2017).

Pete Davidson based his performance as ""Mirage"" on his favourite comic actors Jim Carrey (specifically The Mask (1994)) and Adam Sandler and you can hear it in the cinema.

And according to Director Steven Caple Jr., the Porsche 964 that ""Mirage"" transforms into was specifically chosen as a tribute to ""Transformers"" director Michael Bay's previous film Bad Boys (1995), where the two main characters Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett rode around in a Porsche 964.

As a professional Voice Actor myself with numerous credits in Games (""Soul Catcher -Protector"", ""Stick Wars 3 - Folklore"" etc) this is where I'm going to get my nerd on.

History has been made with ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" with Voice Actor Peter Cullen who was 81 at the time of this film's release, making him the second-oldest actor to voice a Transformer.

The oldest is George Coe, who voiced Wheeljack in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), and was 82 at the time of its release.

Meantime academy award winning Michelle Yeoh voices Airazor, making her the second Oscar winner to voice a Transformer, after Orson Welles as Unicron in The Transformers: The Movie (1986).

Three Oscar nominees have voiced Transformers in previous films: * George Coe as Wheeljack in Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) * Ken Watanabe as Drift in Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) * Angela Bassett as Shatter in Bumblebee (2018) Ok back to film reviewer mode.

Scourge's truck mode resembles the villainous truck from Duel (1971), which was directed by Transformers executive producer Steven Spielberg.

The Transformers insignias from Scourge's victims on the grill reference the license plates on the earlier truck, which Spielberg said belonged to the victims of the truck driver.

On a rare note this is the first Transformers movie that has no Decepticons.

Instead the villains are all Terrorcons.

Watch out for: the Final battle scene it's as epic as Marvels.

VFX by Wetta are amazing.

Industrial Light and Magic were actually benched for this movie.

Actor, Anthony Ramos as ""Noah Diaz"" is a rising star in his early 30's with so many credits to his name already including ""Honest Thief"", ""Hamilton"" and ""In The Heights"" he is a triple threat singer, dancer & actor whose landed on his feet as part of this latest trilogy.

Wait for the end credits: this film features the first live action crossover with another huge franchise that had previously only crossed over in comics and animation.

Parts of this international, globe-trotting movie was filmed in Peru at a popular tourist spot with ancient history that connects into the epic (over 2 hours long) storyline as the Autobots join forces with the Maximals in the battle to save Earth exploding or being eaten by Unicron.

123,123,6.0,"Jan 15, 2024","The Transformers movies are clearly not the most Shakespearean films out there, but if you ever went into one hoping it would be, I'm sorry. I thoroughly enjoyed 2007's Transformers (and still do), 2011's Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and 2018's Bumblebee. The rest of this franchise has been pretty poor, if not terrible, so I'll never be able to be completely excited for an upcoming addition. With that said, since I do like films in the franchise, I will always give it a shot. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts reignites some life into this franchise by taking a new direction and I'm at least curious if they take this route any further.

The overall premise is something we've seen many times before. Villains known as Terracons are on their way to Earth, where the Autobots have been taking refuge. With the addition of the Maximals, the Autobots make it their mission to save Earth from the looming threat of Unicron, who consumes whole planets to stay alive. This story is passable, but what made it far more enjoyable than I was expecting was the storyline involving Noah (Anthony Ramos). The human characters haven't been the strong suits of these films, but I'd say this might be the best one they've done yet.

Noah is struggling to find a job, while trying to support his brother (who has an illness) and wants to try and contribute financially to his mother as well. Falling back on robbing with a friend of his, he ends up stealing a transformer by the name of Mirage (voiced by Pete Davidson). Their bond ends up being pretty fun to watch and surprisingly the humour from Mirage isn't as eye-rolling as many of the humourous moments in the earlier films. It's the heart of the story that's created here that made me have a good time. There are moments of awesome action, but once again, portions of that are what made this film a little weaker for me.

The final 20 minutes of this film when it really starts involving Noah in the action is when it took off for me. I had a blast with what they do with his character and the twist was surprising and cool, even though it still worries me. The action did start to feel slightly bloated at times too, but that's due to the setting in my opinion. The last couple of Transformers films never took the time to set the action in an interesting area. There are another 30 minutes of this film that takes place in wreckage, but that's the only thing to be seen for miles. The locations are starting to make these films look less unique.

Overall I had a very fun time, but some of my issues from previous films are still present here. It's nice to see new directors entering this franchise, like the very talented Steven Caple Jr., I just wish they had more freedom. The Transformers aspect of the story here is bland, but the human story is probably the best they've done yet, so I'll give the film props for caring. Look, if you like any of the previous films, you'll likely enjoy this one as well. If you didn't, you probably won't. It's that simple when it comes to films like this.

124,124,7.0,"Jun 29, 2023","In the much-anticipated chapter ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,"" directed by Steven Caple Jr., there was an expectation for an injection of new life into the franchise of giant robots. What we got instead was an empty and uninspired repetition of the same old battles, confirming the criticisms directed at the previous films. The premise seemed promising: a setting in the 1990s, new characters, and the promise of a more intimate and engaging narrative. But the film gets lost in the franchise's clichés, failing to offer anything truly new or innovative. One of the most glaring issues is the lack of propulsive energy. Despite attempting to focus the action in a single room, the film lacks tension and a true sense of urgency. The action sequences, while spectacular, become repetitive and devoid of meaning, leaving audiences with a sense of apathy rather than excitement. Unfortunately, the human characters fail to lift the film from its mediocrity. The dialogues are embarrassing, and the plot is unconvincing. Despite the introduction of new faces, there is a lack of depth and interest necessary to truly make them shine on screen. Furthermore, the visual design of the robots themselves is disappointing. They lack originality and inspiration, resulting in personality-less and charmless creatures. Even the promises of Autobot innovation fall on deaf ears, with the film desperately clinging to the same old tricks instead of trying to evolve. ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a disappointing repetition without substance, lacking spark, originality, and anything that truly makes it worthy of the audience's attention.

125,125,10.0,"Jun 16, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is enjoyable while you watch it, but an honest review will less favorable than the in-the-moment movie experience. Perhaps the biggest compliment that carries the film's positive response is that it doesn't anger and annoy you like all the films minus the first one and Bumblebee.

The plot doesn't matter. Just explaining it can reveal plot holes in the setup. To simplify it, you have a mcguffin and it's fought over between different types of transformers and some humans tag a long to help. Every script has multiple parts that add up to how good it is. The dialogue is atrocious, but sometimes very naturally funny. The plot is paper thin and full of holes, but stands up enough to support the action. The action is great, highlights being a car chase on the streets of New York and the third act battle which has a dull brown setting that allows the colorful transformers to stand out and their action the center of attention. The editing is a bit of a slog, though, and makes it feel like several scenes could be trimmed.

Questions that I had during watching the movie: how did they know about the Porsche? What happened to the transformers at the end? Does no one know about the transformers?wouldn't their be a smarter way to hide, and recover, the mcguffin? And did they really think any deaths in the movie would be taken seriously?

126,126,6.0,"Jun 9, 2023","With new director Steven Caple Jr. In charge of the latest installment of the live-action Transformers films, this movie is yet another new take on what has since been needed after the Michael Bay-directed films and Travis Knight's spinoff prequel Bumblebee. Following off his success with Creed II, Caple Jr. Proved he can take on an action-adventure film with Anthony Ramos taking over as new lead character Noah Diaz left behind in the likes of Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky and Hailee Steinfeld's Charlie Watson.

Like 2018's Bumblebee which took place in 1987 Los Angeles, Rise of the Beasts serves as yet another prequel film now set in 1994 New York City during a time when several Autobots were already making themselves at home on Earth. At the same time, their allies known as the Maximals - who have been underground for years - come out of their hiding places when a threat catches theirs and the Autobots' attention.

With the return of voice acting great Peter Cullen as Autobot leader Optimus Prime, other additions to the voice cast like Ron Perlman as Optimus Primal, Peter Dinklage as the villainous Scourge, Michelle Yeoh as Airazor, and Pete Davidson as Mirage are an odd mix to be thrown into this universe. Anthony Ramos' character Noah who is ex-military, yet tech-savvy in his profession, proved to be quite the new addition in human characters. It's now his turn to be thrown into the conflict amongst alien robots. The locations featured in the movie are also quite an eyeful. The terrain of Peru's landscape is a wonderful view of where these Maximals reside.

Like the past installments before it, this movie has the typical displays of metal-clanging, alien robot fights with destruction left in their wake as we've seen as the highlights of the movies (with occasional humor), there's also a sense of humanity and a story that's not convoluted like the appalling Age of Extinction or The Last Knight. No. Instead, there's a story that you can easily comprehend without having to overthink it so much. Something not looked upon often. However, like Bumblebee, I say Rise of the Beasts is redemption for the film franchise. Like it teeters between the original 2007 film and Dark of the Moon.

129,129,7.0,"Jun 7, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a delightfully surprising return to the franchise's roots as a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. It's clean wholesome robot fun that offers two hours of solid escape.

As the 7th installment in the series, Rise of the Beasts is notably the first principal Transformers film not directed by Michael Bay, who only serves as a producer, and the difference shows.

Director Steven Caple Jr, who directed Creed II, takes a grounded yet light approach, ensuring the audience cares about the human characters, at least calculably enough to last through its runtime.

Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback are believable as normal working people that are accidentally caught in the middle of an alien space war. They both bring authenticity from playing it all straight and help sell the awe of seeing the robots.

Watching Michelle Yeoh's motorcycle jump onto a moving train in Police Story 3 as a kid, who would have thought she'd one day be the voice of a giant robot owl in a Transformers movie? She's crushing it from all sides. What a way to follow up on an Oscar win.

The action sequences are shot and edited clearly. Every move is easy to follow and one can blink if they need to. I was absorbed into the fights and many times was in awe of the sheer scale of the Transformers, fearing for the human characters and potential collateral damage.

The jokes are better written, more organic, and land better. There are no shrieking obnoxious characters forcibly jabbing the audience to laugh, trying to fill up a transitional moment.

Walking out of Rise of the Beasts, I reminisced about fun times playing with the Transformers toys as a kid, and not feeling dizzy, shouted at, or irked by inappropriate jokes.

131,131,6.0,"Feb 3, 2024","This was pure fun with tons of comedy - I can't recall laughing so much in a comedy film, let alone one that's not even listed as a comedy. Having Pete Davidson voice Mirage was brilliant and was literally the funniest character I've seen/heard in a long time.

When I first learned about all the new characters including the bots, I wasn't sure I'd like them, but every single one was excellent and added to the film. What I also liked was how there was more of a story - a great prequel, and less of the over-the-top Michael Bay mayhem of special effects. All S/VFX in this film were in perfect doses, very impressively done, and added to the story instead of detracting from it.

There was a great origin and current timeline story, superb character development, and thankfully, no cliched romance subplot. You will have a smile throughout this entire film, in between laughs and moments of awe during the impressive and stunning visual effects. This is what a Transformers movie should be - a tight narrative, clean action sequences and with tons of heart, whether human or bot.

132,132,1.0,"Jul 2, 2023","Overall I laughed and had an enjoyable time, no I don't think the movie was amazing but it was a decent watch.

I think Transformers has been extremely hit or miss since the first one and this one is okay.

The story is about Noah Diaz as he must find a key to help the autobots get home, meanwhile a planet sized transformer called Omnicron is out to destroy all worlds as they feed him.

The movie has some decent action scenes, Noah and Elena are good in this their chemistry is enjoyable and Pete Davison as Merage is a good autobot, he is the comedic relief which is non stop, it can get a bit much at times but there are some funny one liners.

I feel for the serious tone they went for was undermined a bit at times with all the jokes, the new design is good, I do prefer the bay look to most transformers but I prefer this bee.

The CGI is okay overall, some not good moments which take me out a bit of the movie. The score was good, one thing that bothers me is that their blasters chose when they inflict damage as sometimes they do nothing while others is it's a devastating blow.

134,134,7.0,"Jun 10, 2023","""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a delightful surprise in the cinematic landscape, proving itself as a commendable addition to the Transformers franchise. This newest iteration offers a summer blockbuster experience that is, frankly, a whole lot more fun and engaging than most of its predecessors.

The film stands out in terms of animation, pushing the envelope to deliver top-notch graphics that truly make the experience worth a theater viewing. Each Transformer species is immaculately designed, unlike some of the older films in the franchise that offered a visually muddled array of mechanical CGI. ""Rise of the Beasts"" successfully showcases each Transformer in their unique glory, creating a visual spectacle that's awe-inspiring and genuinely exciting.

In a departure from previous entries in the franchise, the film also manages to strike an appealing balance between its human and mechanical protagonists. This facet of the story felt carefully calibrated and is a breath of fresh air not seen since the original Transformers movie and the Hailee Steinfeld-led ""Bumblebee"".

The performances in ""Rise of the Beasts"" are another strong suit, with Pete Davidson as Mirage proving to be a highlight. Davidson's portrayal is both hysterical and emotionally poignant, deftly providing the film with its comedic and emotional beats. Equally compelling is Anthony Ramos, whose magnetic performance demonstrates why he's quickly becoming one of Hollywood's most promising rising stars.

However, ""Rise of the Beasts"" isn't a flawless masterpiece. Its story, while solid and engaging, can feel a tad predictable and doesn't quite break new ground within the genre. Still, this doesn't detract from the film's overall appeal. It's a visually stunning, character-driven summer blockbuster that delivers thrills, laughs, and a healthy dose of giant robot action.

Fair warning to the uninitiated: this movie might not be for everyone. If you're not a fan of large-scale, slightly mindless, sci-fi action spectacles, ""Rise of the Beasts"" might not be your cup of tea. However, for those who appreciate this genre, much like myself, this film promises a rollicking good time that will have you eagerly awaiting the next instalment.

In summary, ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a visually arresting, character-driven summer blockbuster that overcomes its narrative shortcomings to offer an entertaining and refreshing chapter in the Transformers saga. It's well worth your time and the price of a theater ticket. Here's to hoping the franchise continues on this upward trajectory.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",transformers rise of the beasts is a delightful surprise in the cinematic landscape proving itself as a commendable addition to the transformers franchise this newest iteration offers a summer blockbuster experience that is frankly a whole lot more fun and engaging than most of its predecessors the film stands out in terms of animation pushing the envelope to deliver topnotch graphics that truly make the experience worth a theater viewing each transformer species is immaculately designed unlike some of the older films in the franchise that offered a visually muddled array of mechanical cgi rise of the beasts successfully showcases each transformer in their unique glory creating a visual spectacle thats aweinspiring and genuinely exciting in a departure from previous entries in the franchise the film also manages to strike an appealing balance between its human and mechanical protagonists this facet of the story felt carefully calibrated and is a breath of fresh air not seen since the original transformers movie and the hailee steinfeldled bumblebee the performances in rise of the beasts are another strong suit with pete davidson as mirage proving to be a highlight davidsons portrayal is both hysterical and emotionally poignant deftly providing the film with its comedic and emotional beats equally compelling is anthony ramos whose magnetic performance demonstrates why hes quickly becoming one of hollywoods most promising rising stars however rise of the beasts isnt a flawless masterpiece its story while solid and engaging can feel a tad predictable and doesnt quite break new ground within the genre still this doesnt detract from the films overall appeal its a visually stunning characterdriven summer blockbuster that delivers thrills laughs and a healthy dose of giant robot action fair warning to the uninitiated this movie might not be for everyone if youre not a fan of largescale slightly mindless scifi action spectacles rise of the beasts might not be your cup of tea however for those who appreciate this genre much like myself this film promises a rollicking good time that will have you eagerly awaiting the next instalment in summary transformers rise of the beasts is a visually arresting characterdriven summer blockbuster that overcomes its narrative shortcomings to offer an entertaining and refreshing chapter in the transformers saga its well worth your time and the price of a theater ticket heres to hoping the franchise continues on this upward trajectory,POSITIVE

ROTB spends a lot of time in Brooklyn baby! With its human characters and tends to drag on about the struggles of main character Noah, introducing his ill younger brother and shady neighbourhood buddy. Enter the museum intern who happens upon an artefact which gives us a map to find this key thing.

We get to see some stunning robot action sequences as well, which is probably the closest feeling you'll get to the original 1986 animated movie. The Transformers, Maximals and bad guys all look amazing. The voice work is both personable and commanding, and well-executed by all involved. Pete Davidson shines as Mirage. Peter Cullen is Optimus. We see Optimus in a way we're not used to, and it's oddly refreshing although I missed his overt leadership and kick-assery.

While there's a whole lot of conveniences that push the story along, there appears to be at least some effort in making the characters realistic enough to not render them absolute morons or overly powered/awesome.

From the CGI of the transformers, action and explosions, and the good acting made it a good watch. Director Michael Bay is at it with his movies making sure they are filled with explosions. There is only so much you can do with explosions in movies especially CGI ones that can make it good. I felt that too many explosions can hold a movie back because it can be overloaded by them. However, the dialogue was captivating, but not groundbreaking as we learned more about the main protagonists Noah (Anthony Ramos) and Elena (Dominique Fishback) exchanging words with the autobots and maximals. It was fresh to see the Maximals in action as they are primal jungle autobots. My personal favorite maximal is Optiumus Primal because he is the brave leader of the maximals and he is a gorilla. Plus, I liked the 90's throwback music as well. Overall, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is good with its action, acting, and entertainment.

The object in question was last seen in the film's prologue as the planet eating Unicron (first introduced in the Transformers animated film from 1986) attacks the homeworld of the Maximals (transformers that can change into animals...duh!) seeking the Transwarp Key which can enable it to travel through time & space. Using it, a quartet of our heroes zap themselves to Earth & go into hiding. Meanwhile Ramos hoping to make a quick buck tries to boost a Porsche from a garage where he finds one of the Autobots instead who recruit him to travel to the museum where Fishback's handling of the Key has prompted it to emit a signal. The bad guys, the Decepticons, led by Scourge (also intro'd in the animated film), have also heard the signal & make their way to the site which has both sides engage in battle only to lose the Key but there's a second piece which resides in South America so Optimus Prime & his minions along w/their two new human recruits head down there & encounter the Maximals who fall into their cause as the fate of Cybertron, Unicron's next target, could be in jeopardy.

145,145,1.0,"Sep 18, 2023","Despite Caple's ability to create something that flows and is intermittently ""fun"", everything about Rise of the Beasts feels brief, hurried, and undernourished. There are plenty of fresh faces but the screenplay's limited opportunities don't allow you to get to know them properly, with the slight exception of Mirage and Noah, who stand out, by a margin, as the most engaging of the bunch. Aside from them, large swaths of the characters are either given the minimalist treatment, making brief appearances with one-liners or spew exposition like it's a Saturday school lesson that no student wants to be at.

If you're a Beast Wars fan, then you'll be dissapointed because the Maximals are nearly nonexistent, rocking up about more than half way through the movie. The Terrorcons, moreover, feel like cheap and inefficient versions of the Decepticons. But, particularly, Rise of the Beasts is incredibly predictable and contains reused components from earlier films, disabling its ability to exude much uniqueness. As a result, practically everything in the film feels like it's been done before, and it has.

Much of the film is recycled, from dialogue and character arcs to bits of rehashed music and narrative elements. By forcing itself to reuse elements from Michael Bay's films, Rise of the Beasts has its head stuck in the past and its eyes set on the future. It's unable to do Bay's action or Bumblebee's heart well enough to even qualify as a half-effort, hence it stands out like a car without much of a character.

146,146,7.0,"Jul 26, 2023","Transformers: Rise of The Beasts is a new movie from the Transformers franchise, first time I ever watch Transformers, so I was curious about this. From my personal experience I think this was an entertaining family-action movie, that was action-packed, funny and cool new overview of the Transformers characters. We are also introduced to some human characters, that spice up the story a little. I think that it would be a perfect movie, especially for a fourth grader. The plot is holding on, but the story is getting too long in the end, and could be shorter. This Transformers was very weird in some aspects. It was like mixing Indiana Jones, Lord of The Rings and Robots at the same time and somehow made it together to this.

The action scenes were entertaining, nice robot fun. The visual effects were nothing new, but for a movie like that it is average for what they are making. The friendship connection between the humans and the robots was showed very emotionally, for such a movie. I could feel how they felt, and they did a good job with that. As I mentioned, it could be shorter, I'm talking about ten minutes. Not a big deal, but something I can argue a little. The story is nothing new, but you know, stories are getting repetitive, so they could make something different. Something that I could be more surprised or impressed over in some way.

150,150,2.0,"Jan 9, 2024","The attention to detail and detail is sorely lacking in the new Transformers movie, Rise of the Beasts. It follows in the footsteps of Bumblebee, which improved upon Michael Bay's previous films in the franchise but also took a step back in some ways. Travis Knight's return to stop-motion animation is a loss for the franchise, as his expertise is better suited for other projects. The launch of the Hasbro Cinematic Universe doesn't bode well for the future.

The script written by Joby Herold and four other eminent writers is full of logical gaps and lacks fresh ideas. The introduction of the Maximals, the animal-like hairy and winged Transformers of Earth, is a questionable choice. Ron Perlman voices Optimus Primal, a gorilla-sized Maximal, and Michelle Yeoh voices Errazor, a peregrine falcon Maximal. As expected, Tongyi Chirisa plays Cheetor. The opening act is mind-boggling, with the Maximals battling Peter Dinklage's Scourge and his army of Terrorcons. They escape to Earth with a transwarp key, which is split in two and hidden across the planet.

The film improves slightly when Anthony Ramos' character, Noah Diaz, and his human entourage enter the scene. Despite the paper-thin characterization, Ramos brings potential to his role. Noah is good at electronics and is a military reject whose reason for dismissal is loosely defined. He is caring for his younger brother, Chris, who has a vaguely stated chronic illness. Dominique Fishbach plays Elana, a museum researcher with inconsistent abilities and a limited character arc.

Rise of the Beasts fails to create a sense of danger, and the action lacks risk. Characters rarely stay dead, which reduces audience engagement. The film also lacks visual distinctiveness, with cinematographer Enrique Chediac failing to capture the majesty of places like Peru's Aztec Empire. The final battle feels weightless and borrows heavily from Avengers: Infinity War, without reaching its exhilarating heights.

Despite its flaws, the film provides unadulterated entertainment and some genuinely funny moments. It's not as soulless as the Bay-directed previous films and has amusing references, including a joke about former franchise star Mark Wahlberg. Although it's hard to believe in the future of a series based on this movie, it can be enjoyed with popcorn.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",the attention to detail and detail is sorely lacking in the new transformers movie rise of the beasts it follows in the footsteps of bumblebee which improved upon michael bays previous films in the franchise but also took a step back in some ways travis knights return to stopmotion animation is a loss for the franchise as his expertise is better suited for other projects the launch of the hasbro cinematic universe doesnt bode well for the future the script written by joby herold and four other eminent writers is full of logical gaps and lacks fresh ideas the introduction of the maximals the animallike hairy and winged transformers of earth is a questionable choice ron perlman voices optimus primal a gorillasized maximal and michelle yeoh voices errazor a peregrine falcon maximal as expected tongyi chirisa plays cheetor the opening act is mindboggling with the maximals battling peter dinklages scourge and his army of terrorcons they escape to earth with a transwarp key which is split in two and hidden across the planet the film improves slightly when anthony ramos character noah diaz and his human entourage enter the scene despite the paperthin characterization ramos brings potential to his role noah is good at electronics and is a military reject whose reason for dismissal is loosely defined he is caring for his younger brother chris who has a vaguely stated chronic illness dominique fishbach plays elana a museum researcher with inconsistent abilities and a limited character arc rise of the beasts fails to create a sense of danger and the action lacks risk characters rarely stay dead which reduces audience engagement the film also lacks visual distinctiveness with cinematographer enrique chediac failing to capture the majesty of places like perus aztec empire the final battle feels weightless and borrows heavily from avengers infinity war without reaching its exhilarating heights despite its flaws the film provides unadulterated entertainment and some genuinely funny moments its not as soulless as the baydirected previous films and has amusing references including a joke about former franchise star mark wahlberg although its hard to believe in the future of a series based on this movie it can be enjoyed with popcorn,NEGATIVE

157,157,7.0,"Jun 10, 2023","The main development in the newest Transformers film is that the Maximals make their cinematic debut in this seventh edition. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, a de facto sequel to 2018's Bumblebee, features enough rock 'em, sock 'em robot action to thrill the devoted while showcasing appealing performances by Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback as the token humans present. Whether or not that information means anything to you will determine if you're the target audience for the film.

The plot starts in New York City in 1994, giving the soundtrack plenty of opportunities to include timeless hip-hop songs from the 1990s to go along with Jongnic ""JB"" Bontemps' booming score. Noah is introduced to the audience. He is a former Army private and tech expert who is currently trying to support himself and his friends by installing unauthorized cable boxes. Noah is in severe need of money to help support his hardworking mother and to cover the high cost of his dedicated young brother's sickle cell anemia-related medical demands.

Elena is the other main human character beside Noah. She is a gifted researcher who works at an Ellis Island archaeological museum and is tasked with tracing the history of a recently unearthed ancient artifact that resembles the Maltese Falcon. When her late-night investigation of the sculpture nearly destroys it and reveals a mysterious thing inside, she receives more than she bargained for.

In the meantime, Noah ends up hiding in a Porsche 911 after a failed attempt at minor criminality. It quickly becomes clear that Mirage is an Autobot who is hiding out in the city with his fellow Transformers, including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Arcee.

It turns out that the object Elena found is an extraterrestrial beacon that can summon the terrifying, planet-sized Terrorcon Unicron, who is out to destroy both the Autobots' home world and Earth. It goes without saying that everything culminates in a massive amount of violent mayhem when the Autobots join forces with the Maximals to beat the Terrorcons, who are commanded in battle by the extremely irritable Scourge. Along with the Autobots to help preserve the Earth, Noah and Elena become involved in the war as well.

The beautiful historic city of Cusco and the ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru, which haven't received this type of attention since, well, pretty much everyone's dating site profile, both contribute significantly to the success of the film. New York City (with Montreal substituting for it) also plays a significant role in the film.

With this big production constituting a significant shift from the smaller-scale movies he's previously directed, director Steven Caple Jr. Rises to the plate beautifully. The several action scenes, including a vehicle pursuit over the Williamsburg Bridge that is presumably still clogging up downtown traffic, are brilliantly planned and carried out.

Although the five screenwriters make an effort to infuse the proceedings with real human emotion, the plot itself turns out to be less engaging. Despite feeling like a 1930s melodrama subplot, the friendship that is developing between Noah and Elena-fueled by their common Brooklyn roots and desire to save the world without perishing in the process-proves to be surprisingly endearing.

159,159,7.0,"Apr 15, 2024","A whopping 16 years have passed since the first installment of Transformers came to us under the direction of Michael Bay. With 5 films in tow throughout all this time, the saga seems to find the right course to get out of the diversion that seemed to have with its third installment and that they cunningly manage to direct with the wonderful Bumblebee of 2018.

In this sixth installment and direct sequel to Bumblebee, we once again feel that we are on the right track to enjoy the saga, the truth is that they once again deliver us a fun movie to enjoy our popcorn and stay glued to the screen watching the forceful direction by Steven Caple Jr. Its director offers us a quite entertaining film from beginning to end where its 127 minutes fly by since the film begins quite high and later continues adding pauses that allow you to rest and then resume without this film slowing down. Make you eternal: visually we are left with a film that really stands out especially in its final sequence where it shows that action can be done under CGI without getting dizzy trying to understand it. The design of the characters of the Autobots as well as the Maximals are precious that are mixed with their interesting proposal in personalities such as how sensational Mirage turns out to be, where we can also include the moments that are lent to Bumblebee. The participation of the Maximals also falls like a glove to the saga and allows us to enjoy great moments with them, especially when they undergo their transformation.

For their part, the villains of the show intimidate and generate that desired antagonist for a film that seeks spectacularity above all else.

A saga that seems to really find the new way to give us pure entertainment, still has things to polish, but leaves the feeling that entertainment is guaranteed and that is already a good point in favor.

It seems that the saga took a quite unexpected turn, but that leaves pleasant sensations where they want to take everything, as revealed in its final scene.

A blockbuster of those necessary to forget about problems and just entertain ourselves, different viewers and critics may like it more or less, but no one can deny that there is entertainment in what we see and a good use of the budget in its favor.

If CGI quality is what matters most to you the animation will impress. The Beast models were outstanding.

The Bad: The story is heavily bound by DEI tropes and messaging, and everything from the scene to scene character interactions, backstories, subplots, language, mannerisms, soundtrack, cast, locations and flow of the movie is centered around it. It's very obvious, there's no need for subtlety when the brow beating is the whole point.

The Ugly: The female lead could not act, delivered no chemistry or sex appeal and simply could not pull it off. At all. If you're going the make the focal development of a blossoming romance take center stage in your story to draw the audience in... then make it a point select someone whose looks and acting range fits the part. It was like watching two incompatible people on the longest, wackiest and most awkward first date in the history of history.

163,163,1.0,"Apr 21, 2024","Well, let me be frank here - the last couple transformer-films were not up to the mark; hence I find the generic public disappointment towards the franchise to be logical. In fact, I was disappointed myself, and was skeptical whether I should take the trouble of going to the theatre for this or not. Despite not having the enthusiasm to go, I ended up going and had a good time.

The storyline is alright - not the best I'd say, but just alright for you to enjoy. It felt a bit rushed at some points, but not something too noticeable. The lead actors were new, and they did a good job. But if you ask for my opinion - I'd argue that it'd be more charming to see someone a bit more heavyweight - as that's the way how Transformer-films have always been. As for our GIANT SPACE ROBOTS - some of their characters should've been more well-written. So, there were multiple factors that needed improvement.

165,165,6.0,"Nov 11, 2023","This movie was not too bad. I enjoyed it. It was good to see Optimus Prime in his Freightliner alternate mode with some minor additions to his cab. The addition of the Beast Wars was a good touch though I would have preferred that to be a separate story later in the future. I loved the multi-ethnic cast. I am especially happy that a Hispanic actor was included as the main character. There are many new elements added including an explicit reference to Indiana Jones. Other elements are familiar to those who saw the 1986 Transformers: The Movie.

The weakest element was Unicron. I did not sense the fear that came when he approached Earth. Unicron was supposed to be a threat to the planet Cybertron in the cartoons and comic books. One thing that bugs me is the fact the no reference was made to the Matrix of Leadership which originally was the only thing that threatened Unicron.

171,171,7.0,"Jun 15, 2023","Ohkaeyyy .... Finally watched Rise of the Beats 😌 and I'll say it refreshes our beloved Transformers memories, especially Bay-verse action levels, not that high but it suits perfectly 👌. Also, the cinematography of this movie was really cool.

The best parts of this movie are Mirage-Noah chemistry and the Climax battle, that climax really reminds us about epic TF battles. And and, Bee's badass entry... No matter what Bee is still everyone's hero 😅. Also, the cinematography in Machu-Picchu Place goes to the next level, looking at robots in the beauty of nature is so cool and relaxing. I love it.

Those spider-bot scenes at rainy night and the underground place were actually horrorful 😳, I actually got scared at that scene. Also, that Airazor last scene in mountain 😥. This tells me that there's the possibility of exploring the TF universe through different genres, also. Just imagine a horror movie with robots 😱.

Thank god, this movie is really good 😌, I mean there are some issues like why put so many things in this one movie, the story moves so fast that it's sometimes hard to catch up with what exactly happened and honestly saying this is not our Optimus Prime 😨. This personality change with Optimum was a serious issue I guess, I mean he is calm, thinks before taking any action and he is wise because he is Prime, that's the reason why he became prime. And this is not about the rise of beasts, beasts barely have lead roles in this. And one last thing, why badass Scourge became so weak in the end if you look at the Scourge's introduction and first fight scene on earth, that's actually badass but don't know why it was tone down in the climax.

Well, these issues can be ignored if you look at cinematography and action choreography 👌. And this movie focuses deeply on building emotions, unlike Bay-verse tf movies. If you'll remember one thing from this movie, then it will be Mirage and Noah's chemistry, this has really good robot-human chemistry, after the Bumblebee (2019) movie.

Too simple a 90s premise but works most of the time in this film . Interestingly director Michael Bay is absent in this one and another picks up his earlier vintage style where Bay left off .

Not a bad venture for a prequel considering that I was not satisfied with the sequels that came after the first movie . The action and story flow is congruent with each other without the needless comedy antics of Shia LaBeouf. Instead we treated to some good 90s style corny dialogues and characterisation which doesn't feel out of place.

178,178,7.0,"Aug 5, 2023","Transformers, as always, is a very beautiful movie... visually. With a lot of fighting and explosions. I imagine how beautiful it must be to watch this in 3D (unfortunately I watched in 2D). Honestly, I went to watch this movie precisely because of that, because I tried to watch the first ones again to try to understand the story since it's been years since I watched it, but I stopped at the second one (but I still want to watch the Bumblebee solo movie).

In this one they managed to bring a little more story (more than the second at least). It has basically the same formula from previous films (Mirage's relationship with the protagonist, for example), but it didn't bother me. I believe that the producers knew how to work well with what the public expects and likes from this movie, as well as how to work a little bit on nostalgia (from beginning to end).

180,180,10.0,"Nov 20, 2023","I was curious to see where they were taking this after watching Bumblebee.

Whether you've seen this franchise previously or not, it's more of a reboot that hints at a connection to a different movie series. If you watched it as a child, like I did, it does bring up memories.

There are some action scenes in the movie, and they are entertaining.

Excellent VFX; for the most part, the robots and their transformation don't feel cartoonish.

Voice-over is flawless.

Following the ""Autobots,"" we get to meet the ""Maximals,"" ""Terrorcons,"" and a villain named ""Unicrons."" appreciated the action, especially the last fight. It also had emotional moments to break up the fast-paced action and allow you to take everything on screen in.

Although ""Optimus Prime"" is usually the primary character, ""Mirage"" steals the show in this instance.

The humour is inconsistent.

The director gave several new characters enough time to develop, which helped in the film's latter half to give any moment emotional weight.

The story is the one thing I dislike; it has the same unoriginal plot. It could have used a subplot to provide depth and interest. ""Rise of the beast"" is a movie, but we don't learn a lot about actual beasts ""Maximals"" in it.

Future stories with a crossover plot that is set up with a mid-credit sequence should hopefully be interesting.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",i was curious to see where they were taking this after watching bumblebee whether youve seen this franchise previously or not its more of a reboot that hints at a connection to a different movie series if you watched it as a child like i did it does bring up memories there are some action scenes in the movie and they are entertaining excellent vfx for the most part the robots and their transformation dont feel cartoonish voiceover is flawless following the autobots we get to meet the maximals terrorcons and a villain named unicrons appreciated the action especially the last fight it also had emotional moments to break up the fastpaced action and allow you to take everything on screen in although optimus prime is usually the primary character mirage steals the show in this instance the humour is inconsistent the director gave several new characters enough time to develop which helped in the films latter half to give any moment emotional weight the story is the one thing i dislike it has the same unoriginal plot it could have used a subplot to provide depth and interest rise of the beast is a movie but we dont learn a lot about actual beasts maximals in it future stories with a crossover plot that is set up with a midcredit sequence should hopefully be interesting,POSITIVE

Then 2nd movie is produced & 3rd one & so forth been made, I see the repetitive plot line is quite obvious.

Still, not to bash too much abt this movie, I did shed a tear during some emotional scene which I guess it's some kind of acceptance that not all this movie is bad, it just could be made better.

I also want to add up that It's quite refreshing this time around, no ""pretty"" ppl is shown simply bcoz to entice ppl to watch this movie. It's not necessary to begin with. The 2 human character works just fine.

192,192,7.0,"Sep 15, 2024","You know what - this is my favourite ""Transformers"" movie. Now that's not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with ""Optimus Primal"" (aka. ""Kingus Kongus"") having a fight with the all-consuming ""Unicron"" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker ""Noah"" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother ""Kris"" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. ""Noah"" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated ""Autobots"" who have realised that ""Elena"" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the ""Maximals"" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of ""Stargate"" as well ""King Kong"" (probably the Peter Jackson one), ""The Goblet of Fire""; ""Independence Day"", ""Star Trek"" (JJ Abrams version), all four ""Indiana Jones"" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle ""Airazor"" reminded me of a hairier version of ""Bubo"" from ""Clash of the Titans"". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times!

194,194,6.0,"Jun 11, 2023","Even with these subplots and the addition of many new characters, the film is the most down-to-earth of the entire franchise. Obviously, director Steven Caple Jr. Gets caught up in some of the franchise's conventions, such as robot animals and the need to make everything grand - the film, after all, is once again about a cosmic threat against Earth. However, he comes closer to Bumblebee when he puts emotion and development into the robots - who were once just cold machines. The story is more concerned with developing than creating spectacle. Furthermore, there is lightness: while the other films didn't give space for this, ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" manages to add functional humor (the robot Mirage has one of the most ingenious ideas in the franchise with a single line) and creates good characters.

Still talking about the Maximals, although the film never bothers to explain why they adopted the form of our planet's fauna, the production is effective in establishing their own identity for the characters. The new machines incorporate fur, feathers, claws and beaks into a flashy design - unlike the pile of twisted metal that the Transformers became in previous films. All these new features give ""Rise of the Beasts"" a freshness that the saga needed. Taking its cue from the Bumblebee solo film, which found the heart the saga had long lost, the new film increases the scope without losing sight of the excitement. Which brings us to another lesson learned from the solo production of the yellow Beetle: the human component enhances the story, if handled well.

It's no secret that humans have an ungrateful position in being left with the least interesting part of adventures whose focus is the fight between robots that transform into cars. But ""Rise of the Beasts"" strives for Earthlings to not only be the emotional anchor, but also actively participate in the journey, helping the robots to continue until the inevitable blows. The heroes of the day are presented with relatable problems that put the audience on their side almost instantly. A cue taken advantage of by Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback, whose charisma makes Noah and Elena great representatives of the public in the action. In a film so concerned with justifying the presence of humans at every step, the duo becomes a highlight by making the necessary bridge between earthly dramas and the apocalyptic robotic beating. This cast of representatives of the human, Autobot and Maximal races are forced to join forces on a journey that is exciting, but not surprising.

The script is expository and shamelessly didactic. It fails to please both those who enjoy the uninterrupted noise of twisted metal and those who prefer a plot that is, at the very least, convincing. Insecurity that results in superficiality on both sides. The rush to immediately jump to the action sequences affects the development of the characters, not allowing the viewer to become attached and interested in the shallowly constructed conflicts. The film falls into the same traps as its predecessors by filling the plot with clichés that steal any sense of surprise. There is an unthinkable ease in this development, something that takes away the verisimilitude of the narrative. The good guys and bad guys have the most advanced technology in the world, but they are unable to detect a key that is in a location visible to everyone. ""But I have the answer here"", the black oracle immediately responds, providing precise geographical indications through scribbles in a notebook. Robots are dead and seek to evoke great emotional appeal, until it is revealed that they have been restored, ready for the next adventure. An open portal would be a catastrophic and irreversible action, until it is closed quickly.

There is a rush to move on to the next action, to move on to the next joke or fight. Therefore, no imbroglio can last as long as necessary to justify its origins, its consequences, to leave traces or deep marks on the psychology of the characters. ""The key is here, in Peru"", says the voice pointing to a map. ""Let's go!"", the robots respond immediately. There is no duration, delay, effort. The journey is ignored as a process, both of understanding and learning. This is action in the purest and most unreflective sense of the term: you run from one country to another, from a plain to an archaeological site, from a garage to a museum. A new track is launched, and the participants of the crazy interplanetary scavenger hunt leave, excited.

At least in the action mentioned, whether in car races or fights, the production is a full dish for those looking for adrenaline. Especially thanks to the direction of Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II), who delivers the visual spectacle expected from a Transformers film. Showing great passion for the characters he has in hand; the filmmaker looks to the work of Steven Spielberg to revive the taste for adventure that the master of blockbusters awakened with his classics. The homages and direct quotes to classics such as ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Jurassic Park"" are not gratuitous and appear on the screen as the objective that the production seeks to achieve. Of course, there is no comparison with any of these classics - something that would harm not only ""Rise of the Beasts"", but the majority of blockbusters produced today. However, these influences set the tone of the production and bring a new flavor to the fights. The fights are exciting, flashy and provide the entertainment expected by those returning to the franchise. It doesn't revolutionize, but it entertains.

Caple Jr knows how to guide the camera to ensure we are involved in each of the sequences; however, he is aware that bringing originality to a plot of this genre is a difficult task and, therefore, he bets on a classic hero's journey that satisfies us from beginning to end. After all, Noah is ripped from the world in which he lives and goes through the most diverse obstacles until he learns the value of martyrdom and emerges as an ""avenger"" who protects those he loves and his allies; and, in a way, he bears unmistakable similarities to a melancholic Optimus who suffers for having failed and putting everyone in danger. Both dive into a mandatory maturation arc that values unity and joint strength, rather than defending the inhospitality of solitude. The director also borrows elements from Travis Knight in ""Bumblebee"" to find stability between content and spectacle: the result is solid enough to not let the film completely derail, embracing a cleaner aesthetic that allows each element to stand out. As a unit, not as sporadic fragments. This does not mean that there are no errors - after all, the absurd number of protagonists and supporting characters prevents some arcs from being deepened as they should, remaining in a sad superficiality that relies on unbridled nostalgia and the formulas of the genre. But, in the end, we left the room with a feeling of pure pleasure and that the film delivered exactly what it proposed - endless fun, from which it is impossible to take your eyes off.

However, it is strange that the film's real novelty - the introduction of the Maximals - is so poorly handled. It's clear that ""Rise of the Beasts"" is the first film in probably a new trilogy to use these characters, but that's no excuse for relegating them to a background almost just to fill space and screen time. After all, the preamble on their planet, with Scourge trying to obtain the key for his master who, with it, can satisfy his hunger for planets, as well as very direct mentions, by Optimus Primal (the gorilla), that they come from the future, imply that, in narrative terms, they should gain a more solid, better-crafted draft that would create a greater context for their presence on Earth. Although the final scene points to the future of the franchise, it doesn't even mention the animal robots, which leaves them completely open and unconstructed, nothing more than just other soldiers in the midst of the fight against Scourge. In other words, we have yet another example of a film in which the expansion of a franchise's mythology is more important than the story being told in the context and limits of the work, an irritating habit of some more recent Hollywood blockbusters that seem to think that audiences want to see the cinematic equivalent of a TV series and not self-contained films that are at the same time capable of serving as new pieces in a larger puzzle.

Between missed opportunities and necessary updates, ""Rise of the Beasts"" is more restrained and less spectacular, what the audience expects from live-action Transformers. It is a fact that this time the franchise did not deviate from its standard, which could alienate those who are no longer enchanted by battles between giant robots. However, for those with an appetite for action, there is enough news to make the return to the saga remarkable. After all, it's not often that you see a mechanical gorilla going on a rampage near a cultural heritage site. Only the ending seems like an eternal reminder of what Transformers has always been. It ends up going on too long, exaggerating the tone, and creating something that could alienate part of the audience that was enjoying the story. It's an excerpt that doesn't seem to come from the mind of Caple Jr., but from Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the producer who has always led the saga. A shame, but it doesn't ruin the experience - which is one of the main surprises at cinema in 2023.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",even with these subplots and the addition of many new characters the film is the most downtoearth of the entire franchise obviously director steven caple jr gets caught up in some of the franchises conventions such as robot animals and the need to make everything grand the film after all is once again about a cosmic threat against earth however he comes closer to bumblebee when he puts emotion and development into the robots who were once just cold machines the story is more concerned with developing than creating spectacle furthermore there is lightness while the other films didnt give space for this transformers rise of the beasts manages to add functional humor the robot mirage has one of the most ingenious ideas in the franchise with a single line and creates good characters still talking about the maximals although the film never bothers to explain why they adopted the form of our planets fauna the production is effective in establishing their own identity for the characters the new machines incorporate fur feathers claws and beaks into a flashy

196,196,6.0,"Oct 6, 2023","Loved the transformers, the storyline of what was taking place is pretty good. The action was good, I'm glad they kept with the normal visuals of the Bay films. That said, let me preface by saying I really enjoyed the other Transformers movies. I'm not a Michael Bay hater like many critics tend to be. I thoroughly enjoy his movies. I was a bit nervous with this not having him at the helm, but it holds up nicely.

My only complaint with this film is the lead female role. I mean, a talking, transforming robot is more believable to me than her acting. Maybe she's a great actress elsewhere, I'm not sure, but in this one, her acting just seemed flat and kind of boring. It felt like she wasn't sold on her character.

I thought Ramos was great. He was funny but also believable in the personal battles he was fighting.

The storyline presented a captivating and intriguing narrative. The seamless fusion of the animal and car transformer realms was nice, yeah, and the CGI and special effects surpassed my expectations - each fight was done greatly. However, the human characters, Ramos and Fishback, felt unnecessary, and their involvement in the action, dialogue, and plot felt forced and absolutely wasteful in terms of storyline. While both actors are talented, their performances in this context felt out of sync.

One more thing - the humor; it was nice, something actually funny but also felt pretty forced as if the writers were pushed into adding the comedic relief by force.

Despite having some moments of mild entertainment, this film falls short with too few scattered throughout.

I would have liked a lot more of Michelle Yeoh though. Peter Dinklage's villain was more likable than Optimus Prime, but that maybe says more about how great I think Dinklage is.

That is not the case with Rise Of The Beasts. Without giving away any spoilers, the movie gives a gradual (and competent) development of the story along with character development in both the humans and transformers.

The movie builds off of Bumblebee nicely by maintaining some of the innocence while incorporating much of the action and darkness that we see in the Michael Bay Transformers movies.

The soundtrack however was incredible, hearing some of the og Transformers songs was truly magnificent, the score composer truly nailed this soundtrack.

I watched transformers in the 80's and later Beast wars. I understand making a newer version brings change. No problem with that. The plot is as simple as in many of those cartoons, fair enough.

Like those before it, this film chooses to focus on humans as their main characters. I have no idea why that is. They never were in the cartoon/animated series. These are very basic characters with a generic story, supposed to make us care. It simply did not happen.

Reasons for the humans to do anything of use feel shoehorned in or just makes the film lose credibility.

205,205,3.0,"Jan 26, 2024","This film is exactly what I wanted back when I was in my Transformers phase we all went through as a kid. I remember being very bored and very disappointed watching the long Bay Transformers films, though of course it had its moments.

The Transformers in this film are a lot more emotive and have more character in them.

Optimus for one is a lot more of a flawed character in this, in a good way. He actually makes mistakes and he knows he made those mistakes. And it was very nice to see him have a mini character arc and slowly get back to being the optimistic, Optimus Prime that we all know and love.

The chemistry between Noah and Mirage was also surprisingly very entertaining to watch.

There were actually some very emotional scenes that actually do hit you. I can remember 2 scenes off the stop of my head that almost made me want to tear up. One including the Maximals and one including humans and Autobots.

The visuals was good, enough for you to not be distracted by it.

The action was fine, nothing too creative. But fights between the Transformers are still a lot better than anything we got in the Bay films. Best ones were the Mirage chase scene, Optimus vs Scourge's last battle and every Bumblebee fight.

The jokes do land, was worried Mirage was gonna be cringe but he was a nice addition to the live action films.

There are some corny dialogue but you kinda get used to it as some point, just gotta watch it in a child's perspective and you'll enjoy the dialogue much more.

207,207,1.0,"Sep 7, 2024","Rise of the Beasts opens with Noah who struggles to find a decent job to support his family and Elena who works in a museum and is interested in researching artifacts. But oh my, we couldn't care less about them. They really spent almost 30 minutes on their stories which as you can guess, are very bland and dull. Noah's story might seem relatable for some people as we're in a tough economy now but audience doesn't want you talking about finding a job. This ain't for the Oscar. And Elena barely has any story. We don't even know who she is. No really. Who is she? 😅😭


They could cut to the chase and skip some of the parts in the first act. It becomes worse when there's no comedy, everything is just so serious. A total opposite of Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and Mikaela's (Megan Fox) where comedy was top-notch and the plot was simple and fun. Even Sam's parents were comical. We're not exactly sure why they chose the serious road this time around, but we prefer Sam Witwicky's world.
















Verdict: Incredibly better than Transformers 4 & 5, Rise of the Beasts offers itself to be quite entertaining with above-average action sequences and some genuinely WOW moments, thanks to its choreography and tracking shots. However, the uninteresting human drama and lack of comedy make this a subpar entry compared to the first three Transformers films.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",rise of the beasts opens with noah who struggles to find a decent job to support his family and elena who works in a museum and is interested in researching artifacts but oh my we couldnt care less about them they really spent almost minutes on their stories which as you can guess are very bland and dull noahs story might seem relatable for some people as were in a tough economy now but audience doesnt want you talking about finding a job this aint for the oscar and elena barely has any story we dont even know who she is no really who is she they could cut to the chase and skip some of the parts in the first act it becomes worse when theres no comedy everything is just so serious a total opposite of sam witwicky shia labeouf and mikaelas megan fox where comedy was topnotch and the plot was simple and fun even sams parents were comical were not exactly sure why they chose the serious road this time around but we prefer sam witwickys world verdict incredibly better than transformers rise of the beasts offers itself to be quite entertaining with aboveaverage action sequences and some genuinely wow moments thanks to its choreography and tracking shots however the uninteresting human drama and lack of comedy make this a subpar entry compared to the first three transformers films,NEGATIVE

This latest addition franchise takes a new approach and has a different feel, tone and atmosphere which works.

The lead of Anthony Ramos does a solid job as he is a clear rising star and portrays a likeable and root-able character. The lead female in Dominique Fishback was rather forgettable and their chemistry wasn't special.

The action is solid and and the visuals are stunning as ever. There is more focus on the human characters opposed to the Transformers which may disappoint people. Several references to the previous films are also included.

Unlike the previous Transformers movies, the runtime here is relatively short (less than two hours excluding end credits- which is great as those Mark Wahlberg films in particular were overlong and dragged).

But seriously, this movie was FINE. Gah lee.

TLDR: good basic action flick, not particularly stunning script wise (predictable plot, basic dialogue), fun actions scenes, pretty darn good cgi, cool transformer designs, nice sfx.

For the parents and sensitive viewers: no sexual content at all (perhaps one or two silly jokes could be taken sexually), not much cursing (standard s-h-a-d sort of stuff), gore is all robot, tho some sudden car crashes in the beginning with humans

nitpicky section:

YES I also disliked the colored vs. White tensions the movie tried to emphasized. It was so one dimensional and kinda childish honestly. It had literally no affect in rest of the plot so it was honestly kinda just shoved in their for agenda's sake? Look I'm colored and I found those parts forced and stupid. If you are going to put some racial tensions, at least make it realistic and dimensional?? And maybe put more effort to weaving it into the plot more seemlessly?

Also this may be petty, but I found it awfully off putting by the graphic demises of a few cops and that one security guard. It was so sudden and so...unnecessary almost? Did they absolutely have to die?? Like what? They were some of the only humans to die onscreen so it was odd and disproportionate...? They are just doing their job, come on... idk maybe that's just me.

Sure the plot was basic but I honestly wasn't expecting a masterpiece lol. It was pretty lame but the action and cool animation made up for it.

Also maybe this is just me cuz I watched the previous movies a long time ago when I was younger, but gah lee I'm glad Bay didn't direct this one. His human characters and side plots absolutely sucked and I wanted all the humans to die (they were so fricking annoying). But this movie, the characters were alright. They were they own persons, they had their own motivations, and the family theme with Noah was kinda sweet. The girl lead was not sexualized (THANK GOD *glares at Bay*) AND THERE WAS NO ROMANCE AMAZINGLY??? It was refreshing. I'm sick of the useless and/or supposedly bada** gf trope.

ALSO THE ENDING......not the post credit ending BUT THE NORMAL ENDING.....the Easter egg thingy..... look, if you are a big of a fan of a certain other Hasbro franchise,,,, you'll love it (or maybe hate it?). I personally thought it was awesome cuz of the comic reference but hey that's just me.

One problem, I have seen with all the movies in this franchise is that they all have the same story; you got a villian who wants to destroy earth and with the help of humans you fight them.

I grew up on the Transformers Prime TV show. That is where I fell in love with the Autobots and Decepticons. I have followed their universe ever since, trying to recreate those childhood memories. War for Cybertron had its moments, Cyberverse was fun and Bayverse was... a unique experience. This movie was just.. bad. Others have said it better than I.

I only watched this movie because it was something that the brothers and dad could watch together without any grumbling. It ended up being fun. We laughed and ridiculed the movie together, making fun or complaining about the terrible dialogue, countless jump-the-shark moments, nonsensical scenes, and janky action sequences.

What hurt though is what these producers did to the characters and universe that I loved as a kid.

This movie feels like the director had a research team creat cliffnote outlines of the classics characters from the old shows and movies, slapped a new bunch of CGI paint on them, put them in an AI-generated plot, and said ""pay us money and watch the pretty pictures mindless apes""

If you love Transformers, go watch the shows I have mentioned or explore the comics like I have started to recently. Don't waste your time with this. You'll only feel sad.

233,233,1.0,"Jun 12, 2023","The movie isn't bad it just doesn't climax as hard the every other transformers movie. The action wasn't epic and there was no glorious speech from Optimus prime that'd make me wanna do 200 pushups and fight a hyena at 3am if I had to. It's Transformers... I wanted it to make the kid in me jump, I don't care for it to be sensible. Some good reviews are probably coming from people who watched beast wars and feel nostalgia.

This has fast and furious aura to it, were family is huge incentive and that's all I could think about. Cgi and other effects are good, action was a downgrade from previous movies but still decent. The new characters were amazing, both antagonist and protagonist. Great to see what made Optimus Prime, Optimus Prime. It's not as a big a backstory as advertised, more of a midlife crisis instead. I enjoyed the new actors from other works, like Dominique fishback from project power. Anthony Ramos too. I think they're reactions to scenarios they found themselves in were believable at the start, but the chemistry they supposed to have didn't feel justified, story arc's rushed. Soundtrack pretty good(based in the 90's), the cast and the characters were great, but the story and the action let them down and are what's most unimpressive about the movie.

The first third of the movie is great, it's what you'd expect and got me a little excited, then the rest of the movie is underwhelming. A bit slow paced, not as thrilling as it should've been. Still the same DNA as other transformer movies, were humans still somehow play a really important role in alien intergalactic warfare. I think this was the weakest attempt at trying to justify humanity deserving anything more than just a participation medal for combat.

It does seem like they were trying to bring something new at first. The first act provided a good backstory, the introductions were great and some underlying racial elements. I loved that it started out like a regular movie, not transformers. Story's a bit predictable but not annoyingly so, not unless you're actively trying to figure out what's next. The bad guys in transformers are always trying to teleport another planet to earth so a little repetitive. Also takes inspiration from a lot of other stories, most notably Galactus with Scourge as silver surfer role, or Steppenwolf and Darkseid, were the evil entity sends out henchmen first.

It is open to a sequel. The ending wasn't as grand, especially the huge speech we've come to associate with the franchise. As far as the timeline is concerned, Optimus still has time to perfect his speeches and bring back linkin park.

I think the movie was lacking that wow factor, admittedly haven't seen any of the previous movies recently but they were more memorable. This has nothing for you to truly remember it by, I thought it'd be unique with a new director putting a stamp on it, but it felt like the most generic addition to the franchise yet. I think it's the most comedic but not by much and that's not what I'd want to remember a transformers movie experience by. Watching Micheal bay's takes must have been absolutely astonishing in cinema, maybe hard to match/outdo the grandeur but at least try.

Maybe knowing bumblebee and other characters survive also removes a little pathos from it as well. Bumblebee was the original rocket, then again guardians of the galaxy came out after so maybe it's the other way round.

I think it's a decent movie, especially if you had watch-along of all the transformers movies chronologically, this isn't a bad addition but it's the most forgettable. I only found out about Rise of the Beasts just before it's premiere so there wasn't really a long time for my hype to build up for this. That's probably what stopped me from being too heavily disappointed.

235,235,1.0,"Jun 9, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is EVERYTHING a Transformers would want. Now, this movie isn't 5 stars, but from the perspective of a Transformers fan, it is. I see why fans of the animated show and comics were unhappy with the Michael Bay adaptions, because THIS feels like a Transformers movie. The dialogue and important plot points feel ripped out of a comic, which is good but sometimes bad. The story is one of the strongest we've gotten from one of these movies, but it still isn't the best. Very over reliant on Macguffins. Noah is an actually good and (decently) well-written protagonist and shows that the human characters in these movies aren't bad, instead, it's the way they're written. Elena is a VERY weak main character, and her mediocre acting doesn't help.

The acting sequences are some of the best we've ever gotten. The mountains of Peru were a genius idea, and they serve us some awesome set pieces. The CGI is *amazing* and puts so many recent movies to shame. The voice acting is really good too. Pete Davidson and Peter Dinklage are standouts. Speaking of Peter Dinklage, Scourge is an awesome villain, and I'd argue he's the best one we've gotten. Awesome voice acting and design, but is still menacing. All the Autobots are actual characters too and are likeable. The Maximals feel underutilized for the most part, but they steal the show when they're onscreen.

The climax is one of my favorites out of the series and might be the best. An amazing set-piece and the soundtrack is pretty good. I will say, the absence of Steve Jablonsky is felt. His talent could have made the best scenes in the movie even better. There are a lot of interesting plot points that I won't talk about due to spoilers, but I think this is the best Transformers movie we've gotten.

I absolutely hated the original Bayverse films due to a few reasons. 1) unlikeable humans swallowed up a large portion of runtime; 2) action scenes shot in such a way where the constant zoom-ins made it harder to appreciate the grandeur (and also, I'd lose track of placement as they were-at times-shot sloppy); 3) bots felt less like characters and more like hollow monsters that just fought and transformed.

In Rise of the Beasts, I could feel the love that was poured into the characters, and that includes the bots. It felt like a giant love letter for fans of the franchise down to the iconic lines thrown in, the character arcs for certain bots, and the action was fantastic. I also was deeply surprised by how endeared I was to the main human, and the parallels that were made between him and Optimus. The nods to other Transformers media (aka the Unicron Trilogy with the introduction of cyber keys) was also great.

The main human character is a real standout. Just like in Bumblebee, the casting choice here is a winner, injecting the film with a shot of credibility. There are about half a dozen moments of pure, unadulterated excitement sprinkled throughout the movie, almost enough to make you jump out of your seat!

The film lacks any coherent plot, leaving viewers perplexed and disengaged throughout its unbearable runtime. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners that would make even the most amateur screenwriter cringe. The special effects are laughably terrible, resembling something a high-school student would create on a shoestring budget.

The acting is atrocious, with wooden performances that make you wonder if the cast were reading off cue cards. The protagonist's lack of charisma makes it impossible to root for them, while the villain's motives are so poorly developed that you couldn't care less about their evil plan.

The editing is a disaster, with jarring cuts and continuity errors that make it feel like the film was hastily slapped together without any attention to detail. The score is equally forgettable, failing to evoke any emotion or complement the scenes in any meaningful way.

To add insult to injury, the movie's attempts at humor fall flat, resorting to juvenile and tasteless jokes that elicit eye-rolls rather than laughs. It's evident that the filmmakers relied on shock value and cheap gags, completely neglecting the essence of good storytelling.

The end of these films has become familiar and boring. There is no difference in the story, no matter how much the writer and director try to cover it by creating new characters or using different actors.

Unfortunately, this thing has become widespread in the world of the film industry. They cannot invent a new story, nor even play roles without affectation and exaggeration.

251,251,1.0,"Jun 8, 2024","""Rise of the Beasts"" is a surprisingly good film that I fairly enjoyed from start to end! It's almost completely different from the Michael Bay movies. This Transformers film actually has a focus on its story where the characters have an objective. Same goes with the writing given to our lead human character played by Anthony Ramos who is good in this film. The CGI and visual effects are really good. Almost no moment felt like the work was undone. Optimus Prime is back and his character was given a lot of depth. He actually has an arc, which I found so surprising. This is a good looking film with very light saturation unlike the Michael Bay ones. The action sequences are super entertaining and made the movie flow better with its direction and pacing. We come to these movies for its action with CGI autobots. This does lead me to one of my negatives. Whenever there isn't an action sequence, the pacing suffers and feels much slower then it was. Whenever there's an action set piece, the movie move as I mentioned earlier. Another negative I have with the film are some of its characters that have nothing to do in the film and are forgettable whenever they are on screen. I also found the structure of the story off the edge and that is to do with the movies' story inconsistencies. There are also some motivations that don't always make sense and scenes that didn't need to be in the film but it didn't hurt my overall experience.

257,257,6.0,"Oct 19, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the seventh installment in the Transformers film franchise, and it delivers what fans have come to expect from the series: spectacular action, stunning visuals, and nostalgic references to the classic toys and cartoons. The film is set in 1994, and follows the adventures of Optimus Prime and his Autobots as they face a new threat from the Predacons, a faction of ancient Transformers that can transform into prehistoric beasts. Along the way, they team up with a pair of human allies, played by Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback, who help them uncover the secrets of their origins and destiny.

The film is directed by Steven Caple Jr., who brings a fresh and energetic vision to the franchise, while staying true to its core elements. The action scenes are thrilling and inventive, showcasing the diverse abilities and personalities of the Transformers, as well as their interactions with their human counterparts. The film also pays homage to the original Generation 1 Transformers.

The film also explores the mythology and history of the Transformers, revealing more about their origins on Cybertron, their connection to Earth, and their role in the cosmic balance.

The film is not without its flaws, however. The plot is sometimes convoluted and confusing, with too many subplots and twists that are not fully explained or resolved. The dialogue is often cheesy and clichéd, relying on humor that falls flat or feels forced. The human characters are not very well-developed or relatable, serving mostly as plot devices or comic relief. The film also suffers from some pacing issues, being too long and slow in some parts, and too rushed and abrupt in others.

However, these flaws do not detract from the overall enjoyment of the film, which is ultimately a fun and entertaining ride for fans of the Transformers franchise. The film is a visual feast for the eyes, with stunning CGI effects that bring the Transformers to life in realistic and detailed ways. The film is also a nostalgic trip for those who grew up with the Transformers toys and cartoons, offering plenty of Easter eggs and references that will make them smile. The film is a celebration of the Transformers legacy, as well as a promising start for a new chapter in their saga.

261,261,6.0,"Jun 11, 2023","The robots in disguise are back, although I'm not certain if we've ""truly"" seen these versions before. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a new start, of sorts. I'm assuming it takes place in the same continuity as 2018's Bumblebee, as opposed to that of Michael Bay's series -- not that those films had any kind of real, coherent continuity to begin with.

Certain fanboys have gone bananas for the film, ecstatic that it resembles the old 'toons more than it resembles the prior live-action films, but even as I try to enter the mind of a fanboy, it's hard to see what's so exciting about this dull, predictable affair. Some praised the one-take battle in one particular clip, comparing it to the shakiness, incomprehensible editing, and senseless framing of the ones in the Bay films (especially The Last Knight).

In doing so, however, they only drew attention to how bland and soulless everything looks now (not just Rise of the Beasts; that one car-chase promo for Indiana Jones 5, posted around the same time, gave us a similar epiphany). They made us miss Bay. To quote Brandon Streussnig: ""I understand Bay isn't for everyone ... but the way we've overcorrected into soulless, stitched-together one-takes where everything moves robotically (sorry) is boring. This kind of shot is in every blockbuster now and they all look the same.""

I don't know that this makes it worse than The Last Knight (very few movies are), but you can't say Bay isn't a distinct filmmaker. His compositions and color schemes are unmistakably his. His action scenes, although they failed to make these robots seem like they were actually there (they were well-rendered but never felt truly immense or heavy), had some real ""oomph"" to their gun blasts and explosions. This was in no small part due to the fact that, despite what jokes we might make about Bay's inveterate love of CGI, he did favor practical pyrotechnics, cars, and sets. (Rewatch The Rock sometime if you doubt me.)

Also, some other fans don't take kindly to the way these more cartoon-accurate designs look in live-action. (Like Bay's versions, they don't always seem to have any real presence, and without all the fire and smoke -- as well as the aforementioned shakycam -- it is easier to notice imperfections in the CGI.) So do the piles of whirring and clanking spiky garbage from the older live-action films work better? In retrospect, maybe some do. But I can't say miss watching them partake in indecipherable action scenes. Plus, none of the new robots are unnerving stereotypes, scenes/shots actually follow semi-logically from one to the next, and there aren't entire sequences devoted to explaining why dating a minor in Texas is okay, so that's nice.

All the same, I would agree that this movie feels more ""corporate""; rarely is there a sense that anyone's particular vision or voice is being expressed. But who cares? Look, it's Optimus Prime, and he's voiced again by Peter Cullen! And Optimus Primal from Beast Wars is there too, voiced by Ron Perlman! Remember Beast Wars? Oh no, Unicron is coming! Remember Unicron? Look, it's Pete Davidson as... Wait, where are you going?

In the movie, the Maximals (those are the 'bots that mimic wild animals) are the first to come under attack from Unicron (naturally, they have Something He Wants), fleeing to Earth to seek the aid of Optimus and the Autobots. Of course there must be attractive humans along for the MacGuffin hunt. They're okay, but nothing especially original; the most interesting arcs belong to the robots -- who, yes, seem like proper characters this time around.

There are some smaller-scale VFX moments that work well enough, and the 90s setting is fairly well-realized, with an appropriate number of Wu-Tang Clan and A Tribe Called Quest tracks. (I also noticed the movie Spaceballs among the assorted audio clips Bumblebee uses to communicate, which made me smile.) That's a bonus for the adults. What of the kids? Well, supposing the Spider-Verse screening is sold out, they might enjoy the action here too. For the kids-at-heart, there's the prospect that this franchise has gone full MCU and that there's apparently a full-on ""Hasbro cinematic universe"" in the works. Note that Hasbro also owns My Little Pony.

So as a life long fan of Transformers I finally watched this poor excuse for a movie due to boredom. I say finally as I really enjoyed the first few movies in the series, dark side of the moon is especially great in 3D! But then the franchise seemed to get stale and old. Age of extinction started to show it had run out of fuel when the reboot didn't exactly get me excited, it started to feel at that point if you've seen one of them you've seen them all. The last knight just proved this further, even attaching Mr Hopkins to the cast couldn't save it. So as I say I was bored and it was free so I thought let's give it a go and see how bad it is. Wow, it's BAD! Both lead human characters act SO over the top you'll think at times you're watching a spoof movie. The girl is especially bad and cringe. The dreadful script doesn't give them much to work with so that maybe why they felt to overact even the smallest things! The humour is pretty lowbrow obvious unfunny rubbish. We've got girl transformers now, all ethnics boxes ticked also. Then it hit me, this was made in 2023 now I understand. It seems more and more these days that studios are more concerned with ticking what they consider appropriate boxes rather than making a good movie. Like some films focus everything on cgi instead of story, nowadays it's like all the focus is on diversity instead of ANYTHING else. I don't care who a film has in it, their gender or their race!!! I just want good entertainment!!! Is that so much to ask for these days??! Apparently so. Anyway I'm done now, in a nutshell this movie is exactly what's wrong with movies today. It's just for people who are happy to spend 2 and a half hours watching explosions and pretty cgi with ZERO substance or intelligence.

278,278,6.0,"Aug 30, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts strikes a perfect balance between action-packed sequences and heartfelt moments. The action scenes are well-executed, with impressive visual effects and thrilling robot battles. However, the movie shines brightest in its quieter, more intimate moments, allowing the audience to witness the evolving bond between Noah and Mirage. These moments bring a sense of heart and humanity to the story, making it more than just a typical blockbuster.

One of the strengths of ""ROTB"" is its focus on character development. Anthony Ramos delivers a strong performance as Noah, a relatable and likable protagonist. He brings depth and emotional resonance to his role, allowing the audience to connect with his character's journey.

Another noteworthy aspect of ""ROTB"" is its nostalgic 1990s setting. The film pays homage to the original ""Transformers"" animated series, capturing the spirit and aesthetic of the era. From the soundtrack featuring iconic '90s music to the retro designs of the Transformers, the movie embraces its nostalgia without relying on it as a crutch.

While ""ROTB"" is a refreshing departure from the previous ""Transformers"" films, it still retains some of the franchise's trademark elements. There are moments of humor and lightheartedness, as well as exhilarating action sequences. However, the movie manages to find its own identity by focusing on character-driven storytelling, emphasizing the human-robot relationship.

In conclusion, ""ROTB"" is a delightful and enjoyable film that successfully revitalizes the ""Transformers"" franchise. With strong performances, a heartfelt story, and impressive visual effects, it captures the essence of the beloved characters and provides an entertaining experience for both fans and newcomers. Whether you're a fan of the Transformers or simply looking for an engaging science fiction adventure, ""ROTB"" is definitely worth watching.

285,285,2.0,"Jun 10, 2023","This is an edit of my review after rewatching this movie.

For me, after watching this movie alongside Bumblebee, I will rest on the fact that this is THE direction the franchise needs to stick with. Rise of the Beasts was surprisingly fun! This film had a lot of fun and creative action sequences. There are characters here that actually have emotions, and experience growth in the story.

In the previous films, Shia was a fun character to watch, but his acting was really strange honestly. Mark was ok, but wasn't memorable as a character. Anthony Ramos as Noah was a great character! I loved getting to see his relationship with his family, his relationship with the Autobots grow throughout the film and seeing him get involved in the action at the end. (No spoilers, but the movie gets him into the action in a creative way.)

Dominique Fishback was...fine. Not my favorite character, but she served her purpose in the film.

Pete Davidson as the Autobot Mirage was such a fun character, and it was fun seeing him interact with Noah. They worked well together.

Even Optimus has a bit of an Arc in this movie that kind of plays well with Noah's character. Peter Cullen kills it as always.

It's not a perfect movie y'all. It's not going to be for everyone. I will say that if you enjoyed Bumblebee, you might enjoy this one. It is a fun, and entertaining movie. What more can I say?

P. S.-stay for the post-credit scene. No Spoilers, but I have a feeling we might see some more surprises in the future. And maybe in places we didn't expect. ;) (Just stay for the post-credits.

296,296,1.0,"Aug 9, 2023","Perhaps the most boring movie in the Transformers franchise.

Unfortunately, this is not a movie where you can ""turn off your brain"" and enjoy it, as happens with the films of the ""Fast and the Furious"" series, or Michael Bay's ""Transformers"". Because even on a basic level, this movie is hard to enjoy.

For all its problems, ""Transformers"" from Michael Bay could entertain, at least with high-quality action (except for a fifth of the films). Even the weak fourth part even brought some good action scenes with dinobots and Optimus - knight. In ""Rise of the Beasts"", for me personally, such moments was not found.

The film is boring, unremarkable and unmemorable.

The characters are empty and not interesting - this applies to both Transformers and people. Transformers give out standard pathos phrases or cringe jokes. Human characters are played dull and weak, and their stories are absolutely not catchy. The best character is the Airplane transformer. He just decided not to act in this film and sit on the sidelines to rest. Absolutely understandable. Wheeljack is the worst - disgusting design, disgusting personality, it's a pity that he was not finished off.

Action varies from boring and unremarkable to absolutely idiotic (the character is a man in a robot suit, you get the idea). At the same time, CGI is week, which is especially noticeable in the scenes in Peru. Even the ""final"" battle turned out to be chaotic, weak and unmemorable.

A huge number of holes and stupidity in the plot, which I will not talk about to avoid spoilers. I will only say that in terms of the level of stupidity, I would put this film on a par with the already mentioned fifth part of ""Transformers"" from Michael Bay.

Constant references to the 90s, which by the end of the film begin to cause a nervous tic of the eye.

Boring and flat humor, 95% of which doesn't work.

Bottom line, don't go to the cinema to see this movie. Just wait for the digital release and watch at home. Better yet, ""find"" the movie on the internet.

Better go see Sony's new Spider-Man

304,304,3.0,"Jun 10, 2023","I'll just post a crisp and genuine review here WITHOUT spoilers :

I'm sure that this movie will be ONE OF THE BEST movies this year. Perhaps, I feel it could be quite difficult for even @michaelbay and @paramountpics to produce an even better Transformers film than Rise of the Beasts in the near future. That's my wild prediction.

Optimus Prime (voice by Peter Cullen), Mirage (voice by Pete Davidson) and Bumblebee were the stars of this film among the legendary Autobots. The leader of the Autobots effortlessly displayed his skills and bravery while Mirage stole the show with his style, accent and friendly nature.

Coming to Bumblebee, he brought the roof down in few minutes of the second half!

Talking about the Maximals, Optimus Primal (voice by Ron Perlman) and Airazor (voice by Michelle Yeoh) have earned my respect and I admire them a lot.

The lead human duo of this film, Noah (Anthony Ramos) and Elena (Dominique Fishback) did a pretty decent job in assisting the Autobots and the Maximals in the final battle. Though personally for ME, Cade Yeager the inventor (Mark Wahlberg) from Age of Extinction and The Last Knight will STILL REMAIN as my favourite hero.

Coming to the primary antagonists, the terrorcon Scourge (voice by Peter Dinklage) looked terrifying and the megavillain Unicron (voice by Colman Domingo) is a serious threat to our galaxy's existence.

I believe the latest Transformers film deserves a rating of 8 or 8.5 out of 10.

313,313,4.0,"Sep 10, 2023","It isn't saying much, but this is probably one of only three decent Transformers films. Bumblebee proved to be a good sequel, or as good as a Transformers sequel can get, and Rise follows along. It's plot isn't as convoluted as a lot of the sequels and it has a decent mix of familiar elements. Anthony Ramos of In The Heights and Dominique Fishback, coming fresh off Swarm, are the only humans featured and they're about as good as is required. Ramos' Noah is sympathetic, has charm, and is endearing enough to carry the film. Fishback is good, but her role feels undercooked, as half her job seems to only exist to push the story along.

The Transformers are as good as we've known them to be, but at this point, there's very little magic to their being brought to life. Optimus Prime, typically the beating heart of the franchise, it dull here. We get the same thing we've gotten in practically every film and it's no longer interesting. When he's in action, he's great, but every other time it's the same nobility mixed with learning how to be a better Transformer. The highlights here are Mirage, who provides much of the comic relief and has great chemistry with Noah and Razorwing. Having Michelle Yeoh voice the character adds much to her and makes her endearing.

Overall, while this isn't terrible, it's practically the same as what we've seen before. There's a thing everyone is fighting over, a bunch of bad guys who act like bad guys, and a race to stop the end of the world. The fact they bring in fan favorites, The Maximals, feels almost inconsequential. Optimus Primal, a name that got a good chuckle out of my audience when iterated, feels like a carbon copy of the Optimus Prime we've come to know, except that he turns into a gorilla instead of a vehicle. The rest, save for Razor Wing, feel practically non-existent, except when they need to spring into action.

Speaking of action, it's good here, but much of it also feels like what we've seen before. There are plenty of chases and plenty of robots fighting. Noah gets a surprisingly meaty piece of the action in the climax which, admittedly, might be one of the best action sequences of the franchise.

Knowable caracters like in the cartoon from the eightees except for Wheeljack (which was my favorite autobot growing up as a kid) he was nowhere near a volkswagen.

I really wished they would follow the 80's cartoon line, but that is too late now. There is too much contamination with other lines.

But this was a good old flashback to the 80's.

The VFX could have been a little better, sometimes it felt a little off. But the caracters where so much better then the previous movies we saw. No more that flashy flashy stuff....

322,322,8.0,"Jun 8, 2023","I think it's safe to say this franchise has had its day ten years ago. Rise of the Beasts is the prime example of how a studio just needs to leave it alone and let it have its day.

Rise of the Beasts is the latest instalment, which screams 'another one!'. This is the seventh movie since the first successful 2007 blockbuster directed by Micheal Bay. I enjoyed that one however, did we really need six more films?

If I was 10 years old this movie would have been my cup of tea. Big action with cheesy one liners and Transformers turning into the coolest cars you could ever imagine. Generally I wanted to have a good time with it. But I just couldn't get on board with it. Despite having beasts in the title I only got 15 minutes of screen time of the primals within the 2 hours.

Anthony Ramos is the highlight of the film, shining brightly. He was also fantastic in the 2020 film, 'Into The Heights', which I highly recommend. The last act was a mixed bag as the final battle commenced. The heroes and villains are battling it out, and with my disbelief it turns into a music video. Ultimately, ruining the climax. The choice of music left me cringing on my salted popcorn.

In all, Rise of the Beasts left me with one bitter taste in my mouth, due to its shockingly bad post credit scene and the idea that Hasbro generally thinks we want what they are offering. I would highly avoid this if you are looking for a film to see with your family or friends.

325,325,3.0,"Aug 6, 2023","""Work friends? You've been inside me.""

Honestly this might just be one of the most entertaining and just fun movies I've watched in a while, I've basically been a fan of the transformers franchise my whole life and I've seen every single live action transformers movie which I actually enjoyed even if that might be a hot take because people don't seem to like the bayverse films, but I thought they were dumb action fun and that's what I would expect from a series about giant robot aliens that can morph into cars, planes, boats, and even animals. I used to watch the animated transformers show constantly and I also watched the beast wars show a bunch (man has the cgi aged horribly for that show), and that's what immediately drew me to this movie in particular, because before this dropped I had completely forgotten about the maximals. So it was an incredibly welcome surprise for me to have them in a live action transformers movie and they looked amazing in my opinion. Plus this movie has Unicron in it and that's the best thing that's ever been in one of these movies, literally just a gigantic planet sized alien robot that goes around killing and destroying every planet he finds, such a cool concept and I really liked having him in the movie. Sadly he barely had any screen time though and he was just a looming threat that never actually occurred, hope he comes back in a later film.

That's something I've always liked about the live action transformers movies, how great the cgi looks on the transformers themselves. From the autobots, the decepticons, the maximals, and the new one for me in this film; the terrorcons (consisting of Scourge, Battletrap, and my personal favorite Nightbird) plus there's the predacons but they're not important. All of these characters were animated perfectly in the film and blended in so well that they just felt normal and never out of place even though they're gigantic alien robots. I really enjoyed all the unique ways they fought even if there wasn't a ton of screen time of them doing so, and their individual personalities which really helped to flesh out their character, making for a much more interesting story. I also really enjoyed their designs, especially Nightbird, the purple definitely helped and the car they turned into is so cool I loved it, it was basically just a parallel to Mirage's car but better because it was purple. One other terrorcon was basically just an opposite of an autobot as well, that being Scourge who was a truck in the same vain as Optimus Prime.

That's another thing I have always really loved about the transformers, their ability to 'transform' into something, and I don't even think it's set to be one specific thing either I'm pretty sure they can become anything really, but my main interest lies in the cars they choose to become. Everyone knows Bumblebee with his yellow striped Camaro, and Optimus Prime with the semi truck. Yet the newest addition the live action autobot roster might just be one of my favorites so far, that being Mirage (voiced by one of my favorite comedians Pete Davidson more on that later), Mirage turns into around three or four different cars in the movie, and they all look really cool, but I love the one he starts out in; a Porsche. Which is one of the best looking cars in the entire movie and I'm glad it's the one with the most screen time because it deserves it. There is one more main autobot in the film which is Arcee, who is I think one of if not the only female autobot, and she turns into a motorcylce and creates a fake driver which is awesome. There's also an Australian plane and a Spanish Volkswagen but they're not as important to the story, still cool though.

Another part of the movie I really enjoyed was the acting/voice acting. While not amazing or anytbing it is a transformers movie. I still found it to be very believable and well done. As previously mentioned I loved Pete Davidson's performance as Mirage and I think his va work is one of the biggest reasons I love the movie, he added so much personality and character to a movie that would be a lot more soulless without him, I do think what happened with mirage at the very end was weird and kind of stupid though, but I don't think it affected the overall movie as a whole all that much. The G. O. A. T. Peter Cullen returned to reprise his role as Optimus Prime and he was genuinely made to be Prime, I cannot imagine another voice behind that behemoth. Ron Pearlman voiced Optimus Primal (big monkey) and I love his voice, it definitely fits the leader role that Primal embodies and it adds a lot of charm to the character in my opinion. Michelle Yeoh was in here as Airazor and that's awesome, love seeing (or hearing) her in films, especially after Everything Eveywhere All At Once. Peter Dinklage voiced the main villain which is surprising, I can seriously never tell whenever he is voice acting in a movie because he's just so good at it. Finally Anthony Ramos did an excellent job as the main character and I think his relationship with Mirage and his little brother added the majority of the soul to the movie and made it more emotionally appealing and compelling to me, but I don't like the ending with him in the final fight though.

The story itself isn't super complex and all that different from any other transformers film, but I still really enjoyed it and I thought the stakes were just high enough that I was glued to the screen watching to see what happened next, even if it was fairly predictable. A lot of character story too, from the humans to the autobots, all delved into and expanded upon a good deal to make watching them more enjoyable. Of course the movie ends in a big cgi battle with a sky beam but I don't care that was fun as hell, I understand why people might not like this but personally I loved it.

I definitely recommend giving it a shot, especially if you're at all a fan of anything related to this franchises. I think I enjoyed it a lot more than most people would because it's been one of my favorite things since I was a kid, but I don't think that's a requirement to have a fun time with this one. Don't really need any prior knowledge going into it other than what the transformers are, but even that isn't required because the movie is practically a reboot and retells its story from near ground zero. I think most people have at least heard of (or seen) Bumblebee or Optimus Prime before though.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",work friends youve been inside me honestly this might just be one of the

Just 2 hours of some robot action with no deeper storyline, with no deep characters. Just a summer filler.

337,337,10.0,"Oct 29, 2023","While Michael Bay's Transformers films have their fans, there is no question they have issues. The last film in that series was such a disaster it's no wonder a reboot was in order. ""Bumblebee"" was the result and turned out quite good, so a sequel wasn't far, that being ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"", which promised to bring old and new generations of our favorite shape-shifting robots together for an epic clash. Did it live up to expectations?

Plot: The ultimate evil Unicron, with his legion of Terrorcons, seeks the Transwarp, a device that can transport its users to any place and time, so he can freely consume any and all planets for sustenance. To prevent the device from falling into the wrong hands, the Autobots seek aid from not only a pair of underdog humans, but also the beastly yet noble Maximals. The race is on for the fate of all worlds.

Like with ""Bumblebee"", there's a greater emphasis on characterization, story, and themes than in Bay's films. The focus here is on sacrifice, family, and seeing value in others. The human companions this time are Noah Diaz, an ex-soldier desperate to help his family in need, and Elena Wallace, an archaeologist out to prove herself in her field. As characters, they work fine within the story, having compelling reasons for going along with the Autobots and coming to satisfying conclusions. The real stars, of course, are the Transformers, who feel like genuine characters with a good range of emotions and personalities rather than just accessories that are there just because, though some get more focus than others. Optimus Prime goes through a solid arc, at first stern due to the scars of the war but growing to accept his new circumstances and the views of his allies. This is especially pushed by his newfound relationship with Optimus Primal (Ron Perlman), who suffered his fair share yet offers a fresh new perspective through own experiences, particularly with his connection to Earth. The Maximals easily steal the show whenever they're around, especially the majestic Airazor (Michelle Yeoh), though the Autobots are also pleasant company. The big standout is Mirage, who offers a few laughs but also provides some emotional support through his bond with Noah. In fact, there's quite a few good dramatic moments that elevate this beyond a mindless blockbuster.

As far as action goes, this film excels. Whereas Bayformers put such an annoying emphasis on the US military to the point of overshadowing the robots, here we purely get Transformers vs Transformers, what the franchise was built on. Each character has unique fighting styles/weapons to keep you on your toes, with the Terrorcons, led by the ruthless Scourge (Peter Dinklage), being truly formidable foes; quite refreshing to have other villains other than Megatron. The last battle where Autobots and Maximals fight side-by-side is so epic it literally had the audience cheering at a few points; very well-staged, choreographed, hard-hitting, and everyone having their moments to shine.

All in all, ROTB is a worthy film in the franchise with good action/effects but also an engaging story with high stakes and solid payoffs for its characters, not to mention a little setup at the end that had my jaw dropping. It was also nice seeing the ""Beast Wars"" characters finally come to the big screen and given their due.

The jokes do not work, the human leads of uninspiring , cinematography is just boring and the score is almost nonexistent. The social commentary feels forced and doesn't sit well with the rest of the throw away story elements. It really feels like they employed a director who was happy to point the camera at what they were told to do and wasn't allowed any of their identity in the movie at all. Unlike some I like the CGI.

353,353,9.0,"Aug 12, 2023","""Regrettably, 'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts' (2023) is another disappointing addition to the Transformers franchise. Following the relative success of 'Bumblebee', the expectations for a more rewarding viewing experience were significantly raised. However, this instalment has yet to rise to the occasion.

The film quickly falls into the trappings of a conventional Transformers movie with a worn-out script and clichés that exhaust themselves within the first 5 minutes. It's an overplayed medley of grating, corny dialogues, the regurgitated trope of a nonsensical device driving the plot, and disorienting action sequences that seem more interested in showcasing explosions than narrative coherence.

Character development is a glaring omission, with the human characters and newly introduced 'Maximals' receiving unsatisfactory screen time and poor characterization. Their portrayal is ultimately reduced to shallow attempts at humour and forced emotional beats, neither of which make a significant impact.

Furthermore, there needs to be a more comfortable sense of tokenism in the casting choices and musical selection, seemingly aimed at broadening the market appeal rather than genuinely contributing to the story.

Despite its shortcomings, the movie is full of entertainment. There are sporadic moments of excitement, but they are too few and far between, lost in the waves of mediocrity that define this instalment. It's a film that might still resonate with ardent Transformers fans, but casual moviegoers would do well to conserve their resources and give this one a miss.

359,359,1.0,"Jul 7, 2024","Too. Much. Cliche.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, the latest installment in the long-running Transformers franchise, fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors. Despite the promising premise and potential for an exciting new chapter, this film falls flat on multiple fronts, leaving fans and moviegoers feeling disappointed.

One of the biggest letdowns of Rise of the Beasts is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels convoluted and disjointed, struggling to find a cohesive narrative thread. The film attempts to introduce new characters and expand the Transformers universe by incorporating ancient lore and mythology, but these elements are poorly executed, resulting in a confusing and muddled storyline. Instead of delving into the rich history of the Transformers, the film resorts to shallow tropes and uninspired clichés.

Furthermore, the characterization in Rise of the Beasts is weak. Many of the new and returning characters lack depth and fail to make a lasting impression. The human protagonists are largely forgettable, with little development or compelling arcs. The Transformers themselves, once the heart of the franchise, are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, lacking the personality and emotional depth that made them endearing in previous films.

Another major disappointment lies in the action sequences. While the Transformers franchise has always been known for its spectacular robot battles, Rise of the Beasts falls short in this department. The action scenes feel repetitive, lacking the inventiveness and creativity that once made them a highlight of the series. The CGI, while technically impressive, fails to compensate for the lack of engaging choreography and strategic combat.

Moreover, the film suffers from pacing issues. The narrative drags in certain sections, while other moments feel rushed and underdeveloped. This uneven pacing disrupts the overall flow of the movie, preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story.

Additionally, the dialogue in Rise of the Beasts is often cringe-worthy and filled with unnecessary humor that falls flat. The attempts at injecting lightheartedness and comedic relief feel forced, further diminishing the gravitas of the film. The script lacks the wit and cleverness that characterized some of the earlier entries in the franchise, leaving the audience yearning for more substance and intelligent dialogue.

On a positive note, the film does showcase impressive visual effects and stunning set pieces. The transformations and intricate details of the Transformers are visually impressive, but unfortunately, they are not enough to salvage the overall disappointing experience.

In conclusion, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts fails to capture the magic and excitement of its predecessors. With a weak storyline, underdeveloped characters, lackluster action sequences, pacing issues, and subpar dialogue, the film leaves fans and moviegoers longing for the days when the Transformers franchise delivered thrilling and engaging cinematic experiences.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",too much cliche transformers rise of the beasts the latest installment in the longrunning transformers franchise fails to live up to the expectations set by its predecessors despite the promising premise and potential for an exciting new chapter this film falls flat on multiple fronts leaving fans and moviegoers feeling disappointed one of the biggest letdowns of rise of the beasts is its lackluster storytelling the plot feels convoluted and disjointed struggling to find a cohesive narrative thread the film attempts to introduce new characters and expand the transformers universe by incorporating ancient lore and mythology but these elements are poorly executed resulting in a confusing and muddled storyline instead of delving into the rich history of the transformers the film resorts to shallow tropes and uninspired clichés furthermore the characterization in rise of the beasts is weak many of the new and returning characters lack depth and fail to make a lasting impression the human protagonists are largely forgettable with little development or compelling arcs the transformers themselves once the heart of the franchise are reduced to onedimensional caricatures lacking the personality and emotional depth that made them endearing in previous films another major disappointment lies in the action sequences while the transformers franchise has always been known for its spectacular robot battles rise of the beasts falls short in this department the action scenes feel repetitive lacking the inventiveness and creativity that once made them a highlight of the series the cgi while technically impressive fails to compensate for the lack of engaging choreography and strategic combat moreover the film suffers from pacing issues the narrative drags in certain sections while other moments feel rushed and underdeveloped this uneven pacing disrupts the overall flow of the movie preventing the audience from fully immersing themselves in the story additionally the dialogue in rise of the beasts is often cringeworthy and filled with unnecessary humor that falls flat the attempts at injecting lightheartedness and comedic relief feel forced further diminishing the gravitas of the film the script lacks the wit and cleverness that characterized some of the earlier entries in the franchise leaving the audience yearning for more substance and intelligent dialogue on a positive note the film does showcase impressive visual effects and stunning set pieces the transformations and intricate details of the transformers are visually impressive but unfortunately they are not enough to salvage the overall disappointing experience in conclusion transformers rise of the beasts fails to capture the magic and excitement of its predecessors with a weak storyline underdeveloped characters lackluster action sequences pacing issues and subpar dialogue the film leaves fans and moviegoers longing for the days when the transformers franchise delivered thrilling and engaging cinematic experiences,NEGATIVE

373,373,4.0,"Jul 14, 2023","I love transformers 1-4 not the greatest but pretty entertaining movies but the last knight and this movie was disappointing from start to finish. In my opinion transformers ended with the dark of the moon now they repeating the same thing over and over again.

Idk why it's so hard for Hollywood to write good movies? Not every movie needs to be world ending just make good written stories revolve around autobots and decepticons and make appearances of other transformers here and there. We already seen this movie 12 years ago?

The design of primals, autobots and the enemies doesn't really go well together some of them are boxy and others are rounder it feels really weird to see them together in one frame. I like they are trying to bring all of the designs to the big screen but they need to do a better job.

And then the humans in the transformers movies if they want humans to be helping transformers and be in the battlefield they need to do better like they can show that humans made weapons from their technology and replicated to fight against them but they are still weak so they need autobots by their side.

375,375,8.0,"Jul 28, 2023","So I put this on in the background while doing some marking. I did try to give it a chance and it was enjoyable and engaging at times, but Rise of the Beasts is a very generic movie overall.

It's set in the 90s but doesn't really feel like it. I liked the musical references, mostly New York hip hop such as the Wu-Tang Clan, but a few songs and a Power Rangers shirt doesn't instantly transport us into another decade. You've got to get so many other things right - the clothes, the cars, the billboards, the way people talk, the references, the news/TV, etc. It's not easy.

The action is okay, but does nothing new. CGI just isn't that exciting by itself. You have to do something with it. There's creativity in the movement, the designs and the voices, but it's nothing special and not enough to lift a run-of-the-mill plot.

The black female character was a bit annoying and felt shoehorned in. It wasn't at all believable that she was some kind of archeologist. The main character was okay, but not all that compelling.

The villains could have been much better. Not enough of their motive was fleshed out and they didn't look that cool or interesting. Every robot has so many parts, a lot of metal and grey, so it all kind of blurs together.

This is not a terrible movie but it's very mediocre. Nothing offensively bad, but it's a lot of noise with little originality.

Additionally, starring Liza Koshy, Peter Cullen, Pete Davidson from The Suicide Squad, and Fast X, Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, and Tobe Nwigwe.

The Autobots may have found a way to get back to their planet. In order to find the Transwarp Key and keep it out of the hands of the Terrorcons, they get help from Noah (Anthony Ramos), a teen who would do anything to save his family, Elena (Dominique Fishback), who is very smart, and the Maximals, they are robots that can transform into animals. The Terrorcons want to destroy the world with the Transwarp key.

Since not all of the transformer movies have been good, I wasn't sure how Rise of the Beasts would be. However, I'm glad I found it enjoyable; it has action, a compelling storyline, and funny moments.

This had action from beginning to end, with the film starting out with a flashback of how the Autobots planet was destroyed. Then continuing with everyone trying to find the Transwarp key before the Terrorcons do.

I liked the fact that there was substance to the plot, due to Noah and Elena providing a human connection. I like that they have deeper desires other than just helping to save the world. Noah loves his family very much and wants to make sure his little brother receives good medical care. Elena is a historian who wants to get credit for her discoveries.

In addition to being a historian, Elena is also funny.

382,382,3.0,"Jun 10, 2023","Listen up, because I'm about to spill the tea. I may not be the world's biggest ""Transformers"" fan, but I've always found some level of guilty pleasure in those metal-clashing, explosion-filled spectacles. So, naturally, when ""Rise of the Beasts"" was announced, I couldn't help but get a little giddy with anticipation. After all, these movies have consistently provided me with varying degrees of entertainment. So picture this: It's Friday, June 9, 2023, and I eagerly plop down in a packed theater next to my cousin, brimming with excitement and anticipation for some mind-blowing, metal-on-metal madness. But little did I know that disappointment was lurking around the corner, ready to pounce. And boy, did it pounce with a vengeance.

Let's dive into the abyss of disappointment and talk, firstly, about the characters in ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts."" As a proud half-Hispanic (thanks, mum!), I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement seeing Anthony Ramos take the lead in ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts."" Not that I'm some diversity crusader or anything, but hey, representation matters. However, any appreciation I had swiftly evaporated when I witnessed just how poorly written his character was. And to my dismay, the same could be said for every single human character in the film. It's as if the scriptwriters took an intergalactic vacation and left the dialogue to be composed by malfunctioning Autobots. So, the human characters were as flat as yesterday's soda - I'm talking cardboard cutouts with zero depth or memorable traits that felt like they were merely there to occupy space between robot battles, offering nothing more than forced dialogue and clichéd reactions. But you're not going to see a ""Transformers"" movie for the characters! You're going because you want to see hot, sweaty, oily, robot action! So how was it? Well, let me just say, the disappointment meter reached new heights in this department.

While the film promised epic battles and mind-blowing CGI, what we got was a confusing mishmash of metal-on-metal chaos. The action sequences were so haphazardly put together that it felt like watching a tornado in a junkyard rather than a carefully choreographed spectacle. It was difficult to discern who was fighting whom, and why we should even care. Gone are the days of exhilarating and well-executed action set-pieces that kept us on the edge of our seats. Instead, we were bombarded with a borderline nonsensical onslaught of poorly edited and direction action scenes that pale in comparison to Michael Bay's cinematic spectacles; the action in ""Rise of the Beasts"" was like trying to follow a complex puzzle without all the pieces, leaving us feeling disoriented and detached from the action.

And say what you want about Michael Bay, but he knows how to make a visually appealing film. Steven Caple Jr. Does not. Gone are the sweeping shots of majestic Transformers, bathed in the golden hues of a setting sun. Instead, we were presented with lackluster cinematography that failed to capture the awe and grandeur of these colossal machines. The visual compositions felt uninspired, with generic framing and a lack of attention to detail. Even the robot designs themselves lacked the iconic flair and intricate detailing that we had grown accustomed to under Bay's direction. They appeared bland and generic, lacking the wow factor that made the Transformers so visually captivating in the past. It felt like a missed opportunity to create visually distinct and memorable characters. Furthermore, the overall visual palette of the film left much to be desired. The color grading felt dull and washed out, lacking the vibrant and explosive visual style that we associate with the franchise. It was a far cry from the eye-popping visuals that Bay's films delivered, which made even the most chaotic action sequences visually captivating. And while visuals may not be the sole reason to watch a ""Transformers"" film, they certainly contribute to the overall experience and immersion. In the case of ""Rise of the Beasts,"" the lackluster visuals added to the disappointment and further emphasized the film's shortcomings in delivering a visually appealing and memorable cinematic experience.

Alas, I did not enjoy ""Rise of the Beasts."" The film seemed to lack the heart and energy that made the previous ""Transformers"" installments enjoyable for me. The story failed to engage, and the characters left me indifferent, ultimately feeling like a missed opportunity to build upon the rich lore and mythology of the Transformers universe. And the action sequences, which are often a highlight of the franchise, did not deliver the adrenaline-pumping excitement I had come to expect; they felt uninspired and lacking in creativity, lacking the explosive and dynamic choreography that made the robot-on-robot battles so thrilling in the past. And while I acknowledge that everyone has different tastes and preferences - as audiences are seemingly eating this film up - I personally found ""Rise of the Beasts"" to be a disappointing addition

384,384,1.0,"Aug 6, 2023","Not sure why I keep coming to these; outside of the first one these Transformer movies are trash; plot makes little to no sense and it's just a giant explosion fest. At one point you really lose what is going on in some of the battles.

387,387,10.0,"Aug 1, 2023","The new transformers sticks to the tried and tested formula instead of pushing any boundaries whatsoever. But that is not what you want to hear from a Transformers review right? It was pretty good, there arent any bad moments and there were some really cool and hilarious scenes. Sure it couldve been better and not as good as BUMBLEBEE but it is clearly 2steps in the right direction. The runtime felt short but that just means less downtime. Didnt have the Bayverse production value but its clear the director knows what he is doing and only constrained by the studio he is working for. Mirage played by Pete Davidson was hands down the best part of the movie, I absolutely hate the guy but he nailed the role. The lead human for the first time was a capable and endearing human being. Wish his relationship with his little brother was more at display, actually he shouldve been part of the journey instead of the lead girl who is only there as a historian that knows things. Bumblebee who I dislike had one of the coolest scenes in any transformers movie ever. The MAXIMALS were great, I never liked BEAST WARS but I desperately wished they had more screentime. The movie looks bland at times being in a vast open field instead of cities like the Bayverse, which is why some scenes felt empty. Optimus Prime was a disappointment, shocking to say the least. As were the villains and the big baddie.

I enjoyed it, step in the right direction but not quite there yet. Hopeful for a sequel with a bigger budget and more Transformers on screen.

390,390,4.0,"Aug 19, 2023","As a lifelong fan of the Transformers franchise, I had high hopes for Transformers: Rise of the Beast, and I am thrilled to say that it exceeded all my expectations! This movie breathes new life into the iconic series, taking us on an action-packed '90s globetrotting adventure that introduces fresh faces and brings back nostalgic favorites in a way that rekindles the magic of the original animated series.

The storyline of Transformers: Rise of the Beast takes place in the 1990s, and the choice of this era was a brilliant move by the filmmakers. It immediately draws in both longtime fans and newcomers, evoking fond memories of the classic cartoon while presenting a modern and dynamic take on the Autobots and Decepticons' age-old battle. The '90s setting adds a sense of nostalgia, giving the film a distinct charm and making it relatable to audiences who grew up with the franchise.

One of the standout features of this film is the introduction of the Maximals, Predacons, and Terrorcons into the existing conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons. This expansion of the Transformer universe opens up a whole new dimension of storytelling and character dynamics. The Maximals and Predacons, in particular, bring an exciting twist to the plot, providing an engaging contrast to the familiar Autobot and Decepticon personalities. Their arrival introduces fresh perspectives, allegiances, and, most importantly, thrilling battles that are an absolute feast for the eyes.

The character development in Transformers: Rise of the Beast is exceptional. We see the Autobots and Decepticons in a new light as they navigate alliances, betrayals, and unexpected friendships amidst the escalating conflict. Moreover, the introduction of the Maximals, Predacons, and Terrorcons allows the movie to delve deep into their unique backstories and motivations, making them feel like fully realized characters, not just robotic entities.

The film's special effects and action sequences are jaw-droppingly impressive. The transformation sequences are seamless and mind-bogglingly detailed, bringing an authentic and nostalgic feeling to the screen. The battles between the various factions are epic, thrilling, and flawlessly executed, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film.

The stellar cast, led by exceptional performances, deserves a special mention. Each actor brings their A-game to their respective roles, adding layers of emotion and depth to their robot characters. The camaraderie and chemistry among the cast contribute to the film's overall enjoyment, making it an unforgettable movie experience.

Overall, Transformers: Rise of the Beast delivers on its promises and then some. It successfully expands the Transformers universe by introducing the Maximals, Predacons, and Terrorcons in a '90s globetrotting adventure, all while staying true to the essence of the original series that captured our hearts.

392,392,1.0,"Jun 10, 2023","The latest installment in the Transformers franchise, ""Rise of the Beasts"" delivers the spectacular CGI and visuals that the films are known for, but little else. The CGI animation and special effects are cutting edge as always, with amazingly rendered Transformers characters and action sequences that make you feel like you're in the middle of a massive robot war.

However, the human actors and story are forgettable. The actors seem to just be going through the motions, with uninspired and cliche-ridden dialogue throughout. The story itself is very generic, predictable and devoid of any originality or distinctiveness. It seems tailored and dumbed down for mass appeal to the lowest common denominator.

But if you're hoping for an engaging story, complex characters, clever dialogue or any semblance of plot, look elsewhere.

As well the story is not thought through. The lady who plays the archaeologist is bad.

412,412,4.0,"Jun 12, 2023","Another one in the endless string of Transformers movies, an unsolicited gift that just keeps on giving.

Just when we thought we might be in for a fresh take, the movie continues its adherence to the same worn-out formula. Explosions, high-octane chase scenes, and over-the-top action, all of which seem to have lost their charm now. Like a bad case of déjà vu, we've seen it all before, so many times over, that even the phrase 'formulaic' seems like an understatement.

I mean, there were times during the movie when I felt like I was ticking off a checklist, you know? Alien robots: check. Human characters who are there for no apparent reason: check. Global catastrophe narrowly averted: check. It's a trope-fest from start to finish, and frankly, the novelty wore off somewhere around the third or fourth movie.

It's stoic in its unwillingness to break away from its own constraints. No innovative plot, no fresh characters, just more of the same. For a franchise that's all about ""robots in disguise,"" it's a shame that it hasn't managed to disguise its repetitiveness.

So, why do we bother? Good question. Perhaps it's the hope that one day, we'll be treated to something more than a recycled plot with a new coat of CGI paint.

415,415,9.0,"Jun 11, 2023","""Rise of the Beasts"" is a sequel to the ""Transformers: Beast Wars"" TV series, featuring the Autobots, Maximals, and various intergalactic villains in pursuit of the ancient McGuffiny doohickey. It is palatable for everyone else because it demonstrates surprising care with the human beings trapped in the midst of this epic battle between good and evil. The screenplay, credited to five people, gives Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback the opportunity to create characters we might even care about. This is a rarity in this series, known more for the bland types and groan-inducing banter of the Bay movies. This movie is a prequel to ""Bumblebee"" and before the events of the first ""Transformers"". It takes place in a grungy, pre-Giuliani New York City where Ramos' Noah Diaz is a former military electronics expert looking for work to support his family, while Fishback's Elena is fighting to prove herself as an artifacts expert. These two young people of color are being repeatedly underestimated and marginalized by the predominately white people in charge, providing more context and social criticism than we usually see in these movies. Noah and Elena find themselves flung into the hunt for the Transwarp Key. Noah (Anthony Ramos) and Elena (Dominique Fishback) are two Brooklynites recruited to foil Unicron's meal plans. Noah is an ex-Army tech expert who cares for his sick little brother, while Elena is a fledgling anthropologist who knows her ancient history but isn't getting to use it in her museum day job. The plot is a step up from the Bayhem days of Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and Mark Wahlberg. Steven Caple Jr.'s ""Beasts"" boasts a diverse cast, spiffy visual effects, and big robot-battling-robot action scenes. The writing is sharper and smarter, including a knowing Marky Mark jab. While there are still lines like ""Cross my spark and hope to die,"" the characters know it's corny and go with it. Kids of the now will enjoy Davidson's comic timing and humor as Mirage, while kids of the '80s will appreciate the inclusion of Unicron, a character from the 1986 ""Transformers"" animated movie. This is a step in the right direction for a formerly flailing fan-favorite franchise, and is an enjoyable step in the right direction for a formerly flailing franchise. The Maximals are given the opportunity to shine in Rise of the Beasts due to the lack of Michael Bay action sequences. Cinematographer Enrique Chediak holds the camera steady as Autobots, Maximals, and Unicron's Terrorcon henchmen engage in their vehicular slaughters, allowing clean and crisp animation to showcase what exciting Transforms fight choreography looks like. Liza Koshy's Autobot Arcee is a guns-akimbo Ducati 916 that darts around like a seasoned assassin, while Optimus Primal employs a thunderous ground-and-pound ferocity. An array of fighting techniques from the Terrorcons keeps violent altercations fresh, such as Battletrap swinging his chain weapon or neon-pink-detailed Nightbird's aerial maneuvers that scare the engine oil out of Mirage. Rise of the Beasts allows both combatants and move combinations to shine, no more of Bay's constant cutting that makes action scenes feel like they've been run through a junkyard blender.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",rise of the beasts is a sequel to the transformers beast wars tv series featuring the autobots maximals and various intergalactic villains in pursuit of the ancient mcguffiny doohickey it is palatable for everyone else because it demonstrates surprising care with the human beings trapped in the midst of this epic battle between good and evil the screenplay credited to five people gives anthony ramos and dominique fishback the opportunity to create characters we might even care about this is a rarity in this series known more for the bland types and groaninducing banter of the bay movies this movie is a prequel to bumblebee and before the events of the first transformers it takes place in a grungy pregiuliani new york city where ramos noah diaz is a former military electronics expert looking for work to support his family while fishbacks elena is fighting to prove herself as an artifacts expert these two young people of color are being repeatedly underestimated and marginalized by the predominately white people in charge providing more context and social criticism than we usually see in these movies noah and elena find themselves flung into the hunt for the transwarp key noah anthony ramos and elena dominique fishback are two brooklynites recruited to foil unicrons meal plans noah is an exarmy tech expert who cares for his sick little brother while elena is a fledgling anthropologist who knows her ancient history but isnt getting to use it in her museum day job the plot is a step up from the bayhem days of shia labeouf megan fox and mark wahlberg steven caple jrs beasts boasts a diverse cast spiffy visual effects and big robotbattlingrobot action scenes the writing is sharper and smarter including a knowing marky mark jab while there are still lines like cross my spark and hope to die the characters know its corny and go with it kids of the now will enjoy davidsons comic timing and humor as mirage while kids of the s will appreciate the inclusion of unicron a character from the transformers animated movie this is a step in the right direction for a formerly flailing fanfavorite franchise and is an enjoyable step in the right direction for a formerly flailing franchise the maximals are given the opportunity to shine in rise of the beasts due to the lack of michael bay action sequences cinematographer enrique chediak holds the camera steady as autobots maximals and unicrons terrorcon henchmen engage in their vehicular slaughters allowing clean and crisp animation to showcase what exciting transforms fight choreography looks like liza koshys autobot arcee is a gunsakimbo ducati that darts around like a seasoned assassin while optimus primal employs a thunderous groundandpound ferocity an array of fighting techniques from the terrorcons keeps violent altercations fresh such as battletrap swinging his chain weapon or neonpinkdetailed nightbirds aerial maneuvers that scare the engine oil out of mirage rise of the beasts allows both combatants and move combinations to shine no more of bays constant cutting that makes action scenes feel like theyve been run through a junkyard blender,POSITIVE

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an awesome science fiction action film that brings new life to the franchise with an exciting new direction, action sequences, and new characters.

I am a fan of Michael Bays Transformers films which is entertaining and over the top. Steven Caple Jr. New direction with Transformers brings new life without going over the top with its humor and action. Bumblebee film was great too but was too grounded with its characters without letting the action become the distraction.

This film has a new story that brings new characters like the Maximals, terricons, and Unicron. It was nice to see the beasts on the transformers trying to protect earth from becoming the next victim to the planet eating unicron which Optimus prime and his autobots are on search for a key that the terricons are after. While Noah (Anthony Ramos) and Elena (Dominique Fishback) are trying to help the autobots get that key before going into the wrong hands.

The story is great. The action sequences are exciting. And a thrilling ride. The climax is one thrilling ride. The visual effects are amazing. Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback did great with there roles. Which they grew on me. Without going into spoilers territory the film is a fresh start to the franchise which opens up for more sequels. And spin offs to a new direction.

423,423,10.0,"Jun 14, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts Is a new movie from the Transformers movie series. This movie is directed by Steven Caple Jr. Director of Creed II. In 1994, Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos) tries to earn money to pay for his ailing little brother. When he tries to steal a car, he steals the Transformer Mirage (voice of Pete Davidson) and learns about the hidden Transformers, hiding on Earth. He also learns about the threat of Unicron a creature that feeds on planets.

Together with Elena Wallace (Dominique Fishback), he tries to help the Transformers fight against Unicron's servants, who are led by Scourge (voice of Peter Dinklage). The Transformers get help from the Maximals in this. This is the seventh live-action Transformers film in the film series. The film is set after the 2018 Transformers spin-off film Bumblebee and before the Michael Bay Transformers films. If this film gets a successful end result, it will be the beginning of a new trilogy. After directing Creed II, Steven Caple Jr. Make the Transformers movies your own now. With Creed II he managed to combine the Rocky and Creed films well. He also knew how to portray the boxing matches well. With this film he also manages to convey this clearly when different robots fight against each other. He does this more clearly than the last Michael Bay films. Only when several battles take place at the same time does the film lose some of its focus. Steven Caple Jr. Knows how to realistically place the different robots next to the people. Unfortunately, you can often see when the characters are in front of a green screen. As a result, the images can sometimes appear a bit different. So the explosions don't come across as realistic. Although Michael Bay made too much use of unnecessary explosions in his Transformers films, they came across as more realistic than the explosions in this film. The action scenes are also a bit too exaggerated at times, making it seem a bit like action from the later Fast & Furious movies. Other scenes resemble a lesser Iron Man movie. Five different writers have further worked on the script of this film. Unfortunately, it seems as if these five writers have not fully worked together, because the story sometimes comes across as a bit messy. Furthermore, the story remains on the predictable side, leaving little tension. There are also many elements in the film that have already appeared in similar ways in other Transformers films. As a result, this film sometimes comes across as a bit repetitive. The comedy isn't that strong either. Usually it is better than the more unusual comedy from Michael Bay's Transformers films. Unfortunately, it's not as funny as it tries to be. Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback do some nice acting in the film. This way they know how to carry the film like the human characters. Yet they lack a clear backstory and thanks to the messy script, you as a viewer don't really care about them either. Thanks to the script, their characters also get a lot of coincidences, so they can easily get out of situations or easily move on. The voice acting is well done. Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime again in his classic, recognizable way. Only in this film he is more suspicious of people. Pete Davidson also tries to make Mirage's acting work his own with his voice, but this one works better than the other. Peter Dinklage also knows how to voice his villain in an appropriately dark way. Furthermore, the other actors, that the other robots voice unfortunately have little time or opportunities to do something special with their roles.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",transformers rise of the beasts is a new movie from the transformers movie series this movie is directed by steven caple jr director of creed ii in noah diaz anthony ramos tries to earn money to pay for his ailing little brother when he tries to steal a car he steals the transformer mirage voice of pete davidson and learns about the hidden transformers hiding on earth he also learns about the threat of unicron a creature that feeds on planets together with elena wallace dominique fishback he tries to help the transformers fight against unicrons servants who are led by scourge voice of peter dinklage the transformers get help from the maximals in this this is the seventh liveaction transformers film in the film series the film is set after the transformers spinoff film bumblebee and before the michael bay transformers films if this film gets a successful end result it will be the beginning of a new trilogy after directing creed ii steven caple jr make the transformers movies your own now with creed ii he managed to combine the rocky and creed films well he also knew how to portray the boxing matches well with this film he also manages to convey this clearly when different robots fight against each other he does this more clearly than the last michael bay films only when several battles take place at the same time does the film lose some of its focus steven caple jr knows how to realistically place the different robots next to the people unfortunately you can often see when the characters are in front of a green screen as a result the images can sometimes appear a bit different so the explosions dont come across as realistic although michael bay made too much use of unnecessary explosions in his transformers films they came across as more realistic than the explosions in this film the action scenes are also a bit too exaggerated at times making it seem a bit like action from the later fast furious movies other scenes resemble a lesser iron man movie five different writers have further worked on the script of this film unfortunately it seems as if these five writers have not fully worked together because the story sometimes comes across as a bit messy furthermore the story remains on the predictable side leaving little tension there are also many elements in the film that have already appeared in similar ways in other transformers films as a result this film sometimes comes across as a bit repetitive the comedy isnt that strong either usually it is better than the more unusual comedy from michael bays transformers films unfortunately its not as funny as it tries to be anthony ramos and dominique fishback do some nice acting in the film this way they know how to carry the film like the human characters yet they lack a clear backstory and thanks to the messy script you as a viewer dont really care about them either thanks to the script their characters also get a lot of coincidences so they can easily get out of situations or easily move on the voice acting is well done peter cullen voices optimus prime again in his classic recognizable way only in this film he is more suspicious of people pete davidson also tries to make mirages acting work his own with his voice but this one works better than the other peter dinklage also knows how to voice his villain in an appropriately dark way furthermore the other actors that the other robots voice unfortunately have little time or opportunities to do something special with their roles,NEGATIVE

So from that, there's no new innovations, no new real concepts or ""wow"" factors. This brings us to the ""beasts"" robots, which makes absolutely zero sense. Why would robots with plasma cannons, guns, burning laser swords, etc... want to transform into animals? Would a ""punch"" really be more powerful?

However, my biggest problem with the life action transformers' concept is that they never explain why an ultra super tough ""almost invincible"" villain would suddenly turn into tin foil at the end of the film for no reason other than because the script calls for it? The same thing with the 1st Transformers movie where Megatron was seemingly invincible and then in the 2nd movie, he was made of paper despite supposely having an upgrade from the spark.

Overall the life action series suffer from weak scripts after weak scripts, written by writers who had never seen the original Transformers cartoon. They fail to connect with the audience, even with their poor attempt to contemporize with racial characteristics for the robots, in comparison to the 1984 cartoon movie.

""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" (2023) was a total dissapointment for me. Because i watched all of the previous instalments, and still think that first movie was great, and last one did it differently was pretty descent, i was kinda looking forward to this one. But ""Rise of the Beasts"" i think is on a pare with Transformers 2 - that movie was bad, this one is as well. The plot is copy / paste off all previous movies, but without any thrills. Two leads were without any charisma or chemistry. Directing was descent but its not the directors fault - the plot and story are so predictable and generic that i thought they literally were written by AI. It was very bad. There is zero characterization of leads and i couldn't care less what was happening on screen. And CGI looked worse then in previous movies.

Overall, while watching ""Rise of the Beasts"" i taught that Michael Bay's movies weren't that bad after all.

435,435,10.0,"Dec 15, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, directed by Steven Caple Jr. And produced by the infamous Micheal Bay, brings a fresh twist to the iconic franchise by introducing new robotic characters while attempting to balance the human element. While the film showcases well-executed robot designs and nostalgic nods, it falls short in terms of delivering a truly immersive Transformers experience.

Storyline and Characters: Rise of the Beasts follows a familiar pattern by placing humans at the center of the plot, a recurring theme in previous films. The reliance on human characters feels convenient, diluting the potential impact of the Transformers themselves. The plot unfolds in a relatively straightforward manner, lacking the depth and complexity that fans crave from the franchise.

Robot Designs: While some of the robot designs in Rise of the Beasts were lackluster and uninspired (Wheeljack, stratosphere. Scourge), the film does offer a handful of standout designs. Characters like Arcee, Optimus Primal, Rhinox, Cheetor, Airazor, and Bumblebee are executed well, capturing the essence of their original iterations. These designs serve as a refreshing nod to the beloved Beast Wars era and the iconic '86 movie, injecting moments of nostalgia into the film.

Balancing Act: One of the film's challenges lies in incorporating multiple elements, including Autobots, Maximals, humans, and the introduction of Unicron. This abundance of storylines and characters leads to a fragmented narrative, as the focus frequently shifts between the intense robot battles and the human characters. This imbalance leaves fans yearning for a more immersive and cohesive Transformers experience.

Character Development and Humor: Regrettably, Rise of the Beasts falls short in providing significant character development for the Transformers themselves. The movie's title suggests a focus on these iconic robotic beings, yet their growth and emotional depth take a backseat to the human-centric elements. Additionally, the film relies on cliché and occasionally cringey humor, which detracts from the overall impact of the story.

Conclusion: Transformers: Rise of the Beasts presents a mixed bag of delights and disappointments. While the well-executed robot designs and nostalgic nods to the franchise's past breathe life into the film, the overemphasis on human characters and the lack of substantial character development for the Transformers themselves hinder its potential. Despite its thrilling action sequences, the movie fails to deliver a cohesive and truly immersive Transformers experience. Perhaps future installments can find a better balance and reignite the franchise's magic for both longstanding fans and new audiences alike.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",transformers rise of the beasts directed by steven caple jr and produced by the infamous micheal bay brings a fresh twist to the iconic franchise by introducing new robotic characters while attempting to balance the human element while the film showcases wellexecuted robot designs and nostalgic nods it falls short in terms of delivering a truly immersive transformers experience storyline and characters rise of the beasts follows a familiar pattern by placing humans at the center of the plot a recurring theme in previous films the reliance on human characters feels convenient diluting the potential impact of the transformers themselves the plot unfolds in a relatively straightforward manner lacking the depth and complexity that fans crave from the franchise robot designs while some of the robot designs in rise of the beasts were lackluster and uninspired wheeljack stratosphere scourge the film does offer a handful of standout designs characters like arcee optimus primal rhinox cheetor airazor and bumblebee are executed well capturing the essence of their original iterations these designs serve as a refreshing nod to the beloved beast wars era and the iconic movie injecting moments of nostalgia into the film balancing act one of the films challenges lies in incorporating multiple elements including autobots maximals humans and the introduction of unicron this abundance of storylines and characters leads to a fragmented narrative as the focus frequently shifts between the intense robot battles and the human characters this imbalance leaves fans yearning for a more immersive and cohesive transformers experience character development and humor regrettably rise of the beasts falls short in providing significant character development for the transformers themselves the movies title suggests a focus on these iconic robotic beings yet their growth and emotional depth take a backseat to the humancentric elements additionally the film relies on cliché and occasionally cringey humor which detracts from the overall impact of the story conclusion transformers rise of the beasts presents a mixed bag of delights and disappointments while the wellexecuted robot designs and nostalgic nods to the franchises past breathe life into the film the overemphasis on human characters and the lack of substantial character development for the transformers themselves hinder its potential despite its thrilling action sequences the movie fails to deliver a cohesive and truly immersive transformers experience perhaps future installments can find a better balance and reignite the franchises magic for both longstanding fans and new audiences alike,NEGATIVE

I know it is a reboot of the franchise but if they are trying to write Bay's franchise out of history they are going in the wrong direction. This movie makes 'Transformers: The Last Knight' look like a Scorsese movie!!!!

The script is terrible and the movie is underwhelming due to its appalling casting of unknown and terrible actors, apart from the voice actors of the decepticons and autobots.

Still, it's a huge step down from the fantastic Bumblebee. I even shed some tears in BB. Here, not so much.

It doesn't help we had the most out-of-character Optimus Prime and ENORMOUSLY uncharismatic human leads. There's no one to get that emotional about or care deeply for. I guess I hope the brother gets better, but that's just because he's a little sick kid. I do have a heart, after all.

I digress, as with every...single...adventure these days, there's a McGuffin everyone's searching for and like always, for various of motives. Will the Autobots learn to work with the humans before either home worlds cease to exist?

There were strong positives, so don't get me all wrong. I still prefer these versions of the characters over any single Bay one and this definitely had a coherent plot, unlike Bay's buffoonery. I also absolutely loved the opening character's reveal I never saw coming and the finale's post-credits awesome cameo. Plus, all of the callbacks/references to the series, characters/real actors and other films around the mid-90s. Further, a ton of the time, this felt like a genuine recreation of the original TV animated show I grew up with and is still one of my all-time favorite animated shows. And finally, mercifully, the movie did get progressively better. Well, until the end with the standard, generic mindless drone final battle, that is.

Unfortunately, though, there were at LEAST 25 minutes that could've been cut. That first half DRAGGED. They did not do enough to make me care for the characters. In fact, the lead male was really unlikeable and every bit of his personality was just words to describe him. They never showed, only told. Plus, while we're dealing with ET Robots, these humans still learned at lightspeed on how to work alien machinery and weapons.

I'm still very comfortable with them ending this franchise once and for all. It had its day. The movie, Bumblebee, was a great restart only to land with mostly a dud here. It's not the worst and I'll still watch this again over any...single...Bay embarrassment again.

I'm glad I missed this in theatres, despite me loving Bumblebee. Something felt really off and it opened to almost zero internet chatter. No one spoke of this and then in about a month, it's dumped on Paramount+. Neither were a good sign.

I will give it this, however. A lot of the humor landed with my favorite by-far quote: ""Work friends? You've been inside me!""

And I'm not mad.

""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" was a movie after my own heart. It's set in NYC in 1994, so with that we are treated to some of the finest rap songs of that era. It was like taking a trip down memory lane.

But I don't want you to think that I'm easily swayed by some nice tunes. They help, but there has to be more. And there was.

The principal actors were Anthony Ramos, Dominique Fishback, Luna Lauren Velez. The main voice actors were Peter Cullen, Ron Perlman, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and John DiMaggio.

""Rise of the Beasts"" was an interstellar hunt for a Trasnwarp Key that naturally brought the giant robots to Earth. In pursuit of this key was a planet consuming being named Unicron (voiced by Colman Domingo). If his minions could get the key then Earth was doomed. It would take more than just Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and his small band of Autobots to defeat Unicron.

I thought this entire movie was an upgrade--not so much the Transformers, but the cast, the music, and the action. Anthony Ramos is an upgrade from Shia LeBouf and Mark Wahlberg, 90's hip hop is an upgrade from just about everything, and the action was an upgrade from the destruction porn they were entrenched in.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",as i watched the new transformers trailer i couldnt help but think why still i went to the movies to watch it anyway and im not mad transformers rise of the beasts was a movie after my own heart its set in nyc in so with that we are treated to some of the finest rap songs of that era it was like taking a trip down memory lane but i dont want you to think that im easily swayed by some nice tunes they help but there has to be more and there was the principal actors were anthony ramos dominique fishback luna lauren velez the main voice actors were peter cullen ron perlman peter dinklage michelle yeoh pete davidson and john dimaggio rise of the beasts was an interstellar hunt for a trasnwarp key that naturally brought the giant robots to earth in pursuit of this key was a planet consuming being named unicron voiced by colman domingo if his minions could get the key then earth was doomed it would take more than just optimus prime voiced by peter cullen and his small band of autobots to defeat unicron i thought this entire movie was an upgradenot so much the transformers but the cast the music and the action anthony ramos is an upgrade from shia lebouf and mark wahlberg s hip hop is an upgrade from just about everything and the action was an upgrade from the destruction porn they were entrenched in,POSITIVE

455,455,5.0,"Jul 13, 2023","Forging ahead following on from 2018's well-liked if far from adored Bumblebee solo outing, Paramount's new era of non-Michael Bay Transformers movies makes its next step with Rise of the Beasts, a film that will do nothing to bring new fans too the table but will likely do just enough to please those long-term fans of the property that would be thankful enough that they get a film far better than The Age of Extinction and The Last Knight here.

Directed by Creed 2's Steven Caple Jr, Rise of the Beasts takes us back to the mid 90's where Wu-Tang was king and Michael Jordan was God as we are introduced to our new human centrepieces in the forms of Anthony Ramos's Noah Diaz and Dominique Fishback's Elena Wallace and the new cinematic Transformers the Maximals, who band together with some old familiar faces to save the Earth from (you guessed it) a planet destroying entity that has carnage and chaos on his mind.

Joining our new cast members as voice presences we also get Ron Perlman, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh and Pete Davidson and of course the legendary Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and all performers both in human form and robotic form give enough energy and vibrancy to ensure it doesn't feel like someone is sleep-walking their way to a pay cheque like Mark Wahlberg did in his double bill Transformers outings and while it's now highly unlike we'll ever get that lightning in a bottle fun and creativity we got in the original Bay Transformers from 2007 (I'm not ashamed to say I enjoyed the film on its merits), Rise of the Beasts is pleasant enough in its Blockbuster like averageness.

Doing nothing offensively bad but also struggling to do much of note in its action beats, its character beats or its general delivery, Caple Jr.'s pedestrian like direction of Rise of the Beasts ensures much of the films early wins are slowly but surely lost across its thankfully not bum-numbing 2 hour running time that takes us from New York to Peru in a clearly expensive film that doesn't do a lot too stand out from the crowd, as robots go toe to toe and seemingly irrelevant humans get caught up in the mix in an increasingly uninteresting story that never thrives the way the most expectant of audiences would've been hoping for.

Achieving its most interesting and loaded moments in a final scene that is sure to get the pop-culture world talking and die-hard Hasbro fanatics more than a little excited, Rise of the Beasts is passable mindless entertainment but a far cry from the highs of the series best moments.

Final Say -

474,474,4.0,"Jul 18, 2023","There's a bit of recycled content, not surprising considering how many Transformers movies have come out to date. In being a fan and having felt that the previous installment Bumblebee was a lot more story based and really engrossed the audience, or even was just fun, this one just falls short in the writing. The new characters were cool, and they decided to put all the emphasis on a new character that wasn't Bumblebee, which was disappointing but more or less worked out. I won't say it here but look over the main cast carefully including the director, and you'll come away with what to expect as the undercurrent or vibe driving this movie. From the soundtrack choices to the dialogue with pretty much the entire sub-culture being represented, which is not to say it's a bad thing, and perhaps long overdue for a wider audience. It wasn't what I was expecting.

All in all, I'm glad I went to see it as I was long awaiting a sequel to Bumblebee as most of us probably are. The writing itself wasn't too bad as they still managed to slip in some humor here and there, but not as good as the original movie that started it all or even afterward. There are some dull dialogue scenes that probably could've been edited out. The main actor does a good job, I've not seen him in anything else. As to the plot that's probably the weakest part of this movie. While under Bay, 'Extinction' was well, something that needed to go extinct for the twenty crisscrossing plots and absolutely no direction whatsoever that undermined that movie. This movie isn't anything like that, thank goodness. Even the weaker sequels of the original Bay movies had better build up and humorous climaxes compared to this one. I think maybe they were just trying too hard and fell short of those early movies, as well as the original content that went into Bumblebee, including a much-coveted opening to that movie that takes us to Cybertron.

The characters themselves in this movie i.e., Optimus has some different characterization we've not seen before, but ends up bringing it around in the end - they had me kind of worried there. Without saying too much, don't expect too much from Bumblebee in this movie.

As to special effects they were great and the transformers themselves may have been spruced up a bit since Bumblebee, all except Optimus, for some reason he looked rather plain in most of the shots. His cameo at the end of Bumblebee the movie was far more in tune with what should have appeared here, but no idea what they were thinking.

As to the Terrorcons, they were a bit too close to the atypical Decepticon especially their leader who was probably connected to Megatron but they didn't allude to that. He came off pretty much the same. Then again what can one do to invent a new bad guy where none can live up to the Megatron character - Prime's true nemesis.

The Predacons were interesting and a nice addition overall. Their relationship to the Autobots was too vague even though they did try to explain it in the movie, it just left us with more questions. Not only where they came from but also timelines and so forth.

There's a unique idea at the end of the movie between the main character and an Autobot, that we've not seen before, which I actually thought was a pretty cool. I'll likely rent it when it comes out and watch it again, hoping to maybe pick up on some missing plot queues. I think they just ran out of ideas literally for this film. Since other reviewers mention that this movie deals with Unicron, I'll just confirm it here. At least the writers remembered to have the characters ask the important question at the end which leads to a sequel.

Honestly though, bringing Unicron into this contradicts the ""Last Knight"", however, at least it is in keeping with the original cannon.

For all that was presented on screen, Bumblebee the movie still outshines this despite more action sequences here and many more transformers on screen.

Also, in case anyone is wondering, this movie is kid friendly with very minimal Bay bodily humor, and absolutely nothing 'disturbing' or agenda driven as with so much Disney content nowadays. So, watch away, and maybe you'll like it well enough or more so.

I wish it had the depth of previous installments, but unfortunately it felt too shallow, even with humor scenes, or the characters that might have had real development but basically didn't, to just overall making the movie more endearing to the audience.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",theres a bit of recycled content not surprising considering how many transformers movies have come out to date in being a fan and having felt that the previous installment bumblebee was a lot more story based and really engrossed the audience or even was just fun this one just falls short in the writing the new characters were cool and they decided to put all the emphasis on a new character that wasnt bumblebee which was disappointing but more or less worked out i wont say it here but look over the main cast carefully including the director and youll come away with what to expect as the undercurrent or vibe driving this movie from the soundtrack choices to the dialogue with pretty much the entire subculture being represented which is not to say its a bad thing and perhaps long overdue for a wider audience it wasnt what i was expecting all in all im glad i went to see it as i was long awaiting a sequel to bumblebee as most of us probably are the writing itself wasnt too bad as they still managed to slip in some humor here and there but not as good as the original movie that started it all or even afterward there are some dull dialogue scenes that probably couldve been edited out the main actor does a good job ive not seen him in anything else as to the plot thats probably the weakest part of this movie while under bay extinction was well something that needed to go extinct for the twenty crisscrossing plots and absolutely no direction whatsoever that undermined that movie this movie isnt anything like that thank goodness even the weaker sequels of the original bay movies had better build up and humorous climaxes compared to this one i think maybe they were just trying too hard and fell short of those early movies as well as the original content that went into bumblebee including a muchcoveted opening to that movie that takes us to cybertron the characters themselves in this movie ie optimus has some different characterization weve not seen before but ends up bringing it around in the end they had me kind of worried there without saying too much dont expect too much from bumblebee in this movie as to special effects they were great and the transformers themselves may have been spruced up a bit since bumblebee all except optimus for some reason he looked rather plain in most of the shots his cameo at the end of bumblebee the movie was far more in tune with what should have appeared here but no idea what they were thinking as to the terrorcons they were a bit too close to the atypical decepticon especially their leader who was probably connected to megatron but they didnt allude to that he came off pretty much the same then again what can one do to invent a new bad guy where none can live up to the megatron character primes true nemesis the predacons were interesting and a nice addition overall their relationship to the autobots was too vague even though they did try to explain it in the movie it just left us with more questions not only where they came from but also timelines and so forth theres a unique idea at the end of the movie between the main character and an autobot that weve not seen before which i actually thought was a pretty cool ill likely rent it when it comes out and watch it again hoping to maybe pick up on some missing plot queues i think they just ran out of ideas literally for this film since other reviewers mention that this movie deals with unicron ill just confirm it here at least the writers remembered to have the characters ask the important question at the end which leads to a sequel honestly though bringing unicron into this contradicts the last knight however at least it is in keeping with the original cannon for all that was presented on screen bumblebee the movie still outshines this despite more action sequences here and many more transformers on screen also in case anyone is wondering this movie is kid friendly with very minimal bay bodily humor and absolutely nothing disturbing or agenda driven as with so much disney content nowadays so watch away and maybe youll like it well enough or more so i wish it had the depth of previous installments but unfortunately it felt too shallow even with humor scenes or the characters that might have had real development but basically didnt to just overall making the movie more endearing to the audience,NEGATIVE

476,476,5.0,"Oct 9, 2023","Firstly: Unicron or Galactus. Both of these two beings feed on planets. However I think the difference is that while Unicron devours planets whole, Galactus simply drains life out of planets,

So you should see the Origin Of The Silver Surfer episodes from the Silver Surfer animated series. Also Star Trek The Next Generation has two episodes ""Data Lore"" and ""Silcon Avatar"", both featuring an entity that drains life from all living beings.

But lets get back to this film. It is a spin off of the Beast Wars Transformers franchise which was a CGI animated series. I remember it well because I saw quite a few episodes and it remained in my memory because the show was put well together.

This movie's main plot deals with a ""key"" that now resides on Earth and is sought after by the planet devourer Unicron. The rest of the plot deals with the battle for the possession of the key. For me the cast and script was more than adequate and the action sequences decent. The human actors in the film give a professional performance and don't overact. Overall a decent watch and a movie you can add to your collection as a standalone Transformers film.

More Robot movies: Assassin (1986), Batteries Not Included (1987), D. A. R. Y. L.(1985), The Vindicator(1986), Programmed To Kill(1987), Cy Warrior(1989), Eve of Destruction(1991), Project Shadowchaser(1992) and Evolver(1995).

Don't blame the actors for a bad script and bad directing. I actually liked the actors a lot, but felt sorry for them in many scenes for the dialogue they had to deliver.

Transformer movies, with the exception of Bumblebee, have never been anything to use in the same sentence with words like ""smart"" or ""intelligent"", but they were entertaining nonetheless. But THIS one here takes the cake in just plain stupidity. Not suspension of disbelief, just plain stupidity. The couple of minutes of ""story"" between (world-class) CGI orgies make the last two Fast and Furious movies seem like sophisticated pieces of deep philosophy and the holes in the plot are so huge, you could drive a dozen Optimus Primes through them.

There was however an air of optimism with the recent Bumblebee movie - which was fresh, heartwarming and a welcome change from the previous instalments that kept getting worse and worse

Finally, it was a good Transformers movie (not seen since the very first one).

But with this one - Rise Of The Beasts - we've gone back to the cheesy tropes of the other movies that offer nothing exciting or fresh. A pretty big disappointment considering how good Bumblebee was.

505,505,2.0,"Jun 9, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts left me utterly disappointed and questioning the choices made by the filmmakers. From terrible casting decisions to a lackluster storyline, this installment of the Transformers franchise failed to deliver on multiple fronts.

Let's start with the casting choices, which were nothing short of disastrous. The actors chosen for key roles felt completely miscast and lacked the charisma and depth required to bring their characters to life. It seemed as though the casting directors either didn't understand the essence of the characters or simply didn't care. As a result, the performances felt forced and uninspiring, leaving me disconnected from the film.

Moreover, the storyline in Rise of the Beasts was a convoluted mess. It felt like a patchwork of random ideas stitched together without any coherent narrative thread. The plot twists were poorly executed, often leaving me scratching my head in confusion rather than engaged in the story. It was evident that the writers struggled to find a cohesive direction, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience for the audience.

Furthermore, the film seemed to rely excessively on mindless action sequences at the expense of meaningful character development and storytelling. Explosions and visual effects can only carry a film so far, and in this case, they couldn't compensate for the lack of substance. The once-rich Transformers universe felt reduced to a shallow, spectacle-driven spectacle.

Additionally, the dialogue throughout the movie was cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and cheesy one-liners that fell flat. It felt as though the writers relied on tired tropes instead of crafting engaging and authentic interactions between the characters. This further contributed to the overall lack of emotional investment and made it difficult to connect with the story on any level.

While the special effects were impressive in some instances, they alone cannot salvage a film that is plagued by poor casting choices, a weak storyline, and uninspired writing. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts fails to live up to the legacy of the franchise and left me longing for the days when the series showcased memorable characters, compelling narratives, and genuine excitement.

In conclusion, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts missed the mark on numerous fronts, including terrible casting choices, a poorly constructed storyline, and lackluster dialogue. This installment failed to capture the essence of what made the franchise successful in the past and left me disappointed and disengaged throughout.

As a fan of the Transformers franchise, I was eagerly looking forward to ""Transformers Rise of the Beasts."" However, after watching the film, I couldn't help but feel thoroughly disappointed by the end result. This installment failed to capture the magic and excitement that made the earlier films so enjoyable.

One of the most glaring issues with ""Transformers Rise of the Beasts"" is its convoluted and messy plot. The story lacks coherence, jumping from one scene to another without providing proper context or development. It felt like a collection of random events pieced together haphazardly, leaving me confused and disconnected from the narrative. The film tried to introduce new elements and expand the Transformers universe, but the execution was sloppy and unsatisfying.

Furthermore, the character development was severely lacking. The human characters were bland and forgettable, lacking any depth or relatability. The interactions between the humans and the Transformers felt forced and lacked the emotional impact that was present in the earlier films. The new robot characters introduced in this installment were also underutilized and didn't leave a lasting impression.

Another major letdown was the action sequences. While the Transformers franchise is known for its spectacular and thrilling battles, ""Rise of the Beasts"" fell short in this regard. The action scenes were poorly choreographed and lacked the excitement and intensity that fans have come to expect. The visual effects, which were once a highlight of the franchise, were mediocre at best, failing to deliver the wow factor that the previous films achieved.

Additionally, the dialogue in the film was cringe-worthy and uninspired. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the script lacked the wit and cleverness that could have injected some much-needed life into the movie. It felt like the writers didn't put much effort into crafting engaging and memorable lines for the characters.

Overall, ""Transformers Rise of the Beasts"" was a major letdown. It lacked a coherent plot, engaging characters, and thrilling action sequences. It felt like a cash grab rather than a passionate continuation of the beloved franchise. As a fan, it pains me to say that this film tarnished the legacy of the Transformers series.

Along with Bumblebee, we get Mirage excellently voiced by Pete Davidson, keeping the entertainment intact. But the proceedings were too predictable and overdose of action involving less of the humans does get tiring after a while.

There are barely few standout moments, the ones that exists are owned by Mirage and Bumblebee. It is the post credit scene that adds some intrigue. Otherwise, Rise of the Beasts delivers the same stuff the other 6 films in the franchise did and if one expects nothing more than that then this will be an harmless watch.

517,517,5.0,"Sep 2, 2023","I'm a sci-fi geek that loves robots and futurism, but even my zeals have limits when it comes to a poorly-made film. There were so many epic shots and could've-been heartfelt moments that weren't even close to hitting the mark of remarkable. Every scene came across as stale footage with zero emotional strings attached. To give you the full picture, here's some major points about my experience.

3. Recycled Content/Ideas

Understandably, you don't always have to reinvent the wheel, but you have to have some aspect of originality. Everything in the movie felt seen, like I've already crossed the road a million times over. Fight scenes that should've been energetic seemed flat and boo-worthy. So what there are robots blasting laser beams at each other. Am I supposed to gawk because I see a Transformers logo and some slow-mo kicks?

2. Static Characters

What really took me to Snooze Town was how artificial the characters came across. You would think that humans would be the most relatable; it turns out that hieroglyphics had more dimensions than them all. I can handle some cringy jokes, but deliberately minimizing everyone's arc to heroes that save the day (eventually) is just so tried and tired. It's monotone heroism, and heroes that you don't care to save the day are the worst ones to have.

1. Zero Substance

For the grand prize, the film couldn't induce emotions in two hours!! I wasn't even close to crying for any losses or tragedies in the movie. A scene was either dry or cheesy, both of which leaves an unsettling taste in your mouth. And the actors, the cinematography cannot be the ones to blame! It's the BORING lines and dull acts. No amount of CGI can redeem an underdeveloped script. In short, it would've made a better 20-minute episode adapted for kids.

All that to say, it will disappoint you. I wasn't a die-hard Transformers fan before, and I certainly won't be one now.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",im a scifi geek that loves robots and futurism but even my zeals have limits when it comes to a poorlymade film there were so many epic shots and couldvebeen heartfelt moments that werent even close to hitting the mark of remarkable every scene came across as stale footage with zero emotional strings attached to give you the full picture heres some major points about my experience recycled contentideas understandably you dont always have to reinvent the wheel but you have to have some aspect of originality everything in the movie felt seen like ive already crossed the road a million times over fight scenes that shouldve been energetic seemed flat and booworthy so what there are robots blasting laser beams at each other am i supposed to gawk because i see a transformers logo and some slowmo kicks static characters what really took me to snooze town was how artificial the characters came across you would think that humans would be the most relatable it turns out that hieroglyphics had more dimensions than them all i can handle some cringy jokes but deliberately minimizing everyones arc to heroes that save the day eventually is just so tried and tired its monotone heroism and heroes that you dont care to save the day are the worst ones to have zero substance for the grand prize the film couldnt induce emotions in two hours i wasnt even close to crying for any losses or tragedies in the movie a scene was either dry or cheesy both of which leaves an unsettling taste in your mouth and the actors the cinematography cannot be the ones to blame its the boring lines and dull acts no amount of cgi can redeem an underdeveloped script in short it wouldve made a better minute episode adapted for kids all that to say it will disappoint you i wasnt a diehard transformers fan before and i certainly wont be one now,NEGATIVE
518,518,1.0,"Jul 12, 2023","We find a film that shimmers with the undeniable influence of cinematic titans Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay. Despite the curious absence of Bay's pyrotechnic flare, their touch is subtly woven into the fabric of this narrative, lending it a sheen of credibility.

This new chapter in the Transformers saga brims with a rejuvenated spirit. The promise of a trilogy looms on the horizon, and if it keeps faith with the original narrative whilst exploring new storylines, it could well herald a revival of this beloved franchise.

Veering off the beaten path, the film brings in fresh characters and perspectives, breaking away from the Transformers norm. The shift from the conventional blonde beauty to an intellectually-driven female lead adds depth and richness, creating a multi-layered cinematic experience.

However, to achieve a truly standout narrative, the film could benefit from further innovation. Jettisoning the oft-repeated theme of a world on the brink of destruction, and exploring novel existential threats, could offer a more engaging and dynamic plot that pulls the audience deeper into the realm of Transformers.

While the intricacy and allure of the robot designs from the previous entries are missed, the visual effects hold their own, particularly during the climactic battles that fill the final 30 minutes, providing a feast for the senses that's hard to dismiss.

The auditory journey is equally engaging, marked by the nostalgic return of the ""No Sacrifice No Victory"" theme, enhanced by a selection of fresh tracks. This engaging soundscape resonates throughout, encapsulating the emotion and intensity of the narrative.

In conclusion, while ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" shows promise and offers a quality viewing experience - worthy of a solid 6 out of 10 on my scorecard - it still holds room for growth. By delving deeper into uncharted narrative territory and introducing fresh challenges, this film hints at the potential return to the glory days of the classic Transformers saga.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",we find a film that shimmers with the undeniable influence of cinematic titans steven spielberg and michael bay despite the curious absence of bays pyrotechnic flare their touch is subtly woven into the fabric of this narrative lending it a sheen of credibility this new chapter in the transformers saga brims with a rejuvenated spirit the promise of a trilogy looms on the horizon and if it keeps faith with the original narrative whilst exploring new storylines it could well herald a revival of this beloved franchise veering off the beaten path the film brings in fresh characters and perspectives breaking away from the transformers norm the shift from the conventional blonde beauty to an intellectuallydriven female lead adds depth and richness creating a multilayered cinematic experience however to achieve a truly standout narrative the film could benefit from further innovation jettisoning the oftrepeated theme of a world on the brink of destruction and exploring novel existential threats could offer a more engaging and dynamic plot that pulls the audience deeper into the realm of transformers while the intricacy and allure of the robot designs from the previous entries are missed the visual effects hold their own particularly during the climactic battles that fill the final minutes providing a feast for the senses thats hard to dismiss the auditory journey is equally engaging marked by the nostalgic return of the no sacrifice no victory theme enhanced by a selection of fresh tracks this engaging soundscape resonates throughout encapsulating the emotion and intensity of the narrative in conclusion while transformers rise of the beasts shows promise and offers a quality viewing experience worthy of a solid out of on my scorecard it still holds room for growth by delving deeper into uncharted narrative territory and introducing fresh challenges this film hints at the potential return to the glory days of the classic transformers saga,POSITIVE
519,519,2.0,"Jun 11, 2023","The Transformers movies have slowly been dropping in quality and substance for a while now. The first Transformers (2007), was very good. The third film, Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), was good, but actually the best Hasbro film, since then, has been Battleship (2012). Bumblebee (2018), wasn't too bad either, but it has been a rough-going, since the early days of the Michael Bay-directed, Transformers movies. Things don't improve here with the seventh installment in the franchise either, but there are some good points to be found too. In Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023), I was impressed with the special effects and CGI used in the film. Also, the writers and animators, produced a group of interestingly creative characters, directly related to the robot designs and their personalities.

Our main antagonist, is a fan-favorite character, first introduced in movie theaters, in the great animated film, Transformers, the Movie (1986). He is a giant, planet-sucking, Transformer-God, known as Unicron (voice of Colman Domingo). Unicron has an interesting resemblance to Marvel's, planet-eating, cosmic entity, Galactus. Without getting into the plot too much, our main, human character in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023), is Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos). Noah, is a guy, with a sick little brother, no insurance and no job. He is an ex-soldier, trained in electronics (of course), who becomes the new Shia LaBeouf, Mark Walberg or even, Hailee Steinfeld, lead character of the franchise. In Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023), we are now in the the 1990s. Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) and the Autobots, find themselves embroiled in another fight, not with the Decepticons this time, but with new bad-guy robots, the Terrorcons. As the film moves along, Noah begins to form a bond with the Autobot, known to fans, as Mirage (voice of Pete Davidson). Eventually, Mirage has to give parts of his body to Noah, in order to create a protective suit, so Noah can fly around, shoot lasers and look a lot like Iron-Man. In order for Unicron to gain the power he needs, towards access to unlimited planets, he has the Terrorcons search for the Trans-warp Key.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023), is one of the movies, I will be adding to my E for Effort List. I still recommend ""E for Effort"" films, because there is still enough in the film, for either, an entertaining night or at least, an interesting one. They are films, that could have been really good, but for some reason or another, one huge blemish, technical problem or a behind-the-scenes stigma, causes the film to go off course. This also could be related to story substance, related to budgetary headaches, which affects the pacing of the film. It is the idea, that if the director, Steven Caple Jr., could change or fix one thing, it could be the difference between a bad movie or a great film. It gets an ""E For Effort"". In this case, for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023), the blemish in the room, develops into a blatant copy of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film has its moments, but is bogged-down by a familiarity, that ruins parts of the movie. I still recommend the film, especially if you decide to watch the whole franchise together. You need to include this film in the viewing rotation, especially once you see the very end of this film, because it looks like, Hasbro has some interesting things, in-store, for the future of the franchise. There also is a pretty talented voice-cast in this film too. Along with Pete Davidson, this includes the Maximals characters, Ron Perlman, as Optimus Primal and Michelle Yeoh as Airazor. Peter Dinklage is cast, as the voice of Scourge, the right-hand Terrorcon to Unicron, which looks every bit, like he is a herald for Unicron, just like the Sliver Surfer is a herald for Galactus.

I did like how the protagonist wasn't entirely useless like in almost all other movies.

But his character was definitely catered a little too much to stereotypes.

To be honest, I wonder if the movie would have been better without him entirely, and only focusing on the transformers.

For the main thing of this movie, more screen time for the beasts would have made it better as well.

Heck, literally beasts is in the title, and they barely showed up.

I wonder if they ran out of budget for animating the beasts, or something.

Also the final battle's mood just completely fell flat for me.

I get that using pop music aimed towards teenagers was the goal, but there are better pop music choices if that was their idea.

The music for the final battle was completely out of place, and ruined the climax.

They should have chosen a more action oriented track, or just have kept to the epic orchestral sound track they always use.

Having the epic orchestral music playing like in the previous movies would have helped the climax way better.

Rather than making it fall flat.

The storyline seems like it had potential to be something great, but in the end it just left me lost and confused. Had to spend a couple hours on wikipedia to understand the beast wars storyline. Anyway story wise movie failed.

The cast was terrible and reflected one thing only and that was racially diverse casting. I am Indian and would rather see Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and Mark Duhamel in any Transformers movie over a Indian, Black, Latino actor etc. I'm not a fan of Mark Wahlberg's Transformers movies but hey I'd rather see him then the lead actress and actor they have in Rise Of Beasts.

525,525,1.0,"Jun 12, 2023","This is the first Transformer-titled movie to not be directed by Michael Bay. Bumblebee (2018) was a breath of fresh air from the ridiculously stupid Michael Bay movies. It gave me hope that the Transformers franchise will be able to finally accelerate in a good direction. However, is this actually the case? Or does it just fumble like the old entries?

Firstly, the design of the transformers is great. I love that they are a lot more colourful with distinct looks which makes it easier to recognise who is who. There are new Beast Transformers called the Maximals and they look terrific. The action scenes are also way more visible and easier to comprehend what is going on compared to the Bay movies. The action is incredibly entertaining with great choreography. The story also gives a proper character arc for Optimus Prime which is interesting. We don't see this side to his character so I quite liked it.

In terms of the human characters. I think Noah played by Anthony Ramos is okay. He has a sympathetic story about his very ill brother he takes care of and not being able to get a job. He also has good chemistry with the Transformers, most notably Mirage voiced by Pete Davidson. On that note, Pete Davidson does a good job of making the character likeable without being overly annoying. The legendary Peter Cullen continues to voice Optimus and he is still awesome. Michelle Yeoh is enjoyable as the Maximal Airazor, and Ron Perlman is great as Optimus Primal and does a good job of making him sound like an equivalent leader to Optimus. Peter Dinklage as the villain Scourge is great too.

However, despite the title being about the rise of the beast, the Maximals are barely involved in the film. They are there at the beginning and in the 3rd act but that is really in. Plot-wise, they don't contribute much which is massively disappointing. There are just too many characters in this film and unfortunately, many of them barely get any dialogue or personality. This is notable with the Maximals Cheetor and Rhinox and even some of the Autobots. The 3rd act is a little dull to look at as well with its very grey landscape. There is also a very overdone cliche that is used here which has been used in a lot of superhero movies. The script is also kind of cringy and corny. Some jokes did land but there are definitely a fair amount of weak dialogue that doesn't feel natural.

The plot is also very basic and has been done twice already in this franchise. A human meets a Transformer and gets scared but then help each other to take out some evil robot who wants to destroy the planet. It's weird that they keep doing the same formula. The 3rd act also has so many ridiculous plot conveniences to keep the humans involved in the plot. I also found the human and Transformer friendship to be weaker than Bumblebee (2018). They just don't invest enough time into it for me to care. I dislike the stupidity of the villains as well. They have opportunities to kill the characters but never do. E.g. They could kill the humans but instead they send silly spider things that can somehow be hurt by a stick.

Overall, it's a fine Transformer movie. It definitely isn't as good as the previous entry Bumblebee or even as entertaining as the First Bay Transformer movie. It does a lot of things better than those but there are a lot of weak elements as well. This is a step in the right direction and the ending certainly made me interested in the future of this franchise. I hope to see them truly Transform this franchise for the better though.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",this is the first transformertitled movie to not be directed by michael bay bumblebee was a breath of fresh air from the ridiculously stupid michael bay movies it gave me hope that the transformers franchise will be able to finally accelerate in a good direction however is this actually the case or does it just fumble like the old entries firstly the design of the transformers is great i love that they are a lot more colourful with distinct looks which makes it easier to recognise who is who there are new beast transformers called the maximals and they look terrific the action scenes are also way more visible and easier to comprehend what is going on compared to the bay movies the action is incredibly entertaining with great choreography the story also gives a proper character arc for optimus prime which is interesting we dont see this side to his character so i quite liked it in terms of the human characters i think noah played by anthony ramos is okay he has a sympathetic story about his very ill brother he takes care of and not being able to get a job he also has good chemistry with the transformers most notably mirage voiced by pete davidson on that note pete davidson does a good job of making the character likeable without being overly annoying the legendary peter cullen continues to voice optimus and he is still awesome michelle yeoh is enjoyable as the maximal airazor and ron perlman is great as optimus primal and does a good job of making him sound like an equivalent leader to optimus peter dinklage as the villain scourge is great too however despite the title being about the rise of the beast the maximals are barely involved in the film they are there at the beginning and in the rd act but that is really in plotwise they dont contribute much which is massively disappointing there are just too many characters in this film and unfortunately many of them barely get any dialogue or personality this is notable with the maximals cheetor and rhinox and even some of the autobots the rd act is a little dull to look at as well with its very grey landscape there is also a very overdone cliche that is used here which has been used in a lot of superhero movies the script is also kind of cringy and corny some jokes did land but there are definitely a fair amount of weak dialogue that doesnt feel natural the plot is also very basic and has been done twice already in this franchise a human meets a transformer and gets scared but then help each other to take out some evil robot who wants to destroy the planet its weird that they keep doing the same formula the rd act also has so many ridiculous plot conveniences to keep the humans involved in the plot i also found the human and transformer friendship to be weaker than bumblebee they just dont invest enough time into it for me to care i dislike the stupidity of the villains as well they have opportunities to kill the characters but never do eg they could kill the humans but instead they send silly spider things that can somehow be hurt by a stick overall its a fine transformer movie it definitely isnt as good as the previous entry bumblebee or even as entertaining as the first bay transformer movie it does a lot of things better than those but there are a lot of weak elements as well this is a step in the right direction and the ending certainly made me interested in the future of this franchise i hope to see them truly transform this franchise for the better though,POSITIVE

532,532,8.0,"Jul 15, 2023","This Transformers flick doesn't quite possess the charm of 2018's Bumblebee, though it's still way better than the last few Michael Bay entries. The emotional core remains with the human characters, and even with a generic save-the-universe plot that simply trudges along from point A to B to C, it works partially owing to some cool transformation scenes, solid scoring choices, and ""clearer"" set pieces (even if they're repetitive).

Dominique Fishback is reduced to being the nerd here, and the motivations that drive the human protagonists to join the Autobots, and eventually the Maximals, are pretty boringly written.

537,537,2.0,"Jun 9, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beast ventures into uncharted territory by introducing the Maximals in a live-action setting, a move that held promise but ultimately falls short. The film lacks a coherent explanation of who the Maximals are and their place in the Transformers universe, leaving audiences puzzled about their role and allegiance. The absence of clarity regarding the opposing faction's identity adds to the confusion, failing to establish a clear connection with the broader Transformers lore.

Positioned as a sequel to the enjoyable ""Bumblebee,"" Rise of the Beast disappointingly neglects to build upon its predecessor's narrative or establish meaningful links between the two films. The decision to introduce Noah Diaz and Elena Wallace as the main characters proves regrettable, as their characters come across as grating and fail to evoke any genuine connection or empathy, making their presence on screen more of an annoyance than an asset.

The return of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime remains a highlight, as his iconic voice continues to define the character. Ron Perlman's portrayal of Optimus Primal surpasses expectations, delivering a commendable performance that fits the character well. Pete Davidson's take on Mirage, reminiscent of ""Jazz"" from the 2007 Transformers film, offers a decent performance, although some of the humor falls flat. While other Transformers characters make appearances, they fail to leave a lasting impression or bring anything truly exceptional to the table.

The inclusion of ""OG"" Transformers provides a nostalgic touch, but it's not sufficient to salvage the lackluster narrative. The film suffers from poor pacing and subpar writing, showcasing the inexperience of director Steven Caple Jr. And the writing team in the Transformers franchise.

544,544,10.0,"Jun 20, 2023","A popular franchise over the course of years, Transformers is back with a different director, but with a similar story and not so cool CGI battles.

There are a few bright spots in Rise of the Beasts, but these are largely overshadowed by a lot of generic parts that would not be out of place in any of the previous six Transformers movies. Director Steve Caple, known for directing Creed, takes over the direction responsibility of this new outlet of a decade popular franchise. The output was however not something that can erase the abomination that the last 2 parts of the series marked. A simple-minded strain of giant-robot combat. Much in need of a script tune-up, it's a less-than-meets-the-eye summer-movie machine, and not a particularly well-oiled one.

It would have been a better story. At this point, I'm wishing for Bay to return to the franchise. His stories at least had some consequences for the humans. The writers make a human a super transformer, which is just lazy.

546,546,5.0,"Jul 15, 2023","Nothing could've prepared me for how enjoyable of an experience this was.

Rise of the Beasts is not only my favorite of the franchise, it's also a contender for the most entertaining movie of the year thus far.

Going in I had little hope that this movie would be anything more than a bland and empty continuation of a franchise that had all but fallen off before the previous Bumblebee film. If I were to have made a Top 10 Anticipated Movies of 2023, this wouldn't have cracked it.

I am happy to say I was more than surprised with how much heart this had and how well executed it was. At many moments throughout its fine tuned 2h7m runtime I found myself smiling from ear to ear and getting so lost in the experience I couldn't help but get goosebumps.

I got to see an early screening and the audience gave a clap at a variety of moments in each act, and I can say almost every clap was deserved. By the end we were left with our jaws on the floor (IYKYK) and the room lit up with chatter.

This installment finally finds a perfect balance between humans and the Transformers that has lacked in the past, and masterfully toes between kick ass action and organic humor.

While many of the tropes used in the movie should come off as cheesy, corny, and predictable, it almost always finds a way to feel fresh and lands each plot point with ease.

The film is not without its faults though. After some of the excitement had worn off (nearly an hour following departure) I noticed some plot holes and remembered a pair of moments where the CGI didn't feel natural. But honestly aside from a few cynical nitpicks, I can't find anything I didn't fully enjoy.

Rise of the Beasts nails the tone of what a Transformers film should be and breathes new life into both the franchise and the popcorn-flick landscape. It delivers in ways you don't even expect it to and is a truly an captivating experience. If you wanna have a fun time at the theaters, this is the movie to see.

563,563,3.0,"Jul 14, 2023","Amazing The Bay films had action but the characters were little more than killing machines. Bumblebee had great characters but minimal action.

Rise of the Beasts combines the best of both worlds. Here both the human and robot casts are interesting and have personality (with the robots being distinguishable between one another) and the action is arguably the best in the series yet (I say series though this is evidently a reboot of Michael Bay's films and follows on from Bumblebee).

I went into this film skeptical to say the least. I doubted with all the hell the film end of Transformers has gone through whether this would be any good. I was also concerned about Pete Davidson voicing one of the primary robots (Mirage).

But the film met my concerns with full force as it came out spectacular. As I said before it was fun, funny and I was interested in the characters. Even Pete Davidson who I'm not a fan of turned out great with Mirage being both fun and emotional.

The film has gone through a lot of changes. I feel that if some of the reported deleted scenes were present it would be much better. As great as every character is Optimus Prime wears his violent and bitter side too prominently. One of the reported deleted scenes (which I won't go into detail of here) would have justified this much more.

The film does a lot of world building though lacking in detail. The opening scene was a shock but instantly got me hooked by what it shows. When it comes to the rest of the film things are explained though a more casual viewer would likely have preferred more clarity. The final scene is one to wait for if you're excited to see how the new universe will expand.

The scenes flow well, nothing was obvious jarring exposition, the humans responded believably to what they witnessed.

While it did a much better job at striking the balance between human scenes and transformer scenes than previous films, cutting out the human protagonists would've made it much better. All we needed were the Autobots and the Maximals, it would've given us a lot more time to understand Optimus Primal and this new flavor of Optimus Prime. Everyone's lacking in the depth department because the humans rob the transformers' screentime.

569,569,4.0,"Jun 11, 2023","This movie I would probably rate an 8/10 but because of the heavily fan service done throughout the movie & at the special endings credits scene I have upped it to 9/10.

Sure this film does have flaws such as the lack of Predacons & Decepticons, their was only 1 Predacon sadly, but I believe maybe in the next film they will now have a chance to introduce the Predacons next with some more Maximals to appear maybe?

Another flaw I disliked is that the lack of names spoken, I mean the Terrorcons you wouldnt even know most of their names unless you googled it.

Overall though this film has been a major Fan service which I truly love, not only do we get to see our childhood cartoon characters in Beast Wars comes alive but also in the special ending credits we get a very insane surprise!! If you dont give this movie extra points for their creativity too finally do this surprise credits ending then I duno what will? Literally this is almost every fans dream growing up to see it come to fruition.

I seen some reviews below giving this film a 1/10 or 2/10 and im like thinking if thats the case what would you rate B lister or C Lister movies lol?

Seen another comment complain the CGI is trash when the CGI is totally in line with the rest of rhe Transformers movies and also of very high quality, trash CGI would be one of those $10k -50k budget movies, not a Transformer film, if u wnat trash CGI go watch the copycat film called TransMorphs lol

I think alot of people are just mad their was no white character in sight and thats okay considering many of the movies was largely all about white characters so why cry about it? Literally 1 guy in the review said its trash that they include racial equality agenda in this film and how they ruined the movie for fans to make it racially motivated but lets be real here people, the only people making this film racially problematic is you people bringing it up. Maybe to the writers & Director they didnt even think about race when filming this movie and instead just looked for people suitable for the roles but guess who makes it about race?

The people crying theirs no white people.

Some people also complained that cause the main human characters were minorities & not White that it is pushing a Woke Agenda? So then if the characters were just white you wouldnt be crying its a white supremacist agenda would you?

Or maybe they just angry that theirs no hot chicks in the film? Who knows

Personally I rather see a hot asian or white chick as lead actress then the current actress but either way it didnt affect my viewing experience at all. People forget this is a Transformers film, who cares if the human characters involved can carry the franchise or not? Who says they will be in the next film? Literally all fans have come to watch this film for Transformers, not the human characters. I feel people are totally nitpicking for something to complain just cause they are so mad its a Non-White movie lol

Maybe some people forget America isnt just a White country, theirs other minority ethnicities too & Im sure even if they had added abunch of white minor characters that these people would still be downvoting the movie n crying.

Lets not het it twisted, yall aint mad that their wasnt no White characters in this film, u are totally mad that the main characters are not white. Another reviewer claimed hes tired of the Transformers taking the front n center in the story plots but its .. a Transformers Movie!! Duh!!

570,570,1.0,"Jul 14, 2023","I've seen the first Transformers film, and this one is more of my speed. It's the year I was in my early 20's, but I remember the area of New York very well. Enough that, let's get to the point. The Autobots are on Earth, and Mirage is disguised as a Porsche. Optimus Prime is back as the rig I remember.

Now there is another faction: The Maximals. Leader of the group is Optimus Primal: The Gorilla. He looked like a robotic version of King Kong. He was a true leader and accepted Earth as home. Finding human beings who want to help wasn't easy for the Autobot Prime, but looking back let's him rethink what it was when Kawiki helped him.

This movie is totally badass! It's got a lot of humor, a lot of action, and a lot of heart. This Prime was pumped up in the middle of the film. He did not hold back in the battle! I don't care about the negative remarks about the film. I'm a diehard Transformers fan. The Beast Wars is small, but they are important to the franchise.

They should have animated the film. I do remember the 1986 movie when I was angered when they killed off my favorite Autobots. This one help me forget that. I enjoyed it to the MAX!!

572,572,10.0,"Jul 22, 2023","The seventh installment of the Transformers live action saga uses the same formula as the previous installment and is to bring a new recreation of the animated history that marked the childhood of many. In this case, it also chooses to bring back the Beast Wars characters, although only the most relevant Maximals are the ones they include. Instead of the Predacons, the Terrorcons are the main villains. The film adapts those characters in the style of Michael Bay that is still present in the saga, but it is a wonderful roller coaster of action and special effects that generates excitement and even revives old memories of the Transformers G1 and Beast Wars series. Unicron in this movie even has the air of that version seen in the 80s animated movie. Everything in this movie is great, including the plot, the direction, and it has very good shots of Peruvian lands.

573,573,3.0,"Jun 11, 2023","IN A NUTSHELL: Steven Caple Jr. Directs this 7th addition to the Transformers franchise. Writing credits go to Joby Harold, Darnell Metayer, Josh Peters, Erich Hoeber, and Jon Hoeber.

During the '90s, a new faction of Transformers - the Maximals - join the Autobots as allies in the battle for Earth.

THINGS I LIKED: The cast is fantastic and includes Anthony Ramos (I love him!), Ron Perlman (voice), Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh (voice), Pete Davidson (voice), Dominique Fishback, and young Dean Scott Vazquez.

The lead characters' stories immediately make you want to root for them. The emotional connection between the Transformers is also significant.

You get action from the very first scene and plenty more later on.

Impressive set pieces.

Lots of humor. Not all of it lands, but I appreciated the effort.

Poppin music.

We get to go to Peru! The luscious, green landscapes mixed with terraced stones and wide fields make for the perfect backdrop and setting for more battle sequences. Throw in a little bit of Inca legend, and you've got something interesting.

If you've ever seen the TV series ""Beast Wars: Transformers (1996), then you'll recognize the Maximals, which can transform into animals.

Optimus Prime is a 1987 Freightliner FLA semi-truck in this movie.

There are some entertaining, new robots that are immediately likeable.

Shout-out to New York City grit.

Compared to the Michael Bay movies that had dizzying, grinding action sequences that were too close-up to see well, I thought the direction of this film was much better. The last few Transformer movies were real stinkers, but this one worked, cliched as it was.

The CGI is very good.

We let a LOT of different kinds of Transformers.

The ending lets you know you're not going to have to wait too long for a sequel to this story. Yep, the Transformers franchise is not dead.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: Because they have to keep reinventing worlds, there is, necessarily, a LOT of exposition so the audience can understand what's going on. So much explaining!

It always makes me laugh when the Transformers have massive battles out in the open, yet no other humans see or hear anything.

The plot is extremely simple, sandwiched by lots of battles and destruction.

Some of the story details are filled with predictable tropes and others don't make sense but try not to overthink everything and you'll enjoy it just fine.

If you don't like Transformer movies to begin with, don't bother with this one. Some fans are loving this new addition, but it's probably not going to convince you otherwise.

There's a short scene when Dominique Fishback starts to sing and I was REALLY hoping that Anthony Ramos would sing with her, but he doesn't. Missed opportunity! I absolutely loved him in Hamilton and In the Heights. He is so talented!

First, Optimus Prime. Now, Optimus Primal. Seriously?

It felt a lot like the very first Transformers movie but without the novelty.

TIPS FOR PARENTS: A mother swears and her son scolds her saying, ""Language!"" There is some additional, ""mild"" profanity.

Some Spanish is spoken without subtitles. One line is crude.

Lots of destruction.

Lots of violence and fighting.

People and creatures are in dangerous situations.

A boy has Sickle Cell.

Steven Caple Jr did an amazing job directing this movie, and you can tell that he put his heart and soul into making this movie entertaining for its viewers.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is giving Transformers fans exactly what we've been wanting for YEARS! A refreshing new take on the Transformers story with likable human characters and an intense, action packed plot, with fun Transformers that bring on the comedy! The Transformers franchise has been lacking heart and soul for a while now and this movie gives us that! ROTB is a great mix of action, comedy, great sound design and heart. It is everything I have ever wanted in a Transformers movie!

Mirage and Noah are an iconic duo that really changed the game. Their interactions were so enjoyable to watch and they gave Bumblebee a chance to take a step back while his fellow teammate formed a strong bond with a human. It's nice to see other Autobots become friends with humans for a change. Mirage is such a likable, wholesome, funny character that reminds us that some of our best friends can come from the most unexpected places.

While critics might leave reasonable criticisms (and some others stupid remarks), the movie is extremely fun and actually makes you care about the characters. The humans are relatable, and some scenes hit hard emotionally, while some others gave me goosebumps.

I suggest going in the theater without being too critical of anything, and just really in the mood for a fun summer blockbuster.

Particularly, the fight between Autobots and Decepticons which is exhausting at this point. However, this movie provided a VERY fresh take on the story and characters. The long-awaited appearance of Unicron in live-action and a bunch of enemies not named Megatron and was a Decepticon is refreshing. On top of that, Optimus' anger towards Unicron and his lackeys is the most justifiable reason for Optimus to kill since these guys are incapable of remorse, guilt, and humanity. Connecting us to he human aspect of this film was fantastic as well and it was long-awaited in a sense since the departure of Shia LaBeouf's character, Sam Witwicky.

The characters are far more relatable than past movies. Noah is a struggling vet trying to make ends meet and Elana is an unrecognized intern.

Mirage (Pete Davidson) is a great centerpiece as a Transformer. The Beast are there but not overused. There are a few silly macguffins to keep the story going.

I never understand why people like Dinklage, Yeoh or Ron Pearlman do a movie like this but Dinklage and Yeoh are perfectly fine. This is not a Michael Bay film and that helps too.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",i never thought id be pushing for people to watch a transformers movie it has a great backdrop the s being a kid of thr s its represented pretty well with fantastic music and solid callback the characters are far more relatable than past movies noah is a struggling vet trying to make ends meet and elana is an unrecognized intern mirage pete davidson is a great centerpiece as a transformer the beast are there but not overused there are a few silly macguffins to keep the story going i never understand why people like dinklage yeoh or ron pearlman do a movie like this but dinklage and yeoh are perfectly fine this is not a michael bay film and that helps too,POSITIVE

This is a fantasy movie so those of you trying to connect all the dots, you are missing the beauty of this movie. The special effects were great. The effects were slower, allowing you to witness the transformations. The earlier series effects were too fast.

The beginning is really slow. It shows the beginning of before Optimus and the others are who we saw in the first of the series and how they grew. However as the movie continues it's very well done. The fact it revolves around just two main characters and technically 3.

If you're expecting a lot of human vs robot action, this isn't it. And that's not a bad thing. Yes it was toned down from what we're used to seeing. But again it's more of a story than just packed action.

It will be interesting to see the next one. They left the ending open to a great series.

This movie breathes an extraordinary breath of fresh air into the Transformers series. The Michael Bay movies have always been a debatable subject from their overall plot, consistency and the poorly executed design choices. After the success of Bumblebee for fixing these flaws, this movie being a continutation of that could be the beginning of a retcon fans have been asking for. The designs in Rise of the Beasts pay homage to the roots of Transformers, packed with action and a story that reels in viewers. All this is topped with an outstanding soundtrack that makes this experience all the more exciting. Whilst the dialogue and jokes have their moments of corniness, as expected due to it's target audience, it's great for all viewers and a brilliant family movie for the summer.

614,614,3.0,"Jul 11, 2023","I watched this movie last year and I liked it a lot, but I also instantly forgot about it and that's mostly because I was tired of the live-action Transformers movies. So, I decided to give the movie a fresh rewatch to see if my opinions changed and I can happily say that I enjoyed this movie a lot more than my initial viewing experience.

Positives for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023): Similar to Bumblebee (2018), this movie actually made me care about the human characters and the drama that's going on in their lives. Anthony Ramos and Dominique Fishback give great performances as Noah Diaz and Elena Wallace respectively. I still enjoyed Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and I appreciate that this movie makes him question the humans and their values. I really enjoyed Pete Davidson as Mirage especially since I'm not that big of a fan of Pete Davidson. He manages to get some good laughs from me and his dynamic with Noah in this movie was very good. Ron Perlman and Michelle Yeoh were amazing as Optimus Primal and Airazor respectively especially since I'm still very new to these Maximals characters. Peter Dinklage as Scourge was a fantastic villain and it was nice to see our heroes fighting an antagonist outside of Megatron. The action sequences in this movie were fantastic and you can see everything that is happening on screen just like in Bumblebee (2018). And finally, the way how this movie ends and is being teased for the future has me excited for this franchise again and I couldn't be happier about that.

Negatives for Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023): The movie's premise is very similar to the one from Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009). Thankfully, the execution of that premise is much better in this movie.

Overall, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) is my second favorite live-action Transformers movie and I can't wait to watch Transformers One (2024) later on this month.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",i watched this movie last year and i liked it a lot but i also instantly forgot about it and thats mostly because i was tired of the liveaction transformers movies so i decided to give the movie a fresh rewatch to see if my opinions changed and i can happily say that i enjoyed this movie a lot more than my initial viewing experience positives for transformers rise of the beasts similar to bumblebee this movie actually made me care about the human characters and the drama thats going on in their lives anthony ramos and dominique fishback give great performances as noah diaz and elena wallace respectively i still enjoyed peter cullen as optimus prime and i appreciate that this movie makes him question the humans and their values i really enjoyed pete davidson as mirage especially since im not that big of a fan of pete davidson he manages to get some good laughs from me and his dynamic with noah in this movie was very good ron perlman and michelle yeoh were amazing as optimus primal and airazor respectively especially since im still very new to these maximals characters peter dinklage as scourge was a fantastic villain and it was nice to see our heroes fighting an antagonist outside of megatron the action sequences in this movie were fantastic and you can see everything that is happening on screen just like in bumblebee and finally the way how this movie ends and is being teased for the future has me excited for this franchise again and i couldnt be happier about that negatives for transformers rise of the beasts the movies premise is very similar to the one from transformers revenge of the fallen thankfully the execution of that premise is much better in this movie overall transformers rise of the beasts is my second favorite liveaction transformers movie and i cant wait to watch transformers one later on this month,POSITIVE
615,615,10.0,"Dec 6, 2023","This film was actually brilliant I thought they couldn't reach the level of bumblebee again and they proved me wrong. This is by far the best Transformers film made the writing and overall story is brilliant it really shows the villains and what the film is about in the first 5 minutes, it sets the plot straight away gives you and sense of urge already and prepares you for what the film is going for a why it's doing this. The villain Scourge is a real highlight in this film he's shown from the start how dangerous and how much of a menace he is, he's the best villian in a live action transformers film, he's scary and menacing and has a real threat to him. The main hero Noah is greatly presented and he's got a real reason for helping these transformers on there mission he's got a sad life he's trying to provide for his family and he gets tossed into this other world. Mirage is one of if not the best character in this film he's so likeable, he's funny, charismatic and has a real heart he's there to protect his new friend now Noah no matter what, and there relationship really shines thought the film. The only problem with this film is the female hero who's just a talking dictionary in this film she's only there to provide her knowledge. Optimus Prime actually has a character arc in this film, he starts of by not liking or caring about the humans he was only in earth to save his planet from unicron he didn't care what happened to earth then through this film he sees that other autobots can trust the humans and it shows prime that it's about saving both planets and he learns over time to trust the humans and he then knows he must save them to. And Last on this review is the over visuals and cgi of these characters are brilliant the fight scenes are no longer just massive explosions and not giant sceptical you can actually understand and see who's fighting who the fights feel more real.

It has a good number of faults, but also many qualities.

I didn't know Anthony Ramos and was pleasantly surprised. Dominique Fishback also did a good enough job.

Learning that Pete Davidson voices Mirage was pretty cool; the character is among the highlights of the movie.

It is action packed, during every scene you would be at the edge of your seat. The comedy is subtle and hilarious, the stakes where high, the humans were relatable and important to the plot, it was very emotional and heart wrenching and it was very nostalgic and it reminded me of the original transformers movie from 1986.

The disappointing thing is that most of the critics who watched this movie don't even know what transformers is, which is why the movie has received low scores on other review platforms

622,622,3.0,"Jul 18, 2023","For many fans of the Transformers film franchise, the journey through the series has been a rollercoaster of emotions. From the initial excitement of seeing these iconic robotic beings brought to life on the big screen to the disappointment of lackluster sequels, it's been a mixed bag. However, ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" brought renewed hope and enthusiasm to the hearts of fans, offering a refreshing take on the beloved robotic warriors.

The journey through the Transformers film series has been far from smooth. ""Age of Extinction"" left many fans disillusioned, ""The Last Knight"" was met with considerable disdain, and even ""Bumblebee,"" which attempted to reboot the series, didn't resonate with everyone. Thus, expectations were understandably low as fans approached the latest installment. But, to the delight of many, ""Rise of the Beasts"" exceeded those expectations, reminding us why Transformers have been an integral part of pop culture for decades.

From the very beginning of the film, it's evident that something is different. The atmosphere feels fresh, and there's a sense of nostalgia combined with a modern twist. The CGI, which has always been a hallmark of the franchise, is taken to new heights. The Transformers themselves are beautifully rendered, showcasing intricate details and dynamic transformations that make them feel like living, breathing characters.

One of the standout features of ""Rise of the Beasts"" is the improved action sequences. In previous films, the action often felt chaotic and hard to follow. However, this time around, it's clear and visually stunning. The choreography of the battles between Autobots and Decepticons is not only a treat for the eyes but also evokes a sense of awe and excitement that fans haven't experienced in a while. Moments that capture the essence of why Transformers are ""so damn cool"" are plentiful, and fans will find themselves grinning from ear to ear.

Where the previous films fell short, ""Rise of the Beasts"" makes significant strides. Characters are more than mere plot devices. They have motivations and conflicts that the audience can relate to and empathize with. This isn't just about Autobots versus Decepticons; it's about the humans who are entangled in their world, and the film takes the time to develop these characters and their relationships.

Even the Transformers themselves are given more depth. They're not just giant robots battling for supremacy; they have their own struggles, emotions, and pasts. As a result, the audience can genuinely connect with them and feel for their trials and triumphs.

One of the most significant improvements is the presence of a coherent and engaging storyline. ""Rise of the Beasts"" doesn't rely on nonsensical plot devices to move the story forward. Instead, there's a well-thought-out narrative that keeps viewers invested from start to finish. No longer do you have to ""turn your brain off"" to enjoy a Transformers film; this one invites you to engage with the story and characters on a deeper level.

And then there's the humor, a facet that has often fallen flat in previous Transformers movies. In ""Rise of the Beasts,"" the comedy actually works. The well-timed humor not only provides moments of levity but also enhances the overall viewing experience. It's refreshing to laugh genuinely during a Transformers film, and this movie delivers on that front.

As one thrilled fan put it, ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is the best Transformers movie since ""Dark of the Moon."" The optimism and excitement about the franchise's future are palpable. After experiencing this film, it's hard not to look forward to what comes next. If this is the direction they're taking, where care and passion go into every detail, then the result will undoubtedly be endlessly better.

In an edit to the original review, the fan expressed how their appreciation for the film grew on a second viewing. Multiple action sequences still managed to give them goosebumps, akin to the iconic moments from ""Dark of the Moon."" Additionally, the musical score, an aspect that often goes unsung, was highlighted for its amazing ability to elevate every scene and evoke strong emotions in the audience.

""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" has reinvigorated the franchise, reigniting the passion and love that fans have always had for these iconic robots in disguise. It stands as a testament to what's possible when a beloved franchise is handled with care and dedication, resulting in a cinematic experience that leaves fans ecstatic and eager for more.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",for many fans of the transformers film franchise the journey through the series has been a rollercoaster of emotions from the initial excitement of seeing these iconic robotic beings brought to life on the big screen to the disappointment of lackluster sequels its been a mixed bag however transformers rise of the beasts brought renewed hope and enthusiasm to the hearts of fans offering a refreshing take on the beloved robotic warriors the journey through the transformers film series has been far from smooth age of extinction left many fans disillusioned the last knight was met with considerable disdain and even bumblebee which attempted to reboot the series didnt resonate with everyone thus expectations were understandably low as fans approached the latest installment but to the delight of many rise of the beasts exceeded those expectations reminding us why transformers have been an integral part of pop culture for decades from the very beginning of the film its evident that something is different the atmosphere feels fresh and theres a sense of nostalgia combined with a modern twist the cgi which has always been a hallmark of the franchise is taken to new heights the transformers themselves are beautifully rendered showcasing intricate details and dynamic transformations that make them feel like living breathing characters one of the standout features of rise of the beasts is the improved action sequences in previous films the action often felt chaotic and hard to follow however this time around its clear and visually stunning the choreography of the battles between autobots and decepticons is not only a treat for the eyes but also evokes a sense of awe and excitement that fans havent experienced in a while moments that capture the essence of why transformers are so damn cool are plentiful and fans will find themselves grinning from ear to ear where the previous films fell short rise of the beasts makes significant strides characters are more than mere plot devices they have motivations and conflicts that the audience can relate to and empathize with this isnt just about autobots versus decepticons its about the humans who are entangled in their world and the film takes the time to develop these characters and their relationships even the transformers themselves are given more depth theyre not just giant robots battling for supremacy they have their own struggles emotions and pasts as a result the audience can genuinely connect with them and feel for their trials and triumphs one of the most significant improvements is the presence of a coherent and engaging storyline rise of the beasts doesnt rely on nonsensical plot devices to move the story forward instead theres a wellthoughtout narrative that keeps viewers invested from start to finish no longer do you have to turn your brain off to enjoy a transformers film this one invites you to engage with the story and characters on a deeper level and then theres the humor a facet that has often fallen flat in previous transformers movies in rise of the beasts the comedy actually works the welltimed humor not only provides moments of levity but also enhances the overall viewing experience its refreshing to laugh genuinely during a transformers film and this movie delivers on that front as one thrilled fan put it transformers rise of the beasts is the best transformers movie since dark of the moon the optimism and excitement about the franchises future are palpable after experiencing this film its hard not to look forward to what comes next if this is the direction theyre taking where care and passion go into every detail then the result will undoubtedly be endlessly better in an edit to the original review the fan expressed how their appreciation for the film grew on a second viewing multiple action sequences still managed to give them goosebumps akin to the iconic moments from dark of the moon additionally the musical score an aspect that often goes unsung was highlighted for its amazing ability to elevate every scene and evoke strong emotions in the audience transformers rise of the beasts has reinvigorated the franchise reigniting the passion and love that fans have always had for these iconic robots in disguise it stands as a testament to whats possible when a beloved franchise is handled with care and dedication resulting in a cinematic experience that leaves fans ecstatic and eager for more,POSITIVE

624,624,4.0,"Jun 11, 2023","I want to note what I'm seeing in this review. This was a movie crafted with care, by the director, the CGI crew, the sound crew, the camera crew, there are many moments that you can tell were done to stay true to the characters, comic, and content. And that's worth mentioning these days.

Bumblebee, who they could have completely let fall back with the sheer amount of characters included, had his moments.

In keeping with the last film, they continued him gloriously into this film. Right up to Optimus chiding him to stop going to drive-throughs when he started backtalking him. The few things Bumblebee voiced at all, were all well placed with great timing to great story effect, comedy or drama.

It's especially worth noting that when you have two scene stealers like Bumblebee and Mirage (Davidson), aside from introducing an entirely new crew of bots to the screen, they were clever to balance the timing to give each their screen time and moments in the movie. This was smart, and gave each their time without taking from the other, or the rest of the (many) characters.

I think it's important to stop and appreciate that it's a first time Transformers director, relatively young, (Bay exec'd) including two separate groups of classic bots in the Autobots, and first time Maximals, but also including the Predacons, and the new Terracons. This is in one movie, in 2 hours, with relatively unknown human character leads. And it is doing extremely well in the box office U. S. and abroad.

The Maximals are true to form. Anyone who watched Beast Wars will note they did it well. Even when they changed the voice actor for Optimus Primal, the tone when he told Cheetor and Rhinox to maximize, you know he went back, watched Beast Wars, and read up on the character. This is missing from soo many movies. Cheetor's agility, Rhinox's force, Primal's rapid strategy and coordination in the moment, it's all there. They knew what they were doing. And most movies these days do not, lets be honest.

The action scenes were stellar. Coherent, you could see what was going on. Emotional. Your brain doesn't shut off while everything's blasting for 20 minutes. You're wondering what happens to the bots as you growing to like their adaptation on screen. The baddies have tricks up their sleeves, no empty monologuing, they get right to business.

Optimus is clearly stumbling into his role on this planet, and what he's doing here. He's dealing with regret, he doesn't trust humans, he fears for the safety of his people, and he's a jerk about it. But he's made more real from it. In the final battles you can see the change imprinted on him that leads to the later movies.

I could go on. But don't miss this one, because if your issue here is color the world is moving on. And in, and outside of America, they are speaking with their wallets very loudly.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",i want to note what im seeing in this review this was a movie crafted with care by the director the cgi crew the sound crew the camera crew there are many moments that you can tell were done to stay true to the characters comic and content and thats worth mentioning these days bumblebee who they could have completely let fall back with the sheer amount of characters included had his moments in keeping with the last film they continued him gloriously into this film right up to optimus chiding him to stop going to drivethroughs when he started backtalking him the few things bumblebee voiced at all were all well placed with great timing to great story effect comedy or drama its especially worth noting that when you have two scene stealers like bumblebee and mirage davidson aside from introducing an entirely new crew of bots to the screen they were clever to balance the timing to give each their screen time and moments in the movie this was smart and gave each their time without taking from the other or the rest of the many characters i think its important to stop and appreciate that its a first time transformers director relatively young bay execd including two separate groups of classic bots in the autobots and first time maximals but also including the predacons and the new terracons this is in one movie in hours with relatively unknown human character leads and it is doing extremely well in the box office u s and abroad the maximals are true to form anyone who watched beast wars will note they did it well even when they changed the voice actor for optimus primal the tone when he told cheetor and rhinox to maximize you know he went back watched beast wars and read up on the character this is missing from soo many movies cheetors agility rhinoxs force primals rapid strategy and coordination in the moment its all there they knew what they were doing and most movies these days do not lets be honest the action scenes were stellar coherent you could see what was going on emotional your brain doesnt shut off while everythings blasting for minutes youre wondering what happens to the bots as you growing to like their adaptation on screen the baddies have tricks up their sleeves no empty monologuing they get right to business optimus is clearly stumbling into his role on this planet and what hes doing here hes dealing with regret he doesnt trust humans he fears for the safety of his people and hes a jerk about it but hes made more real from it in the final battles you can see the change imprinted on him that leads to the later movies i could go on but dont miss this one because if your issue here is color the world is moving on and in and outside of america they are speaking with their wallets very loudly,POSITIVE

634,634,4.0,"Aug 27, 2023","I thought 2018's Bumblebee was a step in the right direction for the franchise on film and was happy to hear that Rise of the Beasts would be building from the events of that movie, and being someone who grew up in the 1990's finally getting the Maximals on the big screen had me very intrigued.

Rise of the Beasts is not on the same level as Bumblebee, but comes close to the same level as the very first Michael Bay helmed feature from 2007 and is still pretty solid entertainment. It isn't overly long, overly complicated, and the action set pieces are pretty energetic and exciting. This is most characters interaction between the Transformers that we have seen to date on film, and the voice acting talent do great with what they have to work with. The new human characters are fine and engaging, and there is plenty of heart to the film's story, where it comes short is the long set-up in the first act and the humor misses the mark once or twice.

I found myself smiling for most of the runtime. For the first time in years, I kept thinking ""Transformers are so damn cool."" There are so many beautiful shots with these CGI creations, so many moments to screenshot and frame. The action is miles better than the last three entries.

They fixed so many of the issues that plagued the last three movies. There are actual characters with motivations we understand, conflicts where we can see both sides of the argument. Even the Transformer characters are significantly more fleshed out. I felt for them.

There is an actual story instead of nonsense to move the plot forward. You don't even have to turn your brain off to enjoy it. And the comedy actually works! I laughed more times than the previous three movies combined.

This experience made me so happy, and I look forward to any future projects if this is the direction they're taking. It's a perfect example of how, if you do it right and create with care and passion, the result will be endlessly better.

EDIT: I loved it even more the second time. Multiple action sequences give me goosebumps, similar to how I feel when watching the Dark of the Moon highway scene and the Optimus rage scene at the end. And I can't believe I didn't mention it originally, but the musical score is AMAZING. It elevates every scene and gives me the feels.

650,650,4.0,"Jul 15, 2023","While this film isn't groundbreaking it gives fans of the franchise some hope of a resurgence. The film takes place in 1994 and it lends itself to that time period with the music choices and the aesthetics of New York. Anthony Ramos's character was that of a stereotypical Latino from New York. In the film he's down on his luck searching for a job to help his single mother take care of his ailing younger brother. While out trying to make money illegally he gets caught up with the transformers who are trying to retrieve an artifact.

Ramos is funny in his role and his chemistry with Pete Davidson (Mirage) works well. There was a point in the film where he took charge of the situation and it came off as a bit forced. Overall, I enjoyed his performance and what he added to this film. The direction of his character during the final battle added to the entertainment of this film.

Dominique Fishbacks's character started off interesting but by the time the film ended she was underwhelming. More could have been done with her character.

Dean Scott Vasquez was okay as he added a bit of humor but some of his scenes that were meant to be emotional weren't as touching as the film tried to make them.

The landscapes of Peru were very beautiful to see and it was nice seeing the action taken away from the city. The character designs were nice but some of the characters were underutilized (Cheetah, Rhino...). The beasts were shown here and there but it felt like a very surface level introduction.

651,651,8.0,"Aug 28, 2023","Transformers: Rise of the Beasts offers an exciting blend of action, nostalgia, and new characters that will engage both longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise. Directed by Steven Caple Jr. And set in the 1990s, the film introduces a fresh narrative revolving around the Maximals, Predacons, and the Autobots, which adds a unique twist to the beloved Transformer saga.

The visual effects are undoubtedly a highlight, with impressive CGI that brings the massive robots to life in spectacular battles. The action sequences are exhilarating, featuring dynamic choreography and breathtaking visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat. The vibrant settings, from urban landscapes to lush jungles, also contribute to the film's overall aesthetic appeal.

While the action and visuals shine, the plot feels somewhat formulaic. The story follows familiar patterns seen in previous Transformers films, and at times it lacks the depth and nuance needed to elevate it beyond a straightforward sci-fi action flick. Some character development falls by the wayside, leading to a few underwhelming performances.

That said, the chemistry between the human characters provides some heartfelt moments, and the humor scattered throughout the film adds levity to the intense action. The voice performances of the Transformers themselves, particularly those of the new characters, breathe life into the story and provide a sense of personality that fans will appreciate.

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is an entertaining rollercoaster that delivers what fans have come to expect - thrilling action and spectacular visuals.

This movie has all the hallmarks of the nowaday Transformer movie: worn out clichés, a horrendous script that might as well have been written by teenagers with zero character development, lazy attempts at humour, tired clichés, the fake patriotism, and explosions explosions explosions.

To top it off the creators have decided to broaden the market appeal by suddenly cast non-white actors and play what they seem to think is cool music. Sadly, I guess it could work but man, how lazy.

I guess it might work for teenage boys filled with testosterone, can't really se who else this is marketed to.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",after the last transformers movie i really didnt think these movies could get any dumber or that they would release even more of these but i guess i underestimated the allure of another cash grab this movie has all the hallmarks of the nowaday transformer movie worn out clichés a horrendous script that might as well have been written by teenagers with zero character development lazy attempts at humour tired clichés the fake patriotism and explosions explosions explosions to top it off the creators have decided to broaden the market appeal by suddenly cast nonwhite actors and play what they seem to think is cool music sadly i guess it could work but man how lazy i guess it might work for teenage boys filled with testosterone cant really se who else this is marketed to,NEGATIVE

The movie is not a masterpiece.....its not bad either...movie has a great flow starting to the end without making any brake points.... and there are no scenes where you can experience jumps from the main story like it was in Bayverse movies.... Movie has refreshed music with the all time classic Transformers Theme.... CGI was good...they have definitely done a great job....though they were not impressive like in the Bayverse...they could definitely improve transformations a little in some scenes but overall it is good.

I recommend watching this movie as this could be a game changing start for Transformers franchise.

654,654,2.0,"Jul 15, 2023","Good lord, after watching this film my IQ has been lowered by 10%... Starting out with the mish mash of 90's hip hop tunes that don't really work in the film, and then later the film forgets about the hip-hop and reverts to standard orchestral music.

The white male boss who doesn't want to give the Latino a job. And then Mirage the autobot mercilessly killing white cops in the car chase.

Then the Spanish transformer, and the Latino character is like ""Wow your spanish"" and the Spanish transformer replies ""That's racist..."" like omg... what is wrong with these writers?

And the two human hero's go into a tomb and they say: ""This is some indiana jones stuff"" and it just reads like the writers thought ""Lets have an indiana jones style section"" and then they comment on their own ideas in the script. So 4th wall breaking, but NOT in a good way.

At this point, I think a large section of Hollywood is just a rich club of nepo-babies without a single shred of talent, who are totally obsessed with shoving modern politics into everything. Like seriously, get some original ideas, and get a life. ( and I'm saying that as a Left Wing guy - but what do these issues have to do with Transformers??? )

No thank you.

656,656,3.0,"Jun 10, 2023","A film similar to the previous ones with some improvements, but fundamental is nothing really interesting. The story recalls other products, good visual effects and CGI, but this is not enough to save a film that follows the previous ones.

This is a brand that has now given everything, maybe it's time they put it to rest. A film you see once is enough, it's not a memorable film. To be watched without too many pretensions, it is not a bad film but it is not a good film. I liked Bubblebee the previous film before this one, this one much less. The premises are there to be a good product but they need to work more on the screenplay.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",a film similar to the previous ones with some improvements but fundamental is nothing really interesting the story recalls other products good visual effects and cgi but this is not enough to save a film that follows the previous ones this is a brand that has now given everything maybe its time they put it to rest a film you see once is enough its not a memorable film to be watched without too many pretensions it is not a bad film but it is not a good film i liked bubblebee the previous film before this one this one much less the premises are there to be a good product but they need to work more on the screenplay,NEGATIVE
657,657,3.0,"Jul 15, 2023","Honestly the last couple acts saved this movie. It went from a -1 to at least a 6. The classic Optimus/Peter Cullen came to fruition later in the film. I started feeling like a young kid again hearing Peter cullens trash talk and all was forgiven. Dare I say the film finished better than most transformer films to date.

The beasts: primal and crew, was awesome. One scene when he and Optimus prime teamed up, classic.

Dominique/Elena was good. She added a lot to the film.

Anthony/Noah was ok but his whole family background wasn't needed. The poor boy blah blah blah was tiresome and I found myself bored in the beginning.

Lastly, Pete. He's funny and all I get it. But with bumblebee getting a serious back seat, I wasn't happy.

But as I started this rant, the last hour or so was awesome. And it was a nice treat at the end, that definitely left me with anticipation for the future.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",honestly the last couple acts saved this movie it went from a to at least a the classic optimuspeter cullen came to fruition later in the film i started feeling like a young kid again hearing peter cullens trash talk and all was forgiven dare i say the film finished better than most transformer films to date the beasts primal and crew was awesome one scene when he and optimus prime teamed up classic dominiqueelena was good she added a lot to the film anthonynoah was ok but his whole family background wasnt needed the poor boy blah blah blah was tiresome and i found myself bored in the beginning lastly pete hes funny and all i get it but with bumblebee getting a serious back seat i wasnt happy but as i started this rant the last hour or so was awesome and it was a nice treat at the end that definitely left me with anticipation for the future,POSITIVE
658,658,4.0,"Jul 15, 2023","""Rise of the beasts"" but doesn't feel like a beasts was rising. 5 years of waiting a new Transformers film after Bumblebee (2018), I was expecting some Optimus Prime solo film or maybe some decent Transformers film but what we got is some mixed up faction betwen Autobots, Maximals and Terrorcons.

The problem with this film is that they introduce some of new characters but they force it into 1 hours film which is a mistake, this film should've been a 2 hours because there were new characters that we've never seen before in live action and they need some backstory about this new charactes. They only focus with the backstory about the humans which is boring because they got more screentime than the Maximals and i feel dissappointed with Rhinox and Cheetor, they have less screentime.

The transformation of robots in this film was kinda boring. In the bayverse the transformation of the Transformers feels like a slow but fast and smooth and we can see clearly how do they transform into robots. In this film the transformation was kinda fast and the CGI was kinda greyish so it's very hard to see what they transform into.

And oh god what have they done with Wheeljack. Wheeljack is such a useless character in this film. This film can work without Wheeljack. They change his design, his voice, his personality and worstly he doesn't even do anything in this film beside chasing Battletrap with Arcee.

Unicron? They should just make a movie about Autobots fighting The Decepticons because they really have a balls of steel to use Unicron in the first film Transformers in the reboot universe. I mean come on man this was a second film in the reboot universe and they just straight introduce us to Unicron. They should just do with Unicron later because this universe need more fresh story. It feels like a DCEU film when we got to introduce with Superman and then he fight Batman in the next film and then in the next film they introduce Darkseid.

The only things i like about this film is the soundtrack. Steve Jablonsky is back and he use his original Transformers 2007 theme in this film and i was surprise at the end of the film and Optimus Prime did his final speech after 6 years the last time he did his final speech in Transformers The Last Knight.

Rise of the beasts is pretty thin on story but there's just enough to hold interest and having the Gen 1 designs make a comeback is a nice addition, despite my lack of nostalgia for them.

I honestly don't know what to say beyond that, perfectly serviceable action movie with giant robots. Would have been nice to see a bit more of Unicron and a bit more development / depth to Scourge but hey, I grew up watching Transformers: Beast Wars and this delivers on that, all your favourites from the series, in one big brawl for the planet. 7/10.","June 9, 2023 (United States)",solid here and far better than the last few offerings although admittedly i lasted exactly minutes in the last knight before turning it off rise of the beasts is pretty thin on story but theres just enough to hold interest and having the gen designs make a comeback is a nice addition despite my lack of nostalgia for them i honestly dont know what to say beyond that perfectly serviceable action movie with giant robots would have been nice to see a bit more of unicron and a bit more development depth to scourge but hey i grew up watching transformers beast wars and this delivers on that all your favourites from the series in one big brawl for the planet,POSITIVE
