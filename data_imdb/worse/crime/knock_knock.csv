5.0,3 June 2021,"Directed by Eli Roth, Knock Knock is nothing other than a horrible home invasion story of torture and vandalism. It's enough to enrage all audiences and we demand a revenge sequel immediately! Keanu Reeves stars in the film as a hopeless victim of infuriating torture to leave you unsatisfied and angry at an extreme level. But what is good about the movie?

The fact that it's engaging enough to drag you out and supply you with horrible feelings is indeed fairly powerful, but Knock Knock would only be likeable if justice was included. Seriously, a sequel of justice and revenge is needed for the audiences without a single question. So unless you're feeling ready to spend 98 minutes watching an innocent man's life being ruined, simply avoid this one.

Although the power of this movie is appreciable, it's really unfair power. Knock Knock isn't at all a pleasurable movie, and due to the sympathy we'll have for the target of the torment, it's best left avoided for audiences entering the story already feeling angry.

1.0,4 November 2020,I can't believe Keanu made this movie and I doubly can't believe this script got the green light. I watched this for free and I want a refund.

1.0,7 October 2020,"I'm a Keanu Reeves fan and I like that he mixes up the types of movies he is involved with but this film is a disaster.

The girls are sexy and enticing (as their characters demand) but as good as Reeves is he can't convincingly do awkward.

And plausibility doesn't seem to be particularly important with this project.

Eli Roth...you just need to stop!

The film is predictable and disappointing.

Save your time."
7.0,12 September 2017,"I pretty much never leave a review for a movie.

I also pretty much never stop a movie or book before I finish it.

This movie was so bad that both happened. It's complete trash. The characters are unbelievable, the situation is absurd, and the acting leaves a lot to be desired. It's incredibly slow and there's basically no story or reason to be invested.

Avoid."

7.0,20 December 2015,"I'm a rare poster here at IMDb. Good movies? They get enough praise without me joining in the chorus. Average films? There's usually enough people on each side to adequately debate the pros and cons. But a film this ridiculously bad has, if nothing else, crossed whichever threshold is required to motivate me to reset my long forgotten IMDb login details and hopefully save some poor souls the 90 odd minutes of their lives, and (god forbid) their hard earned on a ticket.

It's so hard to know where to begin, so, as a wiser person than me once suggested, I will begin at the beginning. The acting, from the get go, is so wooden, unbelievable and shallow that not only did I not feel any connection to the characters, they were actually making me angry! Keanu is has always been pretty one dimensional, but he takes it to a new level with his performance here. In this role as a supposedly doting father, it felt like he has never spent more than five minutes around any kid. The wife was equally unconvincing and the kids were so bad they wouldn't get a role on a home-brand cola commercial. I did however quite like the Boston Terrier playing the role of the family pet, 'Monkey', and I feel like he did his best to carry this stinker, but with limited screen time there was only so much he could do.

Enter the 2 mysterious young women...who continue what has become the well established, by now 20 minute old tradition of corny, unconvincing Knock Knock performances.

The direction is lousy. I'm no film buff, but I watch enough of them. When I saw Eli Roth was the director in the opening credits, I said to my wife 'I think he has done some cool stuff'. Half way through this stinker I looked him up, and realised that, no...no he hasn't done anything even remotely decent in his entire career. A bit of shock horror in Hostel, a tenuous claim to fame at best, and then nothing. And his lack of talent is glaringly obvious here. I think I had confused him with a hybrid of Tim Roth and possibly Elijah Wood? I dunno...but Eli Roth shall forever more be the huge red flag he rightly is.

The story...let's call it a ""story"" for the sake of this review anyway. There's so much that could be said, so I'll simply say that it sucked in ways that few things have ever sucked before. It pioneers new ways to suck that modern scientific research in sucking are yet to even discover.

And the final cherry on this s#!t cake, was, after breaking my spirit and will to live, to break my heart to. Using the Pixies classic Where is My Mind as the closing track. Which the Pixies must have authorise...which defies comprehension. They made great money off their last tours, and allowed it to be used to close that all time classic Fight Club.

And so ends my review of this diabolically bad film. If I save one person the price of a ticket, or an hour an a half of their precious existence, it'll have all been worth it."
1.0,5 July 2023,"Plot In a Nutshell: A family man (Keanu Reeves) gives shelter to two seemingly lost young women caught in a rainstorm, realizing too late they are not as innocent and helpless as they first seemed.

Why I rated it a '7': This movie will likely get under your skin. It might even aggravate you. But boy is it effective in doing that, and so credit must be given.

As mentioned, the family man (Reeves) finds himself in way over his head when two pretty young things come knocking. He tries to hold his own but is soon overwhelmed by their aggressive sexual talk and behavior, as probably 99% of guys would be. When he finally makes a stand and it seems his ordeal is over, we learn it's really just beginning.

What makes the film effective is that most of what we see seems believable. We don't know why the girls are acting this way, but we don't have to know. Why did that dude go shoot up the school in Uvalde? Who the heck knows? But we know he did it. People do evil things all of the time. This is life. This is reality. Life is not a fairy tale.

I see several comments on here complaining about the ending. They wanted Reeves to ""get justice."" Well, again, this is reality. Good does not always win over evil. Things do not always end ""happily ever after."" Sorry. In real life, sometimes the bad guy does win. Deal with it. If you want fairy tale endings, then go back to watching Disney films, and leave adult films for the adults lol.

P. S. Getting real tired of reading reviews where someone writes ""this is the worst movie ever."" That is pretty much the most pathetic, exaggerated, unimaginative comment you could make. Do better."
8.0,21 September 2019,
7.0,2 June 2018,"Simple film with eerie, Eli-Roth-like-atmosphere. Storyline: 2 young beautiful ladies appear in the front door of settled-down Keanu and then...

As a viewer, you already know where this is going after 15-20 minutes.

Pass the half hour mark and then the movie accelerates with some very creepy and funny moments.

I think that if another actor would have been casted instead, maybe the element of humor would have been absent, so you might enjoy seeing Keanu Reeves reacting in adverse situations.

Pros: unpredictability, good shots, good atmosphere overall and subtle comical moments.

Cons: pace slow at times, dialogue in the beginning seems a bit discouraging but it gets better later on.

Worth the time, 8/10."
4.0,15 February 2024,"Listen, you either get his movie style or you don't. Reviewers here are taking this movie way too serious. This movie reminds me of when a group of friends got together and watched Scream, or Slither or any movie of that nature. It's fun, it's over the top, it's a dark comedy. At this point I think actors feel it's an honor and kind of like fad to be featured in his films. There are scenes/dialogues here that are just pure genius and can be discussed and quoted with friends just for grins. Keep up the this kind of movie style Mr. Roth, and I'll surely keep watching. It's definitely a breath of fresh air."
2.0,27 March 2021,"Set on Fathers' Day weekend, successful architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) prepares for a weekend of work while his wife and kids enjoy a weekend at the beach. On his first night home during a rainstorm two young women Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) arrive at his doorstep asking for help. After he allows them in the two seduce Evan resulting in a threeway. After Evan's infidelity, the two reveal their true intentions wreaking havoc on Evan's home and life and subject Evan to increasingly intense psychological and physical tortures which may culminate in his death.

Directed by Eli Roth Knock Knock is an uncredited remake of 1977s Death Game (though the original director and stars are executive producers). Knock Knock hits all the beats from the original while also updating the premise with references to contemporary society and technology. I honestly didn't like Death Game when I saw it because I found the plot repetitive and the characters annoying, but I did give it props for being a well made attempt by an inexperienced director and having a chilling performance from Sondra Locke. Knock Knock is certainly more polished of a product in terms of film making in comparison to its more grind house level predecessor, but while the package has been glossed up the content is considerably lesser this time around.

The opening 40 minutes are easily the best part of Knock Knock as we establish Evan's sexual frustration and hectic family situation that build up to the seduction. It's honestly really well told and is much better here than it was in the original 1977 film where the wife and kids were basically non entities for much of the original film's runtime. The film is also well shot with great looking establishment shots of the house.

Unfortunately beneath the coat of polish that's been applied many elements have been downgraded in terms of quality despite a supposedly more experienced director, Roth, helming the remake of a film that was made by an amateur. Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but only if given the right material. Reeves in Knock Knock does have a fun brief shining moments such as scene midway through the movie where he's trying to rebuke the advances of the seducers, but it feels like the role was written with someone like Nicolas Cage in mind and they just shoehorned Reeves into the role because they couldn't get him. Reeves still sporting his John Wick doo just doesn't sell it as a workaday family man and doesn't sell a role that he just doesn't fit into.

Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo start off well enough as the seducers when they first arrive in the movie, but around the halfway point where they reveal their true intentions they become absolutely insufferable to listen to. Not only do they act like oversexed brats with middle school level vocabularies, they have this unearned sense of ""holier than thou"" moral superiority that makes them extra aggravating. While movies with killers with prideful moral superiority complexes can work, such as Kiefer Sutherland as The Voice in Phone Booth or Tobin Bell as The Jigsaw Killer in Saw, those movies at least had some level of self awareness that their killers were hypocritical scum doing ex post fact justifications of their actions. Knock Knock is more confused and feels like it muddled its intentions much like Nicolas Cage's Wicker Man remake where they replaced the Paganism/Christianity dynamic with a fundamentally confused masculinity/femininity dynamic. Roth tries to update the very 70s counterculture girls with updated equivalents for the digital age, but it comes off more as an excuse for Roth to amp up the annoyance of characters who were already pretty grating to begin with.

Knock Knock is Roth at his worst. While it's not as bad as his worst movie, Hostel Part II, by virtue of at least being unintentionally fascinating in some confusing choices it's still an unnecessary remake of a very flawed movie that is not approved upon save for technical details. It's not completely without merit thanks to some decent cinematography and brief moments of good acting, but if you have a choice between this and the original, stick with the original, for all its flaws it at least had the excuse of an inexperienced director."
1.0,12 October 2015,"I read through lots of the reviews, and thought these guys are being harsh, it can't possibly be that bad can it?.....well the answer is yes.

In brief, Keanu Reeves plays Evan, an architect and former DJ, seemingly with the perfect life, he's successful, he has a beautiful wife and two kids. On the morning of his birthday his family go off to the seaside leaving him alone. He's hard at work when he gets a knock at the door, two rain soaked teenage girls, claiming they're lost, looking for a family. Reluctantly he takes them in, they flirt with him, and end up seducing him and sleeping with him. Next morning they've trashed the kitchen, and refuse to leave, behaving rather oddly. The girls claim they were under 15, leaving him guilty of rape, he manages to kick them out. Not done with him they later break in and tie him up, and then the real torture starts (more so for the viewer then Keanu.)

There are times when the acting becomes rather woeful, the scene with the neighbour, is like something out of a budget horror movie, it was shambolic. The torture game show part too, just horrendous, I mean could he not have overpowered them?

Evan says the following 'I'm so f***ing stupid,' he wasn't wrong.

There aren't many good points unfortunately, I believe when they thought of this film, someone fantasised about breaking in and seducing Keanu, then made a bad film around the one concept. One of the main problems is that there isn't a single likable character in the film, who really cares what happens to any of them. It's a shame are there was lots of potential.

Fair play to Keanu, he's playing a character of 43, I had to google his age, playing this he was fifty, he doesn't even look 40. He's ageing very well, there i've found a positive.

The film flopped badly in the UK cinemas. The moral of the story is believe the reviews on IMDb!!"
1.0,17 November 2017,
7.0,20 April 2019,
1.0,23 December 2015,"There are already ...261 (!) reviews for this B (or maybe C?) movie that came out only 2 months ago and that means something, i think.

First of all this is a remake of the movie ""Death Game (1977)"" starring Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp. The 2 women are serving as producers in the 2015 version while Colleen Camp also stars in a minor role.

This is Camp-y movie (pun intended!) with a lot of torture horror and a couple (mild in my opinion) erotic scenes. The 2 main actresses Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas look crazy enough but Keanu Reeves's performance leave a lot to be desired. Maybe we have used to see him as a hero (from the Matrix to John Wick) and we cannot accept to watch him being lame and weak.

There is obviously a moral here, but the question ""who could resist"" is also strongly present.

As a movie it's OK and you might have some fun watching it, but if you can't stand movies where the ""hero"" does all the wrong moves maybe you should avoid it. The direction of photography is bright and that's a plus, but if you are a careful viewer you will find a lot of goofs including numerous continuity errors which could ruin some of the fun.

In the end you might want for the movie to last a couple of minutes more to see the outcome or even the true motives of what just happened...

Overall: Not as bad as most of the other 261 reviews might want you to believe. (Some of them compare Keanu Reeves's recent choices to those of Nicolas Cage, so they might be driven by some hate). See it if you want a light campy thriller for the evening."
7.0,9 January 2022,"The Good: When I first saw Knock Knock, I recognized it as being a very bad, if not fun and frankly, titillating movie. It was ""so stupid,"" and ridiculous that I couldn't help but find enjoyment from it. I still think this is the case: this movie is both intentionally and unintentionally funny. It has some awful dialog and questionable performances. There are a ton of logical issues (more on this later) that take away from it.

And yet, Knock Knock is fun as heck. Eli Roth knows how to direct a movie and the entire opening is a masterclass of efficient (if awkward) storytelling. When Bel and Genesis (dumb names, I agree) show up, the entire sequence is so well done. I love how gradually Evan (Keanu) loosens up and begins to realize the seduction taking place. I'm going to say out loud what most heterosexual men watching this probably thought: Armas and Izzo are incredibly sexy and do a fantastic job. At the climax (hehe) of the scene, we get an explosion of sex and lust that's good enough to go toe to toe with erotic thrillers of years before.

Frankly, Armas and Izzo (whom I thought were awful the first time I saw this thing) were actually pretty excellent. You can't really tell what they're deal is and they come off as completely unhinged, if not particularly scary. And yes, I cannot deny there's a bit of a sexy eye candy and a point or two for the nudity. Whatever, I'm a dude.

I think as a man, this movie really does speak to us in a different way. This isn't a movie to watch with your girlfriend or wife next to you, because let's be honest, uncomfortable questions arise. And, I think the film does a good job with the sexual politics: is Evan truly ""wrong"" here? Could anyone really resist this ""free pizza?"" (I think the movie kind of reveals its position on the question with this scene and the ending, btw) If no man can resist a moment of weakness when faced with temptation, are there truly any good men out there? I like thought provoking movies, and while this one is about as subtle as a sledgehammer, it's something to think about.

I also want to highlight Keanu Reeves here. Let's be honest: he's not a good actor. He seems like a fantastic human being, but there isn't going to be a ""get Keanu his Oscar"" campaign anytime soon. And while he's quite bad in portions of this movie, when he's campy, it's FANTASTIC. The aformentioned ""free pizza"" rant is possibly the best performance he's ever done. The end scene is so visually strange and complemented by his manic performance, that it had me in tears. This movie isn't meant to be taken all that seriously and if you can enjoy it on that level, it works.

The Bad: That isn't to say I can't understand why people flat out HATE this movie (more on that later). There are A LOT of logical inconsistencies here and unrealistic moments. Why would Evan believe the two of them are minors? Seriously? Where is everyone in this neighbourhood? You're telling me he can't overpower these two 100 lb girls? Really?

And, as much as I praised Izzo and Armas before, I can't deny they're masterful actors in isolation. Them, in combination with Reeves, create some truly hilarious moments of bad acting. Eli Roth isn't known for great dialog either and um...yes, that criticism stands.

The Ugly: Knock Knock is fun. It's a guilty pleasure, for sure, but I don't think the hate it gets is warranted. I suspect a lot of people dislike Eli Roth, for one, and American audiences tend to be very sex negative. A movie that explores psychosexuality, the male lust for young women, the morality of ""free pizza"" etc. Is not going to be a mainstream film.

But, I'd say give it a chance and I'm sure you'll be entertained. Just...maybe give it a pre-watch yourself before watching it with anyone else."
4.0,17 December 2015,
8.0,25 April 2021,"This was really suspensful and I kept hoping it would take a more favourable turn for the main character.

Sure Keanu acts like Bill and Ted but thats expected right?

Essences of Hard Candy but still enjoyable. The me too crowd will blame Keanu for his predicament and maybe so but all men are pigs, we get that, so why not show a little sympathy? The punishment should fit the crime. Intrigued? Give it a whirl if you enjoy Eli Roth direction."
7.0,19 November 2015,"Despite the warnings from negative reviews and low IMDb rating i watched it anyway... I've always liked Eli Roth mainly for his near show stealing appearance as 'The Bear Jew' in Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and his movies, though never groundbreaking for me, offered playful b-movie fun. His efforts here seemed to diminish after the initial creation of suspense. Once we move to the second act the script loses any credibility and little is left for creation of further suspense. It's almost as if the idea was to get Keanu to behave somewhat like Nicholas Cage in OMG mode. That idea i couldn't shake and ironically it became what kept me entertained, imagining cage instead of reeves, which wasn't too hard as Keanu seemed to channel the spirit of the rage cage as if he were possessed by him. Don't let my mention of cage fool you, the acting in this movie is sub par, if Keanu isn't The Wicker Man he's the wooden man and the girls act like female villains in a made for TV batman movie. In summary; I found a few things Keanu said in a serious monologue quite laugh out loud funny and the use of a popular pixies track at the end credits reminded me of a student movie using cool music to be cool. All it did was remind me of it's already iconic use in one of my favorite movies. The movie was just bad enough to enjoy it's shitness or i'd have not sat through it. Avoid this if you get offended by crap movies but I'm almost recommending you to watch this for the points I mentioned for your own curiosity. The movie stuck in my mind enough for m to waste time writing this review, i wonder if that was Roth's intention for the audience or he actually took this movie seriously."
1.0,17 September 2021,This movie is a very good in the genre of suspense. Nice act by Keanu Reeves loved it.
4.0,26 April 2016,
3.0,14 July 2019,"Please do not waste any time on this movie. The story line is in one word, disgusting. Awful. Despicable. Words cannot describe. It starts with a deceptive nice story and a character played by Mr. Keanu Reeves. And then soon everything goes to hell. Simply unacceptable. As much as I am a fan of Mr. Reeves, I believe he should not agree to do such films. The only reason he would do such a thing is to give a platform to the two girls in the movie. Still. On a sarcastic note, his unhinged rant by the end of the movie was hilarious. Eli Roth is crazy and this is not even horror. What is the genre, Cringe-worthy? Disaster."
4.0,27 April 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Architect Evan (Keanu Reeves) lives in a nice, swanky house with his wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and their two young boys. One weekend, Karen takes the boys away with her, leaving Evan on his own. He gets a surprise one night when two young women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door, claiming to have broken down and in need of a shower and a taxi. Initially pleasant, after luring Evan into a night of soaring passion, they then refuse to leave and subject him to a relentless, psychopathic barrage of violence and humiliation.

Playing like a variation on The Human Centipede set-up (and, by the end, astonishingly much more horrible than that film), despite not having much opening development between the main character and his loved ones, Knock Knock does manage to generate an interesting premise for the beginning. As soon as the girls arrive, knowing that things are going to take a sinister turn, it's intriguing to see just how this will play out and why. But after that, it just goes to pot and ends up leaving a really nasty taste in the mouth.

With elements of Phone Booth and Hard Candy chucked in to the plot, this skirts around the issue of young girls looking older than they are, and suckering older guys into going with them, an issue that's been playing in the media lately. But rather than using this as a plot device for some deep thought, it just degenerates into a relentlessly gratuitous and nasty piece of work, like a long winded, less grounded version of the superior British flick Cherry Tree Lane. Izzo and de Amis are a pair of seriously deranged, psychotic devil women, who just serve to distract from Reeves, who is as wooden as ever.

By the end, it's just started to become annoying and stupid, with only the theme from the end of Fight Club playing over the end credits to remind you of something better. You think of those two girls up the north of England who battered that woman to death in her house, and when you're expected to be entertained by something as dispiriting as this, it puts things in perspective. **"
7.0,13 July 2016,"Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is home alone after his happy family left for the weekend. He's trying to work when Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) knock on his door. They're lost and soaking wet. He calls Uber for them but the aggressive flirts have sex with him. As he tries to make them leave the next morning, they turn out to be less than stable.

The idea of hot crazy chicks as horror villains could be fun. Reeves is playing a relative douche which is hard to root for. The girls are not scary. Their characters border on being comical. They keep threatening as underage but they don't look underage. The first time I took as a comedic hollow threat but it's annoying when it keeps coming back. Eli Roth seems to be going for a different kind of horror. I would be a lot happier if Evan punch out the girls and chop them into pieces. This way is a lazy, silly 'Fatal Attraction'. The part with Louis gets too annoying. Everything is too broad, and too obvious. This is not scary nor thrilling. One could almost see this as camp."
1.0,18 July 2019,"Why on God's green earth what an actor, A class actor, like Keanu Reeves take this role?

Does he have financial difficulty we don't know about?

I could understand if this was one of his first roles and he was desperate. This was just so bad. The only thing worse than the movie was the ending.

The only decent thing about the movie was Keanu Reeves. Just terrible.

I wanted the two girls in the movie to die a slow and horrible death."

9.0,13 August 2017,"I like Keanu Reeves. He's starred in some of my favourite films (Bill and Ted, The Matrix, The Gift) and, by all accounts, he's a stand up bloke in real life. For those reasons, I'll cut him some slack for his godawful performance in Knock Knock. We all make mistakes.

Eli Roth, however, doesn't get off so lightly. He's the biggest hack working in the horror film industry today, his attempts at shock cinema are childish in the extreme, and his braggadocio is thoroughly annoying. Just once I wish he would back up his arrogance with something worthwhile, but, if anything, he gets worse with each film he makes.

The atrocious Knock Knock stars Reeves as Evan, a family man who is almost as perfect as the actor in real life: loving husband, doting father, and talented architect. One rainy night, while Evan is home alone hard at work (his wife and kids having gone to the beach for the weekend), there is a knock knock at the door; Evan goes to see who it could be and is greeted by two young women (wearing very little and soaked to the bone), who claim to be lost. A good samaritan, Evan allows the girls, Bel and Genesis (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo), into his home to dry off and to wait until a taxi arrives; as they pass the time, the young women initiate sexual banter with Evan, eventually seducing the poor man into a wild threesome.

What follows is a masterclass in terrible film-making, with clumsy writing (a whole neighbourhood out for the night. Really?) and woeful acting from its three main stars, who seem to be in competition with each other to see who can turn in the worst performance. As the unhinged girls toy with Evan, Roth's script leaves the viewer wandering what the point of the whole exercise is: it's not scary, it's not suspenseful (largely thanks to the terrible acting), and it doesn't work as a morality play, Evan obviously a decent fellow who, in a moment of weakness, understandably crumbles as two hot and eager young fillies soap each other up in the shower before offering themselves to him on a plate (a scene that earns the film at least one point).

Roth, either unaware of how dumb his film is or simply not bothered, blunders on regardless, giving us a train wreck of a movie that even he will find hard to beat in terms of sheer crappiness."
7.0,16 October 2023,"I recently revisited Knock Knock (2015) on Tubi. The film revolves around an author, alone at home as he wraps up his latest project while his wife and children are away on vacation. His quiet solitude is interrupted when two gorgeous, young ladies arrive at his door seeking help, and maybe a little more...

Directed by Eli Roth, known for The Green Inferno, and starring Keanu Reeves (The Matrix), Lorenza Izzo (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Ana de Armas (Blade Runner 2049) and Ignacia Allamand (The Green Inferno)

Knock Knock is a film that never fails to trigger anxiety with each viewing. The circumstances may seem far-fetched, yet they maintain a certain plausibility. The storyline keeps you riveted to the screen, keeping your heart rate pumping, albeit for different reasons at different times. The sex sequences are well-executed, as is the breakfast scene the following day (that scene gave me so much anxiety). The buildup might feel somewhat unrealistic, but I could also relate to the circumstances being impossible to resist. The ending is brilliant, and the cast, including Keanu Reeves and the captivating ladies, deliver strong performances. There's truly nothing I would change about this film.

In conclusion, Knock Knock is a smart, well-executed, and finely written gem by Roth. I would rate this a 7.5/10 and highly recommend watching it once."

1.0,30 November 2022,"Knock Knock kept me watching-glued to the screen eagerly & painfully waiting for what could possibly happen next. I had zero idea going into this movie what it was about. I knew it was an Eli Roth movie, so I was interested.

I think the bad reviews are coming from people expecting & wanting another 'Hostel'. Roth definitely still has that ability to make you feel as terrified & angry as the main character. I was shocked at the turn this one took- again showing us that humans are much scarier than any fictional being from the horror genre. When I watch a movie where all of the events are a possibility in the real world- it's always interesting.

The monsters in this movie are terrifying & it's easy to hate them by the end of the movie... I know I certainly did.

If you're in the mood for something with a new idea, not another torture porn horror flick (which I enjoy very much btw) that packs enough ""dramatic horror"" as anything else in this genre- then you will enjoy it. No special effects, no fake blood & guts. Instead, we see realistic events turning 1 man's life into hell. I recommend this movie. But if you want a ghost story or something to give you nightmares...maybe go for a different one. However this is well worth the run time."

4.0,16 May 2020,"Maybe I have bad taste or am just the specific niche audience this movie was made for, but I really don't get all the 1-star reviews. I'm glad I chose to watch it anyway! The shortest way to explain it is a gender-swapped Funny Games. This movie takes a lot of cues from other home invasion movies but still had its own flavor.

I think this movie is exactly what it sets out to be, and nothing more: a kinda trashy thriller with attractive people doing weird things. That's it. And I thought it worked for the most part. Anyone who knows Roth's work will see it in this movie-it's just that he usually employs gore to make us uncomfortable, but this time it's...the bizarre. I enjoyed seeing him make a movie that didn't rely on gore at all.

I genuinely laughed in many parts, and I think at least some of that humor was intentional. This is a solid B movie, not too much of a downer due to the great playful acting by Izzo and De Armas. Keanu Reeves feels pretty flat at first but it gets a bit better as the movie goes on. As another reviewer mentioned, if you're familiar with Nic Cage's ""not the bees"" meme, there's a scene in this movie with similar energy and I laughed pretty hard.

This movie is pretty ridiculous, but that's kind of the point. I thought it was interesting and never got bored. I also liked the way it ended. It won't be for everyone but it worked for me."

*** (out of 4)

Husband and father Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is home alone working during a storm when two ladies (Lorenza Izzo, Ana de Armas) knock on his door asking for directions. Both women are wet and cold so Evan invites them into his house to wait for a taxi but they soon seduce them into a threesome. The next day Evan realizes his mistake and tries to get rid of the women but soon he realizes they have different plans.

Eli Roth is best known for his sadistic horror movies but he tries something different here and while the film is highly flawed I thought it was good enough for what it was trying to do. I'm not going to spoil what happens throughout the movie but I thought the twists were rather good and for the most part we got some nice performances. Again, if you're wanting high art then this isn't going to be for you but for my money it was a nice erotic thriller that was at least entertaining throughout.

On a technical level this is the best thing I've seen from Roth has he actually does a very good job in the directing department and there's no question that the film is well-made. I thought the director did a very good job at establishing the Evan character by showing him to be a good guy but of course even the best of people can make a mistake, which could change their life. Again, I'm not going to ruin the plan of these women but it's an interesting idea and I think the story is good enough to hold your attention throughout.

The performances are for the most part good. Reeves does a nice job in the role that requires quite a bit from him. This includes playing that lovable father but he also handles the seduction scenes quite well and the various scenes where he is being tortured both physically and mentally. Both Izzo and de Armas are good in their roles as they both play erotic very well and I thought they also managed to be believable in the more deadly nature. Most importantly is that all three have some good chemistry no matter what they're doing.

As I said there are some logical issues that I had with some of the things that happen throughout the picture and at times you want to hit Evan over the head yourself for doing some foolish things. Still, KNOCK KNOCK really did keep me entertained throughout the running time and I found it to be interesting and worth watching."

1.0,1 August 2024,"This is a good home invasion movie, with psychopath characters that have a pretty plausible way of seeing things, which is a rare but important quality to my taste.

The movie makes you really uneasy, and leaves you with a conclusion that makes you wonder how close the psychopaths' assessment is to reality.

Some questions are left unanswered, which seems normal to me. What the author wanted to say has been said. That's also a rare but important quality.

Acting is good, directing is too, writing, emotion is there, it gets worse and worse as the trap closes shut.

I would watch this alone (as I would any atmosphere movie)"
1.0,4 February 2024,"Knock-knock is a film with a lowest rating I have ever seen on IMDB so far and I was pleasantly suprised after watching. No, it is not something that you crave to see in cinema with friends. It is something what you would watch with your girlfriend or wife in late afternoon in Saturday or Sunday in your comfy home on your comfy sofa and have lengthy conversation after it.

Basically it is story about a happily married upper class man and father of two who decides to help two young innocent looking girls, who are according to their story, simply lost on their way to some party going on somewhere in the city. Although it is never distinctly explained, who these girls really are or how they exactly planned it, through the film tiny clues are given to the viewer from what can be concluded, that in reality these girls have runned away from abusive homes and basically have been living in the streets ever since. Worst still, behind beatiful young faces, in fact, cruel, brutal, manipulative and ruthless female psycopaths are hiding, result of the life they had endured before.

It is also revealed that the girls specifically targeted that house and that man only because they envied him, his home and his family. Something, they never had. Because of that, they toy with him, seduce him, torture him and ruin his life as he knows it.

The best part of the movie actually is that women can be as manipulative, cruel, brutal and sadistic as men, even more so. Throughout the film I found myself asking again and again, why they do all that to that man. He is nice guy, loving father and husband who provides for his family. The simple answer is - just because they can. In the twisted minds of the girls, being happy and living a good life is as good reason as any to destroy it."

1.0,27 June 2015,"After spending a Saturday night watching a film I've been looking forward to see since I first saw the trailer, honestly I feel robbed of an hour and a half I'll never get back. This movie was nothing but a let down. To call this film a horror is like calling Spongebob Squarepants and Thomas the tank engine both horror programs.

You cannot tell the difference between normal Keanu Reeves and tied up petrified Keanu Reeves, it all sounded the same. Whenever he shouted it reminded me of the best cry ever/worst cry ever video in YouTube.

Overall this movie was a huge let down, very good idea for a film but a horrific execution. Save yourself a tenner and buy yourself a Chinese instead of a ticket!"
8.0,22 April 2016,"I think this movie is an example of how not to act. I think this movie could have been more interesting if Keanu Reeves would have acted a little. A ridiculous display of acting and direction. This guy has no expressions on his face, just like the furniture of the house does not give any expression. No difference in expressions when he is normal, when he is tied up, when he is crying. Story of the movie had a lot of loopholes. Most of the time you are wondering why this guy is not able to do anything.HOW can he BE so dumb? The plot had potential and could have been better. The worst film of the year. And the ending of the movie is really stupid."

It was truly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen in my life. I had high hopes for the movie before seeing it, especially since I'm a fan of Keanu Reeves in many of his other movies. However I found the movie to be utterly bizarre and ridiculous and struggled to sit through the whole movie and resist the urge to leave. The acting was really over the top at times and so painful to watch. The plot did have potential and could have been so much better but unfortunately it did not work at all in this movie. Many of the scenes are extremely creepy and perverted, and not what I would expect to see in any movie. I found parts of this movie very difficult to understand and follow, so that I eventually lost interest completely. The ending was one of the biggest disappointments and left me with feelings of relief that it was finally over and feeling like I'd just wasted the last 90 minutes of my life. Avoid this movie at all costs!!"

He's been beaten, toured, his life ruined, and his friend Louis lays dead and paper macheted. Still after all this, we're still left thinking, after knowing all this, is there anything he could have done differently. From a philosophical point of view, it's a no win scenerio."
7.0,30 April 2023,"I thought this movie was really good, when you're talking and yelling at the characters that means it's good. I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. The beginning wasn't great I admit, but, it gets better towards the middle. I thought the acting was pretty good for what it is. Keanu was a little cheesy in the beginning, but, again, it gets way better as it goes on. Those girls are just plain crazy and they play it up well. Everyone that watches this (especially guys), you are supposed to be mad and uncomfortable! That is intentional! Watch until the end, don't give up, it's good."
1.0,17 October 2015,"Do NOT waste your time. It's a rare thing for me to rate a movie so low, but this warped brain-rot excuse for a social commentary did in fact waste my time and seems to exist only to twist the minds of the audience and gratify deranged perverts (with such imagery as graffitied penises scribbled onto pictures of children). Obviously the director, or this pitiful excuse for a director, Eli Roth, wished to anger the audience to the point of frustration and then fail to provide any sort of satisfactory resolution as some sort of sick joke. Such failure to provide adequate closure is the ultimate flaw a director and their film can exhibit. I could've lived with the emotional strain if there was some sort of payoff in the end; however without that the film becomes little more than 90 minutes of chaos and ultimately fails. I'd also venture to question the mental health of Eli Roth with such a disturbing fascination with pedophilia. He seems to promote it more than he does criticise it, by glorifying the goblin-like antagonists and the sick and cruel deeds they carry out. Perhaps this is some twisted social experiment aimed at desensitizing the public. And why create a film which seems to mock and ooze contempt for art and then expect to be considered such? Because if he never intended this mess of a film to be considered art then all it is is just that, a mess. Awful. Absolutely awful."
6.0,10 October 2015,"I have never written a review but sometime a movie shakes you so much that you are forced to do things you have never done. This is the most irritating movie I have ever seen with all the characters demanding your anger to break the screen on whatever platform you are watching it. I could have stopped it after 10 minutes only but I had read the review where it was said that a ""good"" twist is in the store at the end. OMG!...nothing... this movie is nothings and I pity Keanu for producing it. How can he be so dumb to produce a movie where he did the worst acting of his career or for that matter worst of the worst actor's. Both the female characters were so dumbly irritating that you want to kill them while watching the movie. No story, no background music, no plot, no thrill nothing....even nothing has something but this movie...its vacuum!! Don't waste your time on this ...you are better off shitting in your toilet for 2 hours rather than watching this disgust."

See, everyone has a different perception.There are age groups and gender groups and people with different cultural backgrounds,there are teenagers and there are middle agers. So everyone sees something others are unable to see. Americans don't get French or Japanese movies, Europeans hate Hollywood crap that American teenagers and dumb people love (J.Aniston movies anyone?). First of all the acting was great. The story realistic and believable. So saying don't waste your time is like saying I like vanilla ice cream so you don't eat a chocolate one. 9 out of 10 Hollywood movies of the last 10 years are utter crap. Argo or Gravity (7.9 ratings???? How in the world?) are awful all around in my opinion. In fact Gravity is an insult to one's intelligence."

This is not acting, this is plain crap that should not be viewed by anyone. Save yourselves by watching something..anything but this. I should have watched the Street lights and got more entertainment. What on earth were these actors thinking. Eli Roth, what a disappointment!!!! .. u owe me an hour of my life back!!! I don't get how a man could not fight back against these tarts, or why he let them inside in the first place. These actresses should go back to waitress. Worst ever!!!!!"
1.0,8 December 2020,"Evan is a great guy, with a lovely family (a puppy included), a beautiful house and a job that he loves. His wife and kids go on a weekend vacation without him and in the first night alone two girls knock on his door, pretending to be lost. He offers to help them by calling an Uber and drying their clothes (it was raining outside). After a little bit of awkwardness, they start to chat and of course the conversation becomes more and more sexual and tension starts to build in and Evan becomes more and more uncomfortable with them. When the Uber arrives the girls decide to take a shower and when Evan desperately tries to take them out of the bathroom they seduce him. They have a threesome and in the next morning the girls are not so funny anymore: their personalities are erratic and even a bit dangerous. After arguing, he takes them home and go back to his house to clean up the mess. But at night they come back wanting revenge because he betrayed his family by sleeping with them (!). About the movie: the acting was horrible, specially from the actors pretending to be Keanu's family. The wife and kids awful...and even Keanu seemed a little off as a loving parent. The two girls (Lorenza and Ana) were not so bad, the problem is that they had no back story and no point for being doing all of they did. I took that they were abuse victims, specially Ana's character, after that scene where she ""rapes"" Keanu because she starts calling him daddy and asking why did he did all that to her. They were mentally unstable that's for sure. The greatest scene is the one Keanu gives his great speech, justifying why he couldn't have said no to them, by saying that what they had offered him was like free pizza and nobody refuses free pizza (sometimes we must). The movie is over the top, it's nonsense, sometimes it's funny, the audience don't get their revenge (happens often in life), an innocent man dies and the motivation of the girls, to punish married man that don't respect their families gets lost in all of this. It's not that bad if you don't expect anything good from it. It's free pizza..."
1.0,29 June 2016,"I usually can love anything with Keanu Reeves in it because he makes everything so much better. Unfortunately, this movie is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. I can usually appreciate watching every movie at least once even if I wouldn't watch it twice, but this one is painful to watch. Keanu was completely wrong for this role. The movie doesn't really even seem to have a point except to those that wrote it because you are left asking yourself what the motive even was for the characters doing what all they did. It is almost like watching sports to people that don't understand them. You see the characters doing things, but you can't quite ever figure out why and what the point of it all is. Reading the description I thought it would be awesome. Wrong. You can't even watch it for the steamy scenes because the chicks in the film are unattractive. I know it's hard to believe the reviews on here because a lot of times they are overly critical, but believe it on this one."

1.0,11 September 2020,"What could be considered a throwaway thriller, Knock Knock proves that you don't have to have the best script, direction, acting, or any aspect of the filmmaking process in order to entertain. With a nice message tagged at the end and a more than fun premise, Knock Knock absolutely thrills from beginning to end, even if it isn't awards caliber or entirely re-watchable. I dug it.

6.9/10"
6.0,5 November 2015,"After the less than stellar box office return of Hostel Part II, Eli Roth blamed the internet and swore off making films for a long time. In fact, he hasn't directed another movie since then. He's produced, starred in and wrote a few, but never touched the camera again, except for the sniper film that plays in Inglorious Basterds and the Thanksgiving segment from Grindhouse. Almost ten years later and we have not one, but two feature films from Roth. The Green Inferno, which was actually completed in 2013, but held up until now, and the erotic horror thriller Knock Knock, which is a remake of 1977 film Death Game.

Did Roth coming back from ""retirement"" encourage me to see the film? Was it the deranged sexual element that would draw me in? No, it was Keanu Reeves my friend. Everything else didn't matter to me, I wanted to see Keanu Reeves in movies again. He did a kick ass job in John Wick, now I was going to see if he would be able to play a helpless cheat who is terrified for his life. A role that is really against type for him. Can Reeves pull it off? The man has been labeled emotionless in a lot of his film roles, so this would seem like it would require him to dig down and actually act. Now, he does manage to scream, freak out and indeed, act terrified at times, but there is always and I mean always, something off about his performances. Maybe it's his monotone voice or the deadness behind his eyes, but it doesn't always come off well. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoy a lot of his work, but a great thespian the man is not. It looks like the man is trying here, I'm not too sure if he pulls it off too well.

Reeves plays Evan, an architect who has to stay at home for the long weekend and work, while his wife and two kids go to the beach house. One stormy night, he hears a knock at his door, two young beautiful women are stranded and need his help. While inside, they manage to seduce him, despite his constant resistance. The next morning he finds out that they won't leave, not without playing a game with him being an unwilling participant.

So the premise alone seems like a typical invasion torture horror flick, with the added element of sex and the intruders being young hot women. Once that is out of the way, the film offers nothing new or insightful. Roth, a man who knows a thing or two about the genre, tries to amp of the suspense a bit, but falls into the same generic traps all these films do. Knock Knock isn't sexy enough, nor terrifying enough. I guess it must just feel weird to direct your wife in a naked threesome with Keanu Reeves.

The question people will be asking themselves is, will Reeves live or die by the end of the film. I won't spoil how it ends, but the build up to that final situation is decent enough to make the film almost watchable. The denouement is completely wrong though and adds an unneeded comedic joke that is literally the very end of the film. You go through this long torturous journey with Reeves, only to have it end with a one liner? Really odd choice that left me scratching my head with disappointment. I wanted some kind of answer to what would happen next, but never got it. Roth leaves a little hint here or there, but I guess I wanted something a little more concrete.

What the film does accomplish is me, never opening my door to anyone. Not even two young, beautiful, wet women who beg me to let them inside so they can have sex with me. That's just for my dreams."
1.0,18 October 2015,"Words cannot describe how much I hated this movie. The sick twisted person who wrote this screenplay should be held for observation. I am normally a happy fun loving guy but this movie ruined my evening and I crashed at 10:30 on a weekend night.

Since I need to write 10 lines to meet the minimum requirements so I can warn other potential viewers about this movie, I will give a few sentence synopsis. Two young girls break in on a nice guy at his home one stormy evening. They assault and brutally torture him over a couple of days. Nothing sexy or funny or intriguing. Just brutal torture and murder."

When it comes to revamping classics and giving them a new modern take I felt as if Roth did a great job. This movie is in all sense of the word a horror thriller. The movie starts of with a man named Evan waking up on Father's Day greeted by his wife and two children. We find out that his wife is very successful artist and he an architect, living a very rich and happy life. His family is going out of town for the weekend and he will stay behind to work on a project. It's later in the movie that two beautiful young ladies show up at his door, soaking wet, and asking for help. Well these girls needed more mental help then they do a former DJ's. The movie in my opinion was another great Eli Roth film. Roth always uses some of his actors and actress's from past films he's worked on which may be the reason people don't enjoy his films as much,as it would be nice to see some new faces. This movie in itself has you wondering the entire film on if they will if they won't. I give it a six as like most viewers the ending was not my favorite, but that's the thing about Roth's films... he never lets the audience in on how things are going to happen until they do. If you like any type of thriller movies I do recommend this film. Definitely was worth the watch and not a waste of time. I was genuinely on edge the entire movie, and really didn't expect that good of the film from reviews. I find that most people don't enjoy this movie as it doesn't give you the ending you want, the crazy revenge or the caught in the act. It simply leaves you with that knot in you stomach wishing there was more, but at the end of the day this a movie I will think about and will recommend others to enjoy :)"

3.0,26 October 2018,"I actually enjoyed this movie. I can't compare to the 70's movie that I never saw and was not aware of. This started off painfully slow as it showed the happy life of a supposedly devoted family man (""I love you....no, I love you more...smooch smooch.....""). But then it does pick up when the ""girls"" enter. I think for an architect, he was either not very bright or very naive, as their psychosis was apparent from within several minutes of them being inside the house. Things got very suspenseful and then turned a little sadistic, which I did not like. But then it got better. Overall, some of the scenes were a little too sadistic for my taste, but I did like Keanu in this. It is quite a dark movie. The acting by the girls was good."

I mean, if you want to run a satire do it all the way, it's not clear if this movie is meant to be funny which I guess it's the point... and it is NOT...Its upsetting, the death of that guy...well in fact most of the movie is upsetting and it's outrageous to see actors and producers spend money to do this and I expect they don't profit out of this wacky film...

The plot was promising but that was just all. I lost in facebook, on my phone... while trying to keep attantion to film. There were really messed up scenes without a point, if Eli Roth tried to tell some story and wanted to make a point I can easily say he failed hard this time.

7.0,14 April 2016,"**Spoiler alert for both 'Knock Knock' and 'Gone Girl'**

In today's feminist society, people aren't ready for a film that depicts the extent of female sexual power over men.

This movie caricatures and exaggerates just what two cute women can get away with, to delicious and frankly, genius effect.

Eli Roth knew what he was doing (for instance) with the scenes where the girls grill the protagonist on what happens to alleged sexual predators. They can do what they want and they will get away with it because they're young, attractive white women and they can always claim victimhood. It's the world we live in at the moment. It is completely ridiculous when you see it. Most men are too naive to acknowledge it and most women are too reliant on this status quo to admit it.

The script is perfect because very few (if any) straight men would have been able to resist the sexual aggression of the women (Keanu's character did the best any man would do - which is why they resorted to physicality, essentially rape - and Keanu's character later had to apologise for this, whilst tied up! You see? Ridiculous). Taking the utter ludicrousness of this situation to it's extreme, and then taking it further and then a bit further is just the sledgehammer approach needed to tell this story. And yet, as evidenced by the reviews, people are still reluctant acknowledge it. They can't swallow it.

This exact story is told in 'Gone Girl' but with a lot more subtlety. Similarly, in Gone Girl, Amy accuses someone of rape, and gets away with it, then accuses someone of murder, and gets away with it, then rapes and murders someone... AND GETS AWAY WITH IT! You see? Ridiculous.

And in today's feminist society, most people are too brainwashed to comprehend the enormity of this situation.

Bravo to Eli Roth, Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo, and Ana de Armas for putting together a modern subversive masterpiece."

During hide and seek game also Keanu Reeves doesn't think to kill them but tries to run away. Even that guy Louis jump for the medicine but doesn't get idea to beat those girls and take it.

1.0,17 October 2015,"A film like Knock Knock defensively positions itself as a comedy to cushion against any criticisms. If someone is offended or disgusted by the subject matter, the film's fans can simply claim that it is in on the joke of it all, and that that's ""the point.""

Some ""meta-bad"" films earn this cushion. Last year's The Guest, starring Dan Stevens, would have been quite poor if sold earnestly, but it had a devilish sense of humour about itself, and paid homage to '80s films with a wink and a nod without just becoming a giant piece of garbage.

Knock Knock is a giant piece of garbage. A giant piece of garbage made by a man who has little to no evidence of talent. I've always felt that Eli Roth looked extremely creepy, something Tarantino capitalized upon by casting him as a sociopath in Inglourious Basterds. It's not fair to judge someone's personality or self-merit based upon their looks. However, it's fairer to judge someone based upon their art, and Roth's -- consumed with body-horror, torture porn (remember he helped jumpstart the craze with Hostel), and grimy sexual antics -- seems to paint a disturbing portrait indeed. The fact that he cast his considerably younger wife in the lead role of this film, and then put her name above the title next to Keanu Reeves, is Hollywood nepotism at its finest. As a critic, I try to remain objective, and there are truly few actors or filmmakers I just downright dislike; there are some whose personal lives may disappoint me (e.g. Polanski), but I separate the art from the artist. But Roth's art is vile, and goes hand-in-hand with my perspective of him as someone who gets off on all this filth. I don't think there's ever been any kind of true social or political commentary to his work -- which the best gross-out horror films tend to have, including the film he attempts to shamelessly rip off here, Funny Games.

No, Roth gets his kicks from getting his wife naked on camera, having Keanu Reeves -- who looks regretful in every scene, and not because he's in character -- bullied, bloodied, raped and tortured.

The dialogue is terrible, the cinematography is shoddy (it basically went straight to video, which is what you'd gather from the way it's shot), the story is stupid which would be OK if the film had something clever to say, but instead Roth presents this all in a transparent attempt to shock and outrage while being too lazy to have any commitment to the material, instead hiding behind the ""irony"" angle and playing it out as a borderline farce.

Reeves, who gained so much goodwill with last year's John Wick, gives one of his worst performances here; Roth's wife, whose name I do not recall and don't care to, is a coarse screen presence; and Ana de Armas just seems like she's being exploited here.

I only gave this a chance because of Reeves, but I should have known better when I saw Roth's name attached. It is a great mystery as to why this man continues to have a film career."
7.0,13 October 2015,"Eli Roth is one of the best filmmakers working today. He's notably a member of the ""Splat Pack"" - a group of filmmakers notorious for the overly violent and explicit style of their films. 'Knock Knock' is quite unlike anything Roth has done up to this point though and it caught me quite off guard. This time around he's gone for a more thought-provoking style, and whilst it's far from perfect, it contains a uniqueness that all his films have and which brings an added layer of quality to the story.

Roth has an ability, possibly superior to any other current director in the horror genre, to build tremendous characters. One of his earlier films 'Hostel' is known as one of the most brutal, hard to watch films ever created. However what people rarely mention about that film is that nearly the entire first half is taken up purely with character development. He takes the extra time to make us care for the characters so that later on when they meet their fates it has that much more effect on the audience. 'Knock Knock' has that same endless patience for the first half, and whilst it is undoubtedly a very different film to 'Hostel', the same affect is utilised.

This is a very similar film to 'Funny Games'. It catches you off guard with with its almost complete lack of motivation. Is it more disturbing to know why someone is ruining your life, or to have no idea whatsoever? Probably the latter. It's not a perfect film. The ending wasn't as cleanly done and memorable as we are perhaps used to from Roth films. The ethics behind the girls actions are questionable but they're a good conversation starter so that probably remains a good thing. Keanu Reeves in the main role actually impressed me. He plays ""likeable"" just so well that he's ideally suited to a role like this. Overall a good film but I hope Roth keeps churning out out-and-out horror films because he's just so damn good at them."
1.0,13 March 2023,"Many years ago, a film came out where a pair of young seductresses managed to sneak into the home of a middle-aged rich man, seduce him and torment him: ""Death Game"" is one of those films that almost no one will remember now. I haven't seen it yet, but having seen this modern remake, I'm curious to see the older film.

Eli Roth gives us a very simple film. What I said above fits this film perfectly: Evan Webber is a conventional husband and family man who makes the mistake of giving shelter to two really attractive girls who, after a shower and clean clothes, decide to repay him with a night of adulterous and totally sinful sex. However, what seemed like an erotic dream come true turns into a nightmare when they begin to terrorize Evan.

This is not a brilliant, surprising film, it will never join a pantheon of great films, whatever genre or subgenre it may be, but it works and gives us what it promises: a sense of menace and pleasant tension, entertainment and a decent story. Of course, there are problems. For example, how would those girls know so much about Evan and his family without having spent a good deal of time spying on him? They showed, at various times, that he had not been chosen at random and that there was an intention in what they were doing with him. This is weird because the movie wants to explain it, but it doesn't do it very well. Personally, I think it would have been better if the film didn't exploit their intentions and just played with all the information they could get from Evan on that short night visit.

Be that as it may, this is, as far as I've seen, Eli Roth's best film to date: ""Cabin Fever"" was a decent effort, but very campy, and ""Hostel"" turned out to be simply unpalatable in its ambition to imitate the worst of ""Saw"". Roth seems to have finally learned that what scares us most is what is beyond our sight or foresight. Liters of fake blood and human bodies being hacked to pieces only serve to ruin the theater popcorn vendor's business.

Keany Reeves is the film's big star and the highest rated, and perhaps highest paid, actor here. He did a good job, with a character that, in other hands, could have been more limited, one-dimensional or sketchy. Over time, Reeves gives us a simple, down-to-earth, credibly authentic man, someone we can like. Someone who makes mistakes, but who still elicits sympathy by being punished far more severely than could be justified. Reeves never lets the character be just a puppet. However, the film is entirely dominated by female performances: slender and dangerous, Lorenza Izzo - the director's wife - and Cuban newcomer Ana de Armas deserve our full attention.

Technically, it is a film that stands out for its simplicity: everything takes place in a unique environment, and the scenery and costumes are reduced to the simplest, but effective and functional. Cinematography does not bring surprises or innovations, it bets on conventional formats and solutions and on pragmatism. The soundtrack isn't especially notable either."
6.0,12 February 2017,"What a terrible movie!!! It was the worst movie I have ever watched. I did not like the story, concept, ending,,,and EVERYTHING. It does not matter how much you enjoy to watch mystery movie: with Knock Knock, you are better off saving your time. I don't even know why or how Keanu Reeves accepted this offer, it was bad decision to make. I was so disappointed. I did not understand why did not he go against two teenagers. In real life, almost every men would go against if they were in the same situation. Just running outside but fell off the ground? He had a knife and pan to attack these two. I really wish the actor was not Keanu Reeves, I watched it because of him. If the character was acted by a different actor, I would not even choose it. One thing I learned from watching this movie was how terrible Eli Roth was. What an awful job he has done it. This movie is piece of crap."
1.0,23 February 2017,"Trailer was kind of interesting. Me and my wife just watched the movie....and oh my goodness is it trash. Acting was trash, plot made no sense. What a waste of time, I normally don't review movies, but this movie was so bad I had to say something. If you bought this movie, return it, if you are thinking about renting it, don't. I can't stress how much this movie was horrible, like a flaming dumpster juice cocktail. This is worst than running out of toilet paper after you had the runs from a taco bell chalupa with extra hot sauce, it does not end well."

6.0,27 June 2015,"It's hard to begin with dreadful film. I went into it with low expectation's and was still utterly flabbergasted by how awful this was! Knock Knock makes Batman & Robin look like Oscar worthy movie.

I don't know what Keanu Reeves was thinking when he agreed to star in this movie but after the incredible John Wick I thought he was getting his career back on track after a run of disastrous movies but I guess not. His performance was so terrible that the audience were laughing out loud, laughing.

I won't spoil the film for you but it's difficult to watch, I've never seen so many people walk out of movie before, honestly.

This is 99 minutes of pure hell as a viewer. It's not even in the ""it's so bad it's good"" club. The film is tripe, utterly unwatchable completely unredeemable in any sense.

This film is a career killer and I suggest you stay the hell away from it.

If you want to watch an adult movie in the cinema go see Mad Max: Fury Road. Trust me, Knock Knock is one you don't want to watch."

1.0,26 October 2015,"This movie is a waste of space... I streamed it so I am SO glad I didn't actually pay for it. I RARELY write reviews at all, and I'm known for always rooting for the underdog (in this case, started out hoping his character escapes and the nutball chicks get their just desserts). That being said... Reeves acting was terrible, and the character was so pathetic that by the end I just kinda hoping they would off him and put me out of my misery for being one of those people that just has to find out what happens so he watches until the end regardless. I think I've only walked out on a movie once... I was watching this at home and it made me want to just walk out of here and go somewhere else untainted by this flick. Keanu should be ashamed of himself for being in this movie, and Eli Roth should be knee'd in the nether regions."
1.0,14 June 2018,"This would be a husband and fathers worse nightmare. Is Evan (Keanu Reeves) responsible for the predicament he got himself into? You bet your a## he is. Evan is an architect who is happily married to a successful sculpture artist named Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and admittingly they have been going through a dry spell in their boudoir. So when Karen and the two kids go away for the weekend to a cottage without their daddy/husband so that Evan can finish a big job at home that he has been working on, the family all are in a good place.

Then there is that innocent knock on the door later in the evening where Evan is faced with two attractive nubile and very wet and hot looking young ladies who just want to get out of the pouring rain and use Evan's home phone so that they can get to the party that they have somehow got lost and instead landed on Evan's front doorstep.

A warm smile and handshake introduction, leads the ladies into a few giggles and then before Evan knows it he is in the shower with the two ladies getting his stick licked and just like Samson who loses his strength when he gets his long hair cut so does Evan after the ladies whack him over the head, tie him up, and ironically cut his hair as well.

This is a remake of the 1977 film Death Game that originally starred Sondra Locke, Colleen Camp, and their victim was Seymour Cassel. In fact Colleen Camp reappears in this remake half way into the film as she plays the older, frumpier masseuse who shows up to give Evan a massage but she is quickly turned around by the two younger and aggressive women Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas). Bell displays some really bad memories with her ""daddy issues"" as she coyly plays with Evan's head. She actually plays with both of Evan's two heads if you get my drift.

After terrorizing Evan in his own home, destroying his neat and tidy home from top to bottom as he remains tied up, and then assaulting an employee of Karen's who dropped by to pick up one of Karen's sculpture, we the audience wonder what will happen when Karen and her two children return home form the cottage. And then Karen and her two children eventually come home, walk in the front door and call out to Evan, ""Honey ... I'm home""."

It's exploitation crap, of course - and people were giggling at the end in the cinema where I saw it, where the tone does wobble - indeed, one man stood up and announced, ""That's the worst film I've ever seen"".

Above all, the film contains a few genuine and uncomfortable truths about male sexuality, and I suspect that alone will guarantee it an afterlife."

I really can't wrap my head around the fact that Keanu Reeves actually signed to do this garbage, I am extremely disappointed, even Keanu acting was horrible.

I wish i could have given this movie 0/10.

8.0,17 October 2015,"If ""Knock Knock"" is supposed to be a horror film, it did not do a good job. I was not scared one single time, if anything I was rather horrified by the pointlessly evil actions. It did not provide any storyline as to explain any reasons why this was going on. Instead of spending one and a half hours watching a moderately scary horror film, I spent one and a half hours watching a film with no intentions but to show cruelty. The film started off in somewhat of a cute manner, preceded by being annoyingly immoral and then turned into a frenzy of just plain animalistic cruelty. ""Knock Knock"" did not pull on any of the strings I would have liked it too when watching a horror film. If you want to feel miserable, this is just the film you want to watch. If you want to be scared (of anything other than the quality of the horror industry, this is not the film you want to watch."

3.0,14 October 2015,"My friends were telling me about what a twerp Eli Roth was, so I watched this film to find out if it was true. All I can say is WHAT A TROLL. Why would anyone make such nasty insulting movies? I mean, they're not even funny. Usually there's a element of camp to bad horror but Eli Roth is simply an arrogant maladjusted attention seeker with nothing useful to offer humanity. His psychopathic behavior appears to be consistent with the traits common to most criminals, including sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, the need for control, and predatory behavior.

There is not a single shred of anything redeeming in his work. Seriously, what happened to this guy? Was it lack of attention during his upbringing? Bullying at school? Poor potty training? What created such a useless psychotic troll as Eli Roth? He makes his movies so people know he exists as an immature, callous, inconsiderate and pitiful human.

The truly insulting thing is he stands there like a smiling, petulant 8-year old saying that's the reaction he wants. He wants to present us with this type of challenge because he is a TROLL MOVIE DIRECTOR. My friends were right. Our culture would be considerably improved if Eli Roth would fall backwards off a cliff."
1.0,17 November 2018,"This is a very well made erotic thriller about a husband/father who's systematically being taken apart psychologically and physically - the morale of the film is very good, and a mature mind with life experience will appreciate it. Was also surprised of how much humor is in it. It's not a comedy, obviously - but the movie has many tongue-in-cheek moments and I think that's very smart because it's about tension, relief, tension, relief. A lot of suspense films such as thrillers or horrors don't understand that if the music is drumming for over 1.5hrs and no relief for the audience it will become tiring. Here the filmmaker is well aware of all the notes to hit and the crescendo is just bravo!

Also, the movie does not go into grotesque territory to be shocking - it keeps the suspense without resorting to what modern horror movie genre has become synonymous with - torture porn. There is nothing scary in someone's tooth being pulled out - it's disgusting, and I was happy to see that this film was able to keep me and my wife on the edge of our seats throughout. Eli Roth has crafted an intelligent and very well made erotic thriller. There are so few of these being made at such a level, and I appreciate the hard work put into it.

I rarely write reviews (I think this is my second one in a span of 14 years). The reason I decided to write something down is because I avoided watching this film for a while because it got some very harsh reviews. Upon watching it I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was engaging through-out with very minor script-related hiccups, but it certainly is not worthy of all the 1 star reviews. Those who leave them, I think have seen very few films in their life - probably only the big ones that hit cinemas. Perhaps if it was another actor that is not associated with blockbuster candy popcorn, the movie would be considered a cult classic."

2.0,15 April 2021,
8.0,13 January 2016,"Let me start off by saying that I really enjoy a lot of Eli Roth's work. Cabin Fever was the first of his films that I watched and I love it. Hostel was not too bad for what it was, and I've watched it a few times- while many don't like the ""torture porn"" aspect of it, I've always thought that it was a very creepy, unsettling movie and had great atmosphere. I recently watched The Green Inferno and enjoyed that a lot as well, despite it getting fairly bad reviews from a lot of people. At any rate, the point is that I've definitely been an Eli Roth fan for a while now.

I'm also a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. I've seen nearly every film he's been in- that's how big of a Reeves fan I am. That doesn't make me blind to his acting capabilities though. There are definitely movies he's been in where his performance leaves much to be desired. But I thought he was amazing in certain roles, like Constantine, The Devil's Advocate, etc. and even some of his romantic roles like Sweet November were pretty decent.

But my god. This movie was just horrible. It pains me to say that, since it combines two people I'm definitely a fan of, but there are no redeeming qualities about this movie except the very cute French Bulldog.

The girls' acting was pretty good; they were seductive and psychotic and did well in their roles. But Keanu was terrible; the scenes where he's being hurt in some way and screaming are completely unconvincing. I did like the first bit of the movie with his family, I'll give him that.

The ""plot"" is pretty bad, the pacing is just terrible and overall I found this movie just really...boring. That's probably the best way to describe it. I was thinking for a Roth film that there would be more awful things happening but in all honesty, without trying to spoil anything, the physical stuff that the girls put Reeves through is mild at best.

I also would have liked a bit more depth to the girls and why they were doing everything but I suppose that's probably a minor complaint compared to the rest of the problems with this movie.

Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed such masterpieces as ""Wrong Turn 3: Left for Dead"" way more than I enjoyed this movie, and Paris Hilton's performance in ""House of Wax"" was superior to Reeves in this film."
7.0,29 June 2015,
1.0,12 June 2020,"A remake of a 1977 cult film called ""Death Game"", ""Knock Knock"" follows the same basic premise. A husband / father (Keanu Reeves), alone for the weekend, actually answers his door in the wee hours of the morning, giving shelter to two attractive ladies (Lorenza Izzo, Ana de Armas) who were supposedly on their way to a party. Then the fun-loving babes simply refuse to leave, openly seduce Keanu into an act of indiscretion, and proceed to make a shambles of his life.

At the very least, ""Knock Knock"" offers two high-spirited performances by Izzo (married to co-writer / co-producer / director Eli Roth at the time) and de Armas, who do look like they're having fun. The second half of the movie sees the two of them turn Keanu's whole existence into a twisted nightmare. As part of their game, they aim to ""punish"" him for being a failure as a husband and father. They eat much of his food, total his house, cause the death of a supporting character, etc., etc. There's just no end to their shenanigans.

Keanu actually goes for broke for once, seeming to channel his inner Nicolas Cage, giving a performance that is pretty damn funny in its ridiculousness. It's not really a ""good"" acting job, but it does entertain. This viewer would agree with some that have seen this that his ""free pizza"" speech is a highlight.

As dark comedies go, this is pretty trashy stuff, but it was good for some amusement for yours truly. Therefore, I can't really hate it as some viewers do.

Colleen Camp and Sondra Locke, who starred in ""Death Game"" 38 years previous, are among the producers and executive producers here; Camp also appears briefly.

They'll moan about how predictable and samey movies are nowadays, saying that they knew exactly where Knock Knock was going to end up, and then whinge about the ending saying that Keanu Reeves character should have turned into John Wick and gone all Gun-Fu on the two girls.

Maybe we just deserve to be force fed Star Wars 23: The Jar Jar Binks Origin Story, Marvel: The Pancake Warrior, Transformers: Optimus Boredom and The Fast And Furious 637 forever.

I too was expecting in typical Hollywood fashion for Evan to pull a rabbit out of the hat and turn the tables on his abusers. And even though I was sickened, angry and frustrated by the ending, on reflection, I'm glad that Knock Knock made me actually feel something, because 95% of movies are just formulaic, test audience approved, regurgitated, cut and paste souless crap.

1.0,27 October 2015,"Knock Knock is Eli Roth's second movie this year and we see that the craft has been better compared to the other one and he is handling the erotic thriller territory than just another torture porn refuses to be an exploitation film. And to be honest, this turn is far more interesting. The film builds an atmosphere and lets the audience dive into it. The self-aware humor works better as well. And then it eventually gets obnoxious, I believe that's the entire point of it, but what kills it when it's trying to say something directly important, except it's not wise enough earn that sentiment. It's still reasonable that it catches your attention from beginning to end, but the final note is not as strong as it hoped to be.

The film opens showing us that the main character has a happy family and eventually it will all fall apart once the two girls enter the picture. But how these psychos tear this guy's life down has an entertaining slow burn. Regarding this as a hospitality went wrong, how these two girls win Evan (Keanu Reeves) over is not just some typical seduction. They interact with him like he is being demeaned into mid-life crisis. Right after he gives in, it's fully revealed the two girls are downright psychopaths and they're clever enough to give Evan a serious excuse to not arrest them. It's an intense conflict, not by physical torture, but by wrecking one's own dignity. And it gets out of hand until the two girls become too obnoxious rather than dangerous. While that's the movie's sense of humor, it also messes with its potent themes. This is mostly concerned on the ending, which could have been powerfully uneasy when it stops there, but the film wants a final punchline which foolishly leads itself to a safer direction.

The direction knows how to manifest a very, very atmosphere, even if the conflict are just insane hot girls, it doesn't always become predictable. And the acting is just priceless, this movie gives people a reason why to love Keanu Reeves even more. This is a role where he finally gives in, by broadening the single insane moment he had in John Wick to the entire haunting experience he had in this one. He comes close to Nicolas Cage's The Wicker Man performance, except in this context, it seems more appropriate and just equally enjoyable. Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas are ultimately campy enough as some of the most outrageous characters you'll ever see.

Knock Knock is probably the most entertaining of Eli Roth's oeuvre. Sure, it doesn't contain the amount of violence and gore he is known for, but in this unlikely turn, I think this movie has more intriguing and really outrageous choices to bring shock value. Then again, the final punchline just kills the momentum, underwhelming what you're already experiencing. Besides, it's starting to get annoying once it gets too far, and there isn't really much about it in the end. Keanu Reeves's total madness is kind of magical to witness, but the movie itself is just designed to have fun until it finally get on your nerves."

7.0,29 July 2022,"One of the most understood films i've seen in a long while. Rating 4.9? And all the reviews saying nothing happens and it is boring? Wow, I am shocked. This is a really smart concept for a horror.

Women have managed to achieve the pervasion of a narrative in modern society that paints all men as potential or closet abusers, exploiters, tyrants etc. Which by extension allows women to be painted as victims, innocents, and morally and spiritually superior, etc. Terms like 'toxic male' are banded around like they are god-given facts, the unchallengeable basis on which arguments begin. Where is the equivalent phrase 'toxic female'? Unfortunately for men, shadow masculinity is easily seen by the naked eye, in physical violence, in material destruction. Where luckily for women, shadow femininity is not so easily seen by the naked eye, in emotional manipulation, status destruction, relationship tyranny. But the two are the same in the amount of pain and terrible consequences they can result in. So far women have managed to get away with this. I don't know how this has happened. It can only have happened with the support of a good cross-section of men. Sycophantic men with no self-esteem who think that agreeing with women, especially when it feeds their ego and emboldens them against their vulnerability they don't have the courage to accept, is finally a way they can worm into their pants. Unfortunately for these men, it doesn't work, and unfortunately for everyone else, we are left as a result with this terribly painful and damaging ideological battle between the sexes which breeds the demonisation of men within women, and the subsequent retaliation and hatred of women within men. When women choose to give in to this dogma and mobilise a real-world stand against their supposed oppressors, the greatest asset that they have with which they can lure, seduce, manipulate, gain power over, and destroy men is their bodies, the access to sex that they gatekeep, their sexuality. And when a woman is so young, fertile, attractive, sexy, and apparently available, as the women in this film are, this asset is a virtually indestructible weapon that no man has the tools to be able to defend against.

And so men's greatest fear is the predatory succubus. The highly attractive seductress who has detached so much from her own body and others around her that she can treat her body as an object/a weapon, and those around her (men) as pawns within her game of narcissistic pleasure, for her material gain, for what they can provide for her, for her ego trip, for her self-empowerment. These kind of women destroy men (e.g. Amber Heard). The golddiggers who seduce men and then with support of the bent family law system suck them dry in divorce and take their children away from him. The loose women who trick young men into getting them pregnant and spend all the child maintenance on themselves. And men are defenceless against them. And there are so few films which are brave enough to even broach this topic and admit that this fear exists within every man and that there are women out there who abuse men just as much as there are men who abuse women. But to use it as a source for a horror film is genius.

Sadly, the film itself, granted, isn't actually that enjoyable. It is a bit slow, and full of logical holes. And the acting quite frankly almost makes it feel like a comedy at times. So this is an example of a film whose depth and subtext is totally fantastic, but the vehicle with which to tell it is unfortunately not that great.

And BTW, I am a woman."
1.0,10 October 2015,"Never really looked that promising to begin with, Although I'm a massive Keanu Reeves fan this did little to help that, but was one of the reasons I felt inclined to view it, However it's just a big ball of puke, its not enjoyable and it doesn't have any humour (as some say).

On a politician's view, I wonder if Feminist's will mention this? or will they enjoy it? imagine this film but roles reversed, the man comes in and rapes and tortures the two ladies... That wouldn't make it past a full script review.

This isn't enjoyable at all like I've said, but its hard to sum up how bad this is."

It's a movie about two girls with daddy-issues blackmailing a father and husband. I love the way the whole situation escalates kind of like in the movie 'Funny games'.

If you're into these kind of movies ""knock knock"" is an instant watch. The movie is well acted and the script was not quite predictable as i expected. The movie does not serve any answers for what motivates the 2 girls doing the things they do. This makes this movie less dramatic and serious, and that fits the movie well."
10.0,9 October 2016,"I really wish I had listened to other reviewers. That said, I am all for giving movies even with a low IMDb rating a chance because tastes are subjective. If I could give this film a negative rating I would happily do so. It truly is the most ridiculous piece of crap I think I have ever seen. The acting was abysmal and the premise was beyond absurd. They used a great song (used in an older amazing film) at the end which was the last straw for me. Not naming the song or band so no spoilers. I cannot believe Keanu Reeves participated in this piece of excrement. I hope he needed the money because my god, what an embarrassment. There were elements used (social media) that could be implemented nicely in a well scripted film. This wasn't it. Watch it if you feel you must but expect the worst because that is exactly what you will get."

It would have been more pleasurable for me to watch the intricacies and complexities of paint drying on a wall. The beginning of the movie starts off with the forced ""family time"" for the obligatory 10 minutes so we can make sure we get the idea what a great family man keanu is. You could tell within the first 10 minutes that the movie is a flop but for some reason you keep holding out hope that it'll get better. Don't hope. This movie is perfect for those times when you want to break up with someone and don't know how. Just invite them over and tell them that this is your favourite movie.

3.0,25 October 2015,"I have read everything about this film from ''This'' to ''that'' to ''Keanu Reeves character should be this or that, or more brilliant''... well he is a guy that let 2 chick enter his house. Sure, he want to help them but he want them out as soon as possible. He got a wife and 2 kids. Then, the drama begin, would you sleep with 2 beautiful women that never stop to tease you without thinking seriously about the consequences... Eli Roth think about this. Not just the aftermath, but what theses womens can do to your life and control your life in a way that you will want to cut your ''in-between'' for what will happen next.

In ''Knock Knock'' many answers will be respond. It is not the best film ever but it is a breath of fresh air. The acting is good, i'm digging Eli's wife, Lorenza Izzo, she is more talented that ''B'' flick usual chick and that other actress is terrific as well. A film with barely 3 actors for 100 minutes and being a film entertaining and not as predictable as you will think, is fine with me ! This movie should not be bash the way some users did."
10.0,27 May 2020,"Never posted a review on IMDb before. Tried to watch this movie 4 times before, since I generally like Keanu Reeves movies, but never managed to watch longer than maybe an hour or so. Then I switched it off, because the movie got worse and worse. I was still curious to find out if the scriptwriters would succeed in turning the movie around. But they couldn't. At my 5th attempt I succeeded in watching the entire movie, but don't ask me how. This movie is a complete waste of time and money. Despite Keanu Reeves and Ana de Armas, who are both decent actors, there was no saving this movie, all due to a horrible and utterly not credible script. By far the worst movie I ever saw and I've seen a lot. Haven't checked the other reviews but can't imagine there will be even one positive review."
7.0,6 October 2017,"I decided to watch this movie as I really enjoy thriller movies. I also watched it as I like the main character in other movies.

And maybe something that helped either this movie or him starring in it. There are worse ways and roles a man has to play than being seduced like he is in this movie.

But everything comes with a price. And though it is established that he had some issues with being faithful at the beginning, what he has to go through can not be described as learning experience. But how can this all end? I wouldn't say it's too surprising (the alternate ending would have been, though I don't think it would have fitted the mood of the movie), quite the opposite. Whether you like that or not, is up to you as viewer. Also if you want to pass moral judgement on any of the characters involved in this ..."

7.0,6 November 2015,"""I don't believe that people just meet randomly."" Evan Webber (Reeves) has just said goodbye to his wife and kids as they leave for the weekend, allowing Evan to finally get some writing done. That night two women knock on his door in the rain and ask for his help. What starts off as a gesture of good faith soon takes a turn and Evan does something he shouldn't have. Now the women won't leave, and Evan is forced to atone for his sins. There have been a ton of home invasion movies like this one, usually the same thing happens in all of them. This one is different, in a good way. Part Fatal Attraction, part Hard Candy, and all tense and creepy. The most disturbing part of this movie is that it isn't that unbelievable. Nothing is really over the top or cheesyuntil the end. This is more psychological than straight horror, but the pacing and the events really work well together and I found myself really enjoying this movie quite a bit. Keanu Reeves' acting leaves a lot to be desired (as usual) and is actually unintentionally comical but I recommend this and liked it much more than I expected to. Overall, tense and pretty believable, which added to the suspense. I give this a B."

John Wick was a great action flick with great cinematography and wicked action scenes but this is just, his acting is just hideous in this one. Finding out that one of the main ""actresses"" in the movie was also a director's wife didn't help the already horrid impression that's for sure. I'm gonna try and forget I watched this now."

I feel like I've wasted 2 hours of my life. Damn I did not know I was required to write at least 10 lines of text just to have my comment posted. All I want to say is that this movie sucks and nothing more. So.... I've never seen Keanu Reeves perform so badly in a movie. It's just filled with awkwardness. There is no meaning to the story. It give you nothing to think about. This movie is pure awkwardness. It's like watching Keanu Reeves fail miserably over and over again.
1.0,4 July 2015,"The message of the movie is pretty interesting, and one I do agree with.

Everything else seemed pretty cheap. The beginning was interesting, but it seemed to drag on for more than half the movie. Felt like watching a cheap porno. The second half, the torture was not particularly terrifying and the actions of the characters were neither here nor there. Also Keanu Reeves was not very convincing in the film.

Hard Candy did a much better (and terrifying) job of exploring the shallowness of man(kind), so I would suggest that over Knock Knock. Overall though, the movie was an interesting watch and definitely different to most films currently out there. So, if you're bored with the regular thrillers, this might just be for you."

But you can be disappointed in the plot or ending or what happened, but the movie wasn't cheap or had bad acting. It was a pretty well directed and filmed movie with solid acting.

People say it was predictable. I'd say not so much. People wanted great revenge, and understandably so, but that would have been predictable, right?

I liked it. It's akin to Fatal Attraction, that provides a lesson you can never learn often enough, men. Learn to just say no.

Granted the movie isn't very deep. It's 1.5 hours. So as far as a short movie goes, it was perfectly fine. Not anything slated for a Oscar or Emmy. But certainly not horrible."
1.0,26 June 2015,"It's a dream roughly 100% of men have had. And yet it turns into one mans worst nightmare. Evan's (Keanu Reeves) ridiculously cliché happy family have left him alone for the weekend, presumably to buy more 'Worlds Best Dad' mugs. That's when two young ladies lost in rainstorm find themselves at his door.

The film from here on can be split into two major parts. The first, Evan's seduction. Which was generally well done and convincingly acted by both Keanu and the two girls. It was easy to empathize with Evan as he battled with his worries, his guilt and his desire to give in to the temptresses.

The second half of the film is where things get a little shaky. The girls return to Evan, to punish him for his infidelity. And while they are both believably crazy. the scenes very rarely have moments of tension. In fact the set pieces bring more humor than anything else. It has all the standard thriller tropes, a very weak 'torture' scene, a shocking revelation and even a scene where Evan snaps. They were all met by laughter from the audience.

The only danger is from Evan's fear of what will happen when his wife finds out. And even that is dispelled by the end in a scene which very clearly leaves him looking like a victim.

Overall it was somewhat enjoyable, but not for the reasons Eli Roth would of hoped I imagine. And I can't help but wonder. What came first, The protagonist being named Evan or that horrible knock,knock joke/pun at the end that relied on the protagonist's name being Evan?"

He has Grabbed onto the first offer that comes his way. The plot is bad, and there is no character development. You cant empathize with anyone. He wanders around the whole movie like a little lost puppy who doesn't know his lines.

Its boring and there is no pacing. We turned it off halfway through. I was surprised to learn that this was an eli roth movie. He seems to have more misses than hits these days. Save 2 hours of your life and watch something else."
1.0,26 March 2019,I dont know why reeves accepted to play in this diarrhea for a movie. They must have kidnapped his family or something.

1.0,30 October 2015,"Been reading a lot of reviews on here and a lot of them are saying it's the worst movie they have ever seen... and to that I say, really?

Perhaps people were expecting the typical Eli Roth gore fare extravaganza, and although there are scenes of violence it never does take it to the extreme like Roth's previous works has and that let them down...

Or perhaps they've only seen like 100 movies...

Not saying it's a ""great"" movie by any means but it kept me fairly entertained throughout the watch, even if it was occasionally for the ""wrong reasons"" when scenes are so over the top you can't help but to laugh or smirk...

But as far as erotic thrillers goes, which is what I would classify this as more than as a horror it's not all that bad, it does have a bundle of plot holes and the motives remain quite unclear even after the credits stopped rolling, but most erotic thrillers suffers from that dilemma... And it does have a welcoming dose of dark comedic moments as well

Acting-wise it's... okay, Keanu Reeves tries to do something different with his acting this time, I think that was Eli Roth's idea, he's far more energetic and over the top than we are used to seeing him as, I'm not sure it was the best way to play the role but can't hate on him for trying something different... And considering some of the dialogue he was given, it would be a struggle for even the best of actors to make that sound believable...

But overall all despite it flaws it kept me fairly entertained so I'll slip it a 6/10, even though the ending wasn't all that satisfying"

Unless you've seen every other movie that you think looks interesting and this is the very last option!!!!

Wow!!!

So disappointed! And tired!!!! The acting in the beginning is horrible. Even for Keanu. Even the kids acting is lame. The wife isn't that bad and neither are the psychos. They're mostly just annoying. Most of the movie I just wanted to knock the B out!!!! The Sex is alright -I guess- but just another easy to predict, same old story, frustrating movie that frustrates you the entire time (partly cuz you know it's not gonna get any better yet you continue to watch it lol) and the end leaves you even less satisfied. HORRIBLE!!!"

It played on the nature of cheating, and of revolution/anarchy directed at the1%, disaffected millennial youth blah blah... it was slightly in the realm of a Peckinpah film, which I liked. Almost original in what it tackled. Clean film production, distinct sound track. A step up from some of the more cruel Eli Roth films of yore. I am only writing this because I think the review proceeding me is bizarre and not to be taken too seriously. Oh and the only acting that was questionable was Keanu who really could have done more with his flat shouting monologue.

The film has the overtones that men are powerless when it comes to the law and woman will always have the upper hand.

Knock Knock almost pulls through all the way, except for it's underwhelming and off tune ending, which is a shame. However, it definitely puts the effort in to make this quite a psychological and suspenseful thriller."

I was generally annoyed at the girls in the movie and sadly the only good part was shorter than 2 minutes. I watched this on Popcorn Time but I would've walked out if i paid.

If you want to waste your time, if you want to be annoyed, if you want to be bored or if you just want to watch a terrible movie--my friend-- this is the movie.

But there are so many points in the movie where we are rooting for Evan, hoping he'll be able to escape and exact revenge on these girls, who it seems have done this multiple times before to other men in their sick thrill.....but the movie ends in a very empty, heart-breaking way, making it a total waste of an hour and a half.

I understand the concept of ""Get what you deserve"" but this was not that and I could barely take it. Then I realized how good of a job the movie did with such a simple concept because this is how the husband must of felt x's 10,000. Then came the rest of it. Holy Whatchamacallit. I can't imagine the acting was easy. Probably funny in-between some takes but props to them. It's hard to watch Keanu Reeves get tortured. He's such a good soul. Seriously. I found myself physically recoiling, revolted and angry. Then at the very end I found myself laughing. Tons of stuff they did even by their own 'Justice Logic' didn't make sense but that was the point. They're bonkers.

Eli, if you ever read these reviews, please, your movies suck. They are always totally silly and focused on pointless violence. Excessive, with next to no plot or motive, you're like the test harness for special effects. ""Hey we've invented a new blood pack that explodes - i'll see if Eli Roth can write a movie around it"".

Please, don't waste your time with this movie. How on earth Keanu was persuaded to appear in it with such a pathetic plot i don't know. If it is by Eli Roth, suspend your brain, don't expect anything worth watching to happen. He's become a by word for total junk."
1.0,26 March 2021,"I think everyone that rated this movie poorly expected an Eli Roth film to be grotesque and gory. This is neither. Rather, it was a psychological thriller with a cringe-worthy outcome. The acting is superb...Keanu Reeves shines as do the supporting cast. Well directed and executed. It had my attention from beginning to end, and given my penchant for getting distracted with other things during a horror film, that is a compliment. But...this is NOT horror. I think that is why a lot of people hated it. Eli Roth's name is synonymous with the visually disturbing, so if that is what you are after, skip this one. I think this was his segue into something different, and he totally pulled it off. If you love psych drama this is for you. If you after jump scares and gore, skip it.

After the first hour I thought to myself ""what am I watching?"" Here are the points in which I think you must stay away from this film:

1. Bad acting: This film has a well known actor Keanu Reeves who is good in a lot of films but this film isn't one of them. The two women Lerrenza Izzo and Ana de Arma were worse than him.

2. No story: This film has barely any story or non at all.

3. Bad directing: This film has a well known director Eli Roth but this is probably his worst film yet with really bad camera angles.

Finally I had really high hopes for this film considering some critics said that was Eli Roth's best film since Hostel I one on the hand don't agree. This film is just awful and I don't recommend you watch it 1/10 STAY AWAY! forever."

I truly love ana De armas, she was spectacular in knock knock. Still surprised that it's the same girl who played Marta in knives out!!! & I love her character bell, she's one of the most complex characters I've ever seen. & I love that very much.

We should have gone online to read reviews which had been more fun that watching this hideous excuse for a movie. The whole cast should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves .

1.0,21 July 2017,"Before I start the review, I want to address the concept of horror movies. The idea is that they're supposed to scare us. Some are authentically scary (Psycho, The Shining), while most are kind of silly. Guilty pleasures, if you will.

But every once in a while there comes along a horror movie that leaves one depressed. Depressed at the knowledge that someone decided to bankroll something so awful. Eli Roth's ""Knock Knock"" is one such movie.

I learned of Eli Roth from his collaborations with Quentin Tarantino. Roth directed the Thanksgiving segment of ""Grindhouse"" (Tarantino's collaboration with Robert Rodriguez paying tribute to the B movies of the '70s), and then co-starred in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the Bear Jew (who bashes in the heads of Nazis). When he does that, the results are masterpieces along the lines of ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"". If ""Knock Knock"" is any indication, Roth's own movies are crimes against humanity. The movie itself is one disgusting long exercise in torture porn. Avoid it."
2.0,23 April 2016,"Knock Knock

I'm at a loss for words with this film. Let me see if I can muster up some comparisons. Eli Roth loves to add in foreshadowing into his films. I wish things were not so predictable though, but Eli shows he can really write characters well.

Genesis played by Lorenza Izzo, who was also in Green Inferno, show her range in that she can play both the innocent virgin in Green Inferno and the very definition of Chaotic Evil in Knock Knock.

Bell played by Ana de Armas was seriously crazy. I mean textbook thrown into a vat of melted lead, crazy. I look forward to seeing her performance in War Dogs.

As promised: the comparisons. I think the best comparison for this film is Scream, in that the villains of the movie are seriously messed up in the head and are willing to do the most extreme measures to see to their perfect ending and are truly methodical with how they unfold their diabolic plan.

Ladies, you're gonna hate the first act. Just saying. My wife couldn't make it through the first act. Ann Frank could see what was coming. (Referencing: Clerks II)

Verdict: Watch it. It keeps you wanting to know how it's going to end. Almost like Gone Girl. It didn't end like I thought it would, but everything else was pretty much predictable."

The story is disgusting, the acting terrible, the film extremely uncomfortable and a feeling of being violated afterwards. I genuinely needed a shower after this. Avoid at all costs."
6.0,7 June 2023,"Just like The Purge or Saw series of movies, this movie was dark and Maniacal in it's own way. It was pretty straightforward as far as where you knew it was headed but it never let up for a second.

Devious in the fact that there was virtually no purpose on the choice of victim and Maniacal in all the ways they made him suffer. It made me cringe physically and mentally as these things happened to Reeves. It makes you want to leave society out in the cold and never trust anyone again It did miss a couple of opportunities for plot twist (IMO).

This movie definitely needs sequels, as it left itself wide open for them...as well as a prequel."
1.0,28 June 2015,"Dunno what people were expecting, but the name Eli Roth should be enough to give you an idea of the content/quality. Simple plot: two girls show up at married father Keanu Reeves' door and seduce him while his family is away. They then come back and force him to play A sadistic 'punishment' game. Not that violent, I think the rating may Be more for the swears

Keanu's acting wasn't always convincing, but he did all right,. The girls were good, laughs were mostly intentional and it managed to be consistently entertaining. Enjoyed the ending a lot.

Just go in expecting some trashy fun and you should be well met"
10.0,5 November 2020,"This was number 3 on netflix and when I saw Roth and Reeves names attached to it I thought it would be worth watching, boy was I wrong! I've seen episode's of Scooby Doo that are scary than this. Major plot holes throughout the entire movie and a weak script equals a truly awful movie, there is absolutely no horror aspect at all and I wouldn't even consider this a thriller just generally boring from start to finish. Don't waste your time with this movie."

I understand the message of this film, but it is so awful what is happening. I understand the character obviously let in good looking girls in his home, because so confident of his charm. I am sorry to say but it was typical, this mistake will not do only the sexual predators what Keanu Reeves acting person. Actually he try to speak himself by the good man,but come on You let in people Your own house. You believe totally strangers anything what they say. Just because they were good looking. I know he was sexually frustrated because of the rareness of sex in his marriage. Come on people You let anybody to have sex with You without You know anything of them. It is scary and it is mad. They killed a person who have bad breathing and get the situation quick enough. They leave in him in a living hell, what he can't explain because what they did. The film finishes like anybody can do with anybody that without any jail or something. That makes me very angry. If this could happens it is awful. The film maker should think about it how great idea gives about 2 billion angry young girl to make people sad and live in a living horror. This is a retarded finish is killed the believe Movies for entertaining."

In almost every seen I become outraged wanting to do something and my mind could not accept what that my eyes are seeing I wanted to change the story make it better and in the end I was excited and happy that for me this nightmare was over.. excellent acting and I hope not to see a movie like that in the near future nor in real life:)...

1.0,25 October 2015,"Dear Keanu Reeves, This was the worst movie ever I have watched, I mean the worst, come on mate, I have watched all your movies, and this was so horrible and most of all your acting was also not up to the level because this is not your style mate. I'm very much surprised that the rating is even 5. I was trying to give a zero but 01 is the least level. Please don't ever act in such movies no matter how much they would be willing to pay you because it' not worth it. You're a legend and people love you for your acting so it's not worth anything to act in a crappy movie like this. At least. I mean at least there should be a proper ending (what happened at the end? Did you die??). You may want to give a message to the public but then you could do some other movie not like this, and anyway people see you as a hero, not as a helpless fellow to be buried alive. I'm not blaming the director or the producer because anyway people will never stop making crappy movies and there will be a crappy audience to say good about it, but I'm telling you, please don't take movies of this nature because this is not who you are, you are just putting yourself down. Your fans all around the world like you for the personality that you have created in their mind, so think about your fans before you take up movies like this. This movie was so bad in so many different levels. By the way, not for a second think that I don't understand the movie and what it is trying say (Although how the story was written was a pile of crap), I do but it's just not for you and I'm talking on behalf of all the millions of fans around the world. Thank you."
1.0,28 December 2020,"Keanu playes a happily married man with two kids. One evening he gets seduced by two girls who show up at his door asking for directions. I say seduce but it just looks he really doesn't want it and then it just happens. After this mistake Keanu is uncapable of getting rid of the girls. They overpower him somehow even though are light as a feather compared to Keanu. It then becomes clear they want to expose what he did to his wife and maybe even kill him. Next up, some really bad acting from Keanu trying to act scared, begging for his life and angrily asking why the girls are doing to him.

This movie isn't just torment for the main character but also for you as the viewer. You can't feel much sympathy for the character of Keanu (don't even remember his name). All he did was have a trio while being happily married and then seems incapable of just pushing to girls out his house who are light as a feather. He is weak in so many ways. Should you feel sympathy for the girls? No idea. Maybe they went through some bad things in the past that explain their actions. Maybe they didn't. It's completely unclear why they do what they do in this moviie. There is a hint that there is link between the girls and Keanu but it could also be random. Who nows. So if you watch you're watching some event unfold that feature an incapable main character and two, probably evil, characters that annoy you to the point that you want to stop the movie.

The ending is also one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It's a sort of bad ending and sometimes that works really good. Here you just get a different bad ending then you are suspecting leaving you thinking: WHAT??? THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE LEAVING ME WITH AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF OF ANNOYANCE!!

Well I hope this was helpful. Writing this was helpful for me."
1.0,9 May 2024,"As a fan of both Ana de Armas and Keanu Reeves, the news that ""Knock Knock"" was banned in many countries only heightened my curiosity and desire to watch it. Despite the controversy surrounding its release, I embarked on this cinematic journey with high expectations, eager to uncover what made this film so divisive.

Gripping Thriller that Captivates

""Knock Knock"" wastes no time in grabbing the viewer's attention, plunging them into a tense and suspenseful narrative from the outset. The film's relentless pacing and escalating sense of dread keep audiences on the edge of their seats, eager to unravel the mysteries lurking within its dark corridors.

Engaging Plot Despite Initial Doubts

While initially skeptical of the characters' actions and motivations, I found myself drawn into the intricate web of deceit and betrayal that unfolds throughout the film. Despite its seemingly straightforward premise, ""Knock Knock"" surprises with its unexpected twists and turns, keeping viewers guessing until the very end.

Controversial Themes and Mixed Messages

One of the more contentious aspects of ""Knock Knock"" is its exploration of themes surrounding infidelity and retribution. While I found the film's dark humor and satirical take on the consequences of cheating to be amusing, I couldn't help but feel uneasy about its portrayal of men as inherently unfaithful and deserving of punishment. The film's portrayal of gender dynamics and morality may leave some viewers conflicted and questioning its underlying message. However, it's crucial to remember that anyone can make mistakes in specific circumstances, regardless of gender, emphasizing the importance of equality and understanding in relationships.

In conclusion, ""Knock Knock"" is a gripping thriller that delivers on its promise of action and suspense. While its controversial themes may not sit well with everyone, the film succeeds in keeping audiences entertained and engaged throughout its runtime. Whether it's the captivating performances of its leads or the nail-biting tension of its plot, ""Knock Knock"" is anything but boring. However, for those who may be put off by its controversial subject matter, the allure of Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo's naked bodies may be the only incentive to give this film a chance."
7.0,18 October 2015,"This movie is absolute garbage. No purpose or direction and it features two of the most painfully obnoxious characters (Genesis & Bel) you will ever see on the movie/TV screen. I wish I could get a refund from iTunes. I kept enduring this gawd awful movie ""hoping"" it would get better (plot, sense) and it never did. When it was over...your thought will be about what million others things you could have done in 1:30 mins you just lost. Most movies with annoying characters get that people don't care to watch it for an entire movie. But, Eli Roth in all of his ""genius"" doesn't get no one wants to see annoying/obnoxious characters behavior for an entire movie. I just wanted the scenes to be over because the lead actress just wouldn't stop being ""5 yr old brats""."
1.0,12 August 2017,"PROS: The one pro was how well the movie was built/progressed. There was this constant sense of illuminating fear, and so many wtf moments that you couldn't even grasp at what the characters intentions were, you were just sent on a roller coaster of emotions. This could be really good, but it could also be bad. In this movie in particular it was very interesting. The way the characters changed really highlighted the shear amount of insanity that was taking place. There was no point in the film where I felt easy. I liked that. The music, and the way the film was shot was quite captivating. You could feel that the director had a really good sense of what a psychological horror movie should be.

CONS: A large negative in this movie was the acting. Keanu Reeves, who played EVAN, really had a hard time at grasping the role he was given. The way he moved around the set was nice, but other than that the delivery of his dialogue was very shoddy. The female actors were very OK as well. With the roles that they had there wasn't many limits, and I was frustrated that they stayed in the box as much as they did. The main female actors could've benefited from some sort of back story. You were given so little and that made it hard to understand there intentions on a deeper level. The other thing that was aggravating was the conclusion. It felt very thrown together. I liked the way that it revealed more about the characters, but I also hated how unplanned it felt.

7.0,20 November 2015,"To summarize, I would have preferred to watch 2 girls one cup on repeat for an hour and a half, while listening to nickleback, that is how much I enjoyed the movie, the scenario, the acting. I mean we have been indulging Keanu Reeves with his pseudo-roles for years now, and we've allowed him to act the same way for all his different characters, and we watched him anyway. But this was so terrible that I'm sure he's also crying himself to sleep now. Seriously, I don't understand how it's a 5 on IMDb. I'm even required to write 10 minimum lines about how disappointed I am and I am making this effort hoping you will learn from my mistake. Cheers!"
1.0,14 October 2015,"I rarely give reviews on here but felt i have to give this great film one to try to counteract the bad reviews it has somehow gained from people who always expect a blockbuster and will settle for nothing less, you guys have got it so wrong and need to re-watch it, it's almost like you were watching a different film.

It had me gripped from the start because in my opinion the acting (mainly Keanu) was amazing and convincing, the ending i thought was good even if it wasn't what i thought it would be, but that's what i want from films...unpredictability.

I just want to also add that not all men are the same, i love my partner and have done for 38 years i guarantee no amount of flirting etc would tempt me to cheat, we both look but don't touch and that suits me fine, yes the girls were pretty but to me, my partner is 10 times as pretty and i'm sure there's a lot of men out there who feel the same."

7.0,16 October 2015,"The premise, story line and the acting was amateurish at best and downright disgusting at worst. The entire production unit should be held responsible for this disaster, and confusing the boundary between insanity and morality.

The movie teetered towards the former at the start, and veered towards the latter shortly thereafter. When insane teenagers who don't bat an eyelid about murder start moral-bashing the protagonist without any reason, who then starts behaving like a helpless infant, its asking too much of the audience.

Usually, not one to write reviews, this movie just warrants it. I wasted 2 hours of my life, so that you don't have to."
1.0,26 September 2016,"Okay so I have never written a review for a film before, but this film was that bad I've made an IMDb account just to warn people of how rubbish it is.

For a start, Keanu reeves acting is the most cringe worthy, painful thing I have ever seen. He doesn't change the tone of his voice or his expressions once during this movie. Its like he just could just not be bothered and just needed the money.

The plot is just as bad - a grown man gets outwitted by 2 young girls? I doubt it. And its not like these two young girls were some evil genius's. It just made me root for the girls because of how much of an idiot he was portrayed to be!

The ending. Oh dear. The only reason I watched it till the end because I was sure SOMETHING had to give. It didn't. The ending was a joke and I have wound up annoyed at wasting 2 hours of my precious time on this utter trash film.

So to sum it up, do not even bother with this film - it literally has no redeeming features.

If i could give it 0/10 - I would."

The girls were so overly annoying for the whole movie, and i hope i never see their stupid faces in any film ever again.

The only good character in the movie is the family dog, Monkey.

If you ever think about watching this, save yourself the irritation and DON'T."
7.0,16 July 2016,"The story is not bad and the acting is decent. But in order to like this movie you need to have a dark sense of humor. Some of the storyline was predictable but overall it was not a boring movie, it keeps you engaged and waiting to know what will these to psycho bitches will do next. The girls are cute and sexy and Keanu does a good job acting out his part, although this character should have done a better job at taking care of these crazy girls before they started with the crazy games.

Personally I would have written this story differently and would of added more insight as to why these two girls turned crazy stalkers. The movie needed a bit of more sex would and then some more torturing."

Lame, humdrum, and excruciatingly annoying all the way through the movie. I think the audience for this movie is......? Maybe a college freshman who just got cheated on by her boyfriend and needs to see a therapist about some daddy issues? More than disappointing- it was a waste of time.

8.0,11 October 2015,"This is no 'typical' Eli Roth fare. It builds slow (we're even warned about that in the beginning; both Roth and Evan like building up the anticipation). There's a lot said with images, not dialogue. Like any good film should do. Lots of subtext there - for those who can read it. It's contained. Minimalist. Almost restrained, for Roth. Twisted, dark comedy and underneath that, brilliant, biting satire. Roth and Lopez don't spare anything or anyone. And because of that, reading the audience's reaction in reviews and tweets is about as entertaining as the movie itself. It seems to have hit a few sore spots ;) Also, this movie features what is probably Keanu Reeves' best performance so far. He finally lets loose. So unrestrained, it's beautiful to watch."
7.0,19 October 2015,"Knock Knock. Who's there? The Jew Bear. Jew Bear who? Eli Roth, a director who only cranked out 2 movies (Hostel Part 2 & The Green Inferno) in the last 8 years. So he had plenty of time to think about the script for this movie which he wrote and directed. Turns out the plot is a rather simple one: A fancy architect (Keanu) stays alone in the house to work for the weekend while the wife's away with the kids. On a very rainy night 2 steaming hot girls ring his doorbell (well actually they knock coz otherwise the title wouldn't make much sense innit). He invites them inside where they need to take off their wet clothes and put them in the dryer... If you're reading this and you're thinking to yourself: this seems like the plot of a cheap soft-porn film you're actually partially right. The first 30 mins Keanu tries to stay loyal to his wife while the girls try to get into his pants and eventually he buckles and has a threesome. But as this is a Eli Roth film all hell breaks loose after that. So here the rub: the 'all hell breaking loose' part is very well done. You'll wanna kill these bitches yourself as you'll feel as powerless and frustrated as poor Keanu. So a job well done there Eli. But...all the while you're watching the film you're thinking it's gonna lead up to something but it simply does not and in that sense it's somewhat of a letdown. The film get's a rather unjust low score on IMDb probably because of this. However if you're an Eli Roth fan or you like these rather intense films I would recommend it but maybe this film is not everyone's cup of tea. I found it a good watch and suggest you check it out."

2.0,18 October 2015,"Kudos to Eli Roth for taking a chance on giving us a different type of movie. Did it pay off? well, watch the movie and see what you think.

I don't think a lot of the 'dreadful' reviews on Keanu Reeves' performance are fair. He doesn't really have that much to do.(when you watch it you will understand)

The first act bubbles nicely, then BAM! the craziness ensues. What I enjoyed most about Knock Knock is that it didn't play it safe - you never 100% knew what was going to happen next, which was very refreshing for these home invasion type movies.

The antagonists Genesis and Bel do their jobs as the sexy vixens that make Keanu's life hell - Lorenzo Izzo really shines in her maniacal Heath Ledger Joker-esc performance. A very good villain. This could be her break-out role.

You never really understand their motives for doing what they are doing or why they're targeting Evan (Keanu Reeves) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired, but it still makes for a fun watch, and a lesson to all dudes out there... if 2 hot chicks turn up at your door while your wife and kids are away - just send them on their merry way. :-)"
7.0,12 July 2017,
1.0,14 June 2016,"Intervening moral issues of fidelity and sexual drives (usually, present in married men), Roth, Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo conceive a story with references - or possibly based - on ""Death Game"" film of 1997 with almost the same plot. With better performances, uses of technology, a story with appropriate plot twists and a better directing, this new version shows the multifaceted that could be the director, without the presence gore that characterizes him, OK, at least without so much blood.

With a predictably moderate result at the box office, ""Knock Knock"" is a fresh and lush proposal to the commercial films and while it is not the masterpiece of the season, it is one of the independent films more entertaining of the year. Roth arrives with strength to the suspense genre, with one idea we've already seen, but with a view more modern and modified about itself, perhaps is a remake or maybe not.

Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a happily married architect, father of two children, with fortune, love, DJ hobbies, a beautiful house, in summary an idealized life, what else can he ask for?. Then, his two children and his wife take a nice vacation to the beach - on the occasion of father's day, a big irony-, Evan and Monkey left alone at home working on his project. On a rainy and simply sinister night, two beautiful and stunning girls innocently knock on the Evan's door, under the pretext of help, since they have lost on the way to a party. This merciful man - though, after I watch this movie so many times, in the third time, I can see the desire of Evan, it is logical, he is a man - allows them to enter for one call or maximum one coffee cup. Bel (Ana de Armas) and Genesis (Lorenza Izzo, the wife and constant contributor to Roth) are male sexual fantasy. After asking a taxi and have a talk about faithfulness and sex, things become dangerous and Evan's love for his family is thrown into the toilet.

Evan has sexual relations with the two girls - something relatively impossible considering the age of Evan, but relatively possible considering that morning his wife not wanted help him, affirming that he took more than three months without having sexual relations -, naive and innocent of the hell that was to come. Once the guys begin to show their bad behavior, Evan feels in trouble and goes in a direction that will not help him. Things come up to the limit of gag to Evan, unintentionally killing a person and destroy all the house. The previous is made to give a lesson to all husband who believe to be faithful, but that ""fidelity"" word is what less used inside their mind.

Idea is completely brand-new, however, its end leaves the audience unsatisfied, thrilled and even disappointed. It feels like a failed experiment, feels like a work that had a stupid ending, it is illogical to which after a great development finishes with a finish so poor and cheap in order to show a consequence.

Moral themes is most used in dramatic and thriller films, but the issues touched in this film are substantially used them and share a better connection with the audience due to everyday life and reminiscence of them in life any common man. It is not a feminist film, it is not a male chauvinist film, Roth manages to get that balance of genre in order to do not be wrong about taking his project where it should not go.

Ana de Armas and Lorena Izzo are fabulous in their roles, however, momentarily, they get rid of the psychology and strange behavior that had. The classification R, they gave to the film is opportune, since, in addition to having strong sexual scenes, profanity and violence, these girls transmit horror, a genre that apparently are not visible, but after seeing the work these two women, the horror reincarnated in the beauty. Reeves also makes a great role here, different than what he has done so far, revealing its full potential with his monologue ""free pizza"".

Technological contributions make much with little, recorded in one house with fascinating interior design, Roth knows how to slide his camera through the corridors and walls full of art and paintings, giving a modern twist to a house of a familiar aura.

Last Roth's film- and hopefully it is not the last, really - plays very well exposed moral issues, with photography and cinematography very well executed, but narratively falls short and not in its development, in its empty and simple end."

The movie could be sold as Fatal Attraction for the social media generation but it's really just a trashy chiller with a solid performance from Keanu Reeves at the centre of it.

People seemed to be critical about Mr Reeves' acting skills, I don't understand why, he delivered in John Wick and he delivers in this.

Some of the reviews for Knock Knock have been bad but personally I thought the film was great fun even though I expected it to be more violent than it is.

My only criticism of the film is that I did wonder about the girls' motivations afterwards. Overall I thought Knock Knock was an entertaining watch, plus it has one of those rare things in cinema these days, a great ending."

This is the type of film that you would watch with your friends with a couple of beers and a smoke.

After all the horrible movie is trying to send a message for any man. the message is it is your fault if some pretty chicks tried to seduce you in your own house using your own bathroompretending that it is not their fault either. After all i was disappointed and i will think 100 times before watching Keanu again :("
1.0,13 March 2016,"If your'e going to watch this movie to kill some time, I recommend you rather download new music or water your plants or go out for a walk or call a friend or watch the weather channel or take a nap or a shower or sit down and wonder how the world came to being or listen to your favorite music or clean your cupboard or check your car tires for pressure or play your favorite game or go window shopping or may be just for a drive or browse google maps for places you did not know about or read a new book and polish your shoes or iron your clothes or break something you don't like at home but trust me, do not watch this movie. I wonder what you were thinking Keanu."
1.0,21 January 2016,"What a waste. No horror, no thriller...no acting. Utterly SILLY.That totally sums it up, but, I will continue to write, as the review process requires ten lines or so. While this film would certainly be easy to pick apart scene by boring scene, it is simply not necessary, as this crap film comes apart like a two dollar watch right in front of the poor viewer. One possible use for this sad attempt at film making would be a parlor game of sorts...Push the PLAY button, and the first viewer to look across at the other in amazement gets a point. The first eye roll from a viewer also gains a point. Of course, the only way to win is to lunge across the room and press STOP."
1.0,14 May 2016,"Gawd! I can't believe I just wasted two hours watching this movie and hoping that Keenau Reeves would get back at those two sick bitches! Now I'm wasting my time to try to write a review for this stupid ass movie! There have been a couple of times that the main character had the opportunity to do something about his ""situation""! Even when his friend came over to the house, he knew something was not quite right about the two girls. He didn't even bother to untie Keenau when he discovered him in the other room! Come on, give me a break! And...it made me choke further when the family arrives home to see all the damages to the house and the movie ends there!!! Sheesh!"
6.0,12 October 2015,"Rather amazingly the film has been lambasted in reviews. It is not much, but then again it was never going to be that in this vicinity, so the question is, does it hold together? I would say it does, without needing to muster real excitement or deprecation for the twists and turns of plot.

A happily married man has the house to himself for the weekend, it's a spacious house in the suburbs. Except life conspires to bring two beautiful young girls on his doorstep that night, lost on their way to a party and he takes them in while they wait for a cab.

Things ensue, and you can see it ratcheting up tension of a rather ordinary kind. Something wrong with these girls. Suburban normalcy shattered and something exposed in the pieces; how manipulable a life is. In more competent hands, we'd be asked to entertain that the two girls might have been a hint in the man's mind, the world conspiring to give him what he perhaps thinks about some days. That would require an unreliable narrator.

They settled for vindictive madness, turning the girls into unreliable narrators. Was the blonde one even abused ever? And they could have gone in varied directions, they chose the simplest that can make you wince. He's tied down to a chair. This is the same maker who gave us Hostel years back, except someone being held captive this time is milked primarily for mental torture, the glee of butchering someone's social life while leaving the body intact.

Viewers decrying a lack of ""plot development"" are as usually barking up the wrong tree, saying words out of habit. We do not need ""plot developed"" in this or other films, it is enough to undergo an experience. The drawback here is that we do not experience either with vigor that will shatter our reality (as we do in Texas Chainsaw) or in a particularly interesting way. It's okay.

If you took gleeful pleasure in The Stepfather, you might want to take a look."
1.0,27 December 2015,"I say confusingly god because after watching this movie, I could not tell if the movie was a passable thriller or was just completely god awful. Which I guess could be argued that this is the mark of a god movie because it stays with you for a little bit. Let me get one thing straight however, this is not a good movie. The script is very juvenile at best and downright horrible at worst. There is very little, if any, character development that makes us want to feel something for the characters. We have two attractive women who seduce a devoted father and then torture him because he let them. Yes. That is the entire plot. But there are some true saving graces with this film in it's acting. Say what you will about Keanu Reeves as an actor, this may have been one of his best performances hes given in a long time, only because he is real and gives an honest performance of a man who has been taken hostage in his own home by women who are slightly insane. Director Eli Roth makes use of long takes which is refreshing to see in a medium that has become known for shorter and shorter takes. And the two actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana De Armas, do a decent job with the characters they are given. Again, this is not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but if you look at it from a purely acting standpoint, Knock Knock can be given a little slack."

I had to check to see if the movie had some sort of deeper subliminal message. Nope. Apparently it was not just me who loathed this movie. I can not even comprehend what was going through Eli Ross' mind while producing this. Never have I been so dissatisfied by a movie's ending ever. Do not waste a single second or cent on this film. Absolutely disgraceful."
1.0,31 July 2017,Don't waste your time with this film. I've seen a lot of questionable movies before but this one was just a huge disappointment. I was hoping for a really good thriller and it was basically a build up to a bad porn film. And when it finally got to the more interesting parts (the actual action) it was just terrible scenes with questionable acting. With a super disappointing ending. Save yourself the hassle and just avoid the film.

Granted, Green Inferno starred a handful of unknowns, but Keanu????? I wanted to see a different ending in Knock Knock and a better storyline. Hell, I've seen better on Lifetime. Don't waste your money. You can view Knock Knock free on Putlocker. At least you'll have saved your money. You'll still however, be left scratching your head. I'm scratching my head wondering why I have to submit a minimum amount of text here. Trivia.. the tribe filmed in Green Inferno was a real tribe. I don't think they're real cannibals though.

Many things are overly exaggerated and painful to watch.

This is my first review ever, i had to do it so people can be warned. Biggest let down from Keanu Reeves, avoid this at all costs!If you have a brain this is not for you!

Complete waste of money in the making of this movie."
7.0,5 July 2015,"I mainly enjoyed this film because it is different to your usual ""horror"", although I'd explain this film more of a thriller. There aren't many films that have women as the bad people and I think this worked well. Keanu Reeves acting isn't up too his usual standard which was disappointing but the 2 main females did a good job of acting deranged. The ending could have been better and felt a bit disappointed. It didn't answer any of the questions I had and feel it was a bit of a lazy decision. With the darkness of the film it could have been an awesome ending instead I was left feeling cheated. All in all though it was a decent film with a good twist."

1.0,11 August 2015,"The humor surprises if you can take a distance from it and don't take it every scene too serious.

During and especially after the movie it make me think. Apart from what made these girls so disturbed (because it doesn't add anything extra plus would have kept up the tempo) |I think the girls are right. The sort of prove that every almost every man had his own life-agenda besides taking care for his wife and children.

I do think that men are not clever enough to use their brain at the right moment(excitement makes you stop thinking sober when necessary). Men are more then they would like a victim of their instincts and how older we get how better we understand an hate the fact that we will be less attractive to (healthy) younger woman. That makes us disappointed and fixating too much on girls which are way too young.

Our brains know this, and our instinct denies this..

1.0,19 October 2015,"'KNOCK KNOCK': Four Stars (Out of Five)

The new 'home invasion' torture porn flick, from director Eli Roth. It tells the story of a happily married architect; who's left home alone for the weekend, while his family is on vacation, and is visited by two seductive young women. He later learns that they want sex, as well as a lot more. The movie is a remake, of the 1977 B- movie thriller 'DEATH GAME' (written by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald Ross); this updated screenplay was written by Roth, Guillermo Amoedo and Nicolás López (the same team that also wrote the recent slasher flicks 'AFTER SHOCK' and 'THE GREEN INFERNO'). The film stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo (Roth's wife) and Ana de Armas. It's well made, but not nearly as memorable as Roth's other (more grisly) horror flicks!

Evan Webber (Reeves) is home alone for Father's Day weekend. His wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand), and children, went to the beach; for a planned family vacation. Evan stayed home to nurse an injured shoulder, and catch-up on work. While working, and smoking a little weed, he gets an unexpected visit; from two much younger women, named Genesis (Izzo) and Bel (Armas). The girls have been out in the rain, for apparently quite a while, looking for a party. Evan lets them come in and dry off; as he also calls them a cab. When the two women attempt to seduce Evan, he has a very hard time resisting; and things only get worse from there.

I've never seen 'DEATH GAME'; the two lead actresses from it (Colleen Camp and Sandra Locke), both served as producers on this remake (Camp also plays a small part in this film). I don't know how 'KNOCK KNOCK' compares to it; but I can say, I don't like this film as much as Roth's others. It's nice to see him doing something slightly different though; this is an erotic thriller, with very little violence (Roth's other movies are packed with excessive gore). It also doesn't seem nearly as intentionally humorous, as Roth's other (more gory) features. The femdom aspect of it, is intriguing though; and it's nice to see two psycho female villains (rather then a male one). The acting is decent enough, the story is interesting and Roth's directing is good; the film just isn't that funny, or overly disturbing (compared to Roth's other movies).

6.0,24 September 2016,This film was so Horrorible that I got more enjoyment bang my head in to the wall from how stupid the plot was and how it makes no sense and also how anger it made me. And when people refer to horror movies like Friday the 13th a I know what you did last summer not having plot wait till you see this piece of s**t I mean Jason x was beater then this. it's just that awful here's a few (spoilers) well Keanu is this family man who has to work while his wife and kids go to the beach. now while hes working these two w***e's come in to his house act like like there lost a s**t and then they r**e him I don't care what people say they made him have sex with them. Anyway after that happens they ruin his home and then he drops them home after and then they come back r**e him again and then rec it send it to his wife and bured him up to his neck. All an all if your going to watch this movie my advise is to get so drunk that you through up and you spend the rest of the time in the bath room that by the time your finished the movie will be over and you would've already pass out so that when you wake up you don't remember a thing or you can just not watch it.(up to you) PS. f**k this film.

I picked up on a vibe I think they could have played to make the movie more interesting. The blond gal sneezes (don't give me crap for not naming her, I don't remember Keanu Reeves name in the movie either) and Keanu says ""god bless you"" the girls giggle. I was kind of hoping they were temptresses sent by the devil, and Keanu the proverbial righteous man who would steadfastly resist (even without the demonic part would have been more interesting if he resisted longer, there was more plot tension from that than from them trying to kill him).

Anyway, still a funny romp that went a little overboard at the end, and the lady's motive could have been fleshed out a little (ok a lot) more.

Maybe six stars is a little high, but I have seen much worse movies rated better."
1.0,17 March 2016,"I like Keanu Reeves, not for his acting skills, I know he is a mediocre actor but I always enjoyed his movies. Not this one though.. This movie climbed easily to my top 5 worst movies ever, and I have a very ""hard to beat"" top 5 list. There were moments while watching the movie that I felt awkward, like I was doing something wrong. I never felt this way before. Keanu Reeves should play in movies like matrix that you don't need to actually act, just fighting and staying without any expression for the whole movie. Don't try acting man, you just can't. This movie is a ""never ever watch"" movie. The scenario its like someone got drunk and wrote it in 5 minutes and then another one more drunk than the other, thought to make a movie about it.. Jus"
1.0,19 August 2019,"If the review of my title gave you mixed messages, then the movie will give you plenty of those. But at its core, it's just goofy dark comedy. Don't take it seriously.

At the same time, it's an extremely unsatisfying experience. Frustrating in its lack of focus. The cinematography is beautiful at the beginning but turning into grade B movie very quickly. The acting is wooden yet at the same time believable. The story doesn't make sense yet you want to know what happens next (and like an unsatisfying experience, there is no climax or ending for that matter). The message, is there a message? I really hope the movie doesn't try to deliver any message because those girls are utterly and completely evil. There are no grey areas here.

If the ending was different I would probably have enjoyed this more."

1.0,3 March 2019,"Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo, & Ana de Armas done a very good job together in this movie. Even tho it gave me the chills, it was a very good storyline to this film to let you know not to bring strangers into your home.... They could be really dangerous & and very vicious just like these two girls were in the movie. It would be one of my favorite films I will continue to watch. Excellent job to all 3 of them for making this movie a huge success!"
6.0,28 December 2016,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this movie and quite frankly most are a little bit exaggerated. Obviously, this is not the masterpiece that everyone was waiting for but I did find some strong points.

The main one to me stands on the emotional aspect. It was difficult not feeling some empathy for the guy after some time in the movie. The whole event seemed to be taking place for an eternity and never seems to get a break. After all, he was the ""good"" man who got invaded by hot girls and made that singular error of having some fun with them.

I would guess that this movie tried probably teaching a lesson to unfaithful guys in terms of the 'extreme' consequences he would cause by just having a little bit of fun.

Then most critics say the acting was bad, however I kind of see what the writers wanted to do with the girls in particular. They are clearly deranged and bipolar -; certainly bordering lunacy. Them taking drugs would have been the icing on the cake and would have probably given similar result. Crazy people aren't predictable and that's probably the best result you can get from such people. There was no particular logic to what they were doing other than just screaming and being outrageous at every moment.

At first, you have the impression that they were victims of sexual abuse in their teenage days, or that a boyfriend mistreated them somehow only to discover the whole moral behind their quest which seems to be being the ""superwomen"" that defeat cheating men.

I do admit the delirium into which these girls were at times, made the film unsustainable at times but I tend to believe that this was the effect that the writers were searching for. I think they were really trying to play to the spectators (maybe too much?). Trying to understand the psychology of these girls is extremely complicated. They often navigated between teenage insanity, childish incoherent talk and mature adult craziness. It was complicated to keep track. Ana de Armas clearly had the childish role counterbalanced by her villain associate Lorenza Izzo which I felt had the most maturity.

I feel the movie failed to explain to the spectator the history of these girls and why exactly they were doing that. They touted many times towards pedophilia to a point where one could believe that the family guy had a history concerning that. The movie stayed for the most on the surface and did not look to develop on these girls nor the guy.

The main problem to me regards the fact that nobody still knows up to this date what was the main reason for which these girls crucify guys. The lack of depth does make the movie seem a little bit empty in that regards.

The broad paint with which they painted guys at the end with the ""guys never say no"" is vastly false. There are lots of houses or areas in which people would have never accepted two random girls out of nowhere, especially if the area in which the family guy lives (being an architect), rarely see these kinds of occurrences. His wife did not satisfy him and he just subjectively saw an opportunity to have some pleasure.

I would not call this an atrocious movie. I found myself to be somehow emotionally engaged and for that I'll give it a 6. That's quite generous to say the least but that was the main feeling I had as soon as finished watching the thing."
1.0,6 September 2018,"I'd like to see two silly women get into MY house. This film was DISGUSTING. How a man, or woman, could be this stupid is beyond comprehension.

6.0,14 October 2016,"I must say I was surprised of how bad this movie actually is. The Three main characters are boring, and the ending was very unrealistic. I also wish we would get a little more backstory on the girls. Where did they come from, and why do they act like they do? I also don't like how it seems like the guy is getting blamed when he is actually the victim here. We live in 2016 now, and this wouldn't happen in real life. As i said, very unrealistic. Usually I like open endings, but on this one it didn't feel right. What happened to the girls? And what about the guy?

What I like about the movie though is that, for once, the guy is actually the victim. And I like how he portrays the character, because it feels real, compared to the girls that just seem really bad scripted."

I'm sorry i didn't read the reviews before watching it. IMDb tells me i have to write 10 lines of text for this review but how can you do this after watching such a piece of crap.

1.0,19 December 2015,"Actually, we thought that this movie was actually quite good. Of course because of Reeves playing in it, you expect a great production and cast. It is a SMALL budget production. Very small budget, used the director's house for the filming, which is a large portion of the movie takes place, has only 8 actors/actress + 1 dog in it; 3 main roles, 3 secondary and 2 ""one scene and out"" kind of thing. So you can't be expecting anything grandiose. Now, that being said, and if you are willing to give it a go, you will not be disappointed. The suspense is intense in a jaw dropping way, and Roth DID do a good job in keeping the viewers guessing all the way. Reeves was amazing as always. He took this very challenging role because he never had a go at anything like it and you are not gonna believe he took this role but he did, and there he is, and it is awesome. He definitely was out of his comfort zone and am glad he took a chance because of course; he rocked it. You will see some acting skills of his that you never thought you'd ever see, or thought he had. So if you are a fan of films with intense suspense as well as outside the box kind of stories, this one is for you..... and of course a plus if you're a Keanu Reeves fan !! Enjoy !!"

This film is so so funny, I loved it. The premise is conventional but the hammed up acting makes the delivery a great choice for an early evening halloween movie! ( not for the kids mind you )

Especially the last 20 minutes where the acting when into overdrive and crazy over the top. I watched it with some friends and we were all in stitches laughing and had to play it back a number of times.

Do not watch this movie unless you really hate yourself that much.

But honestly, do not watch this movie. Awful plot, pretty bad acting, irritatingly stupid scenes/lines, and I personally guarantee that you will regret ever seeing it. Knock Knock must have been in the top 5 list for the worst movies of 2015, or even the worst movies ever recorded.

6.0,19 October 2015,"It was my fault, I know I don't like Eli Roth's movies, but as it had Keanu Reeves on it I thought ""It can't be that bad"" ... I was wrong... So wrong!

When a director is bad, the actors are bad as well. Reeves' acting was terrible, he looked like an amateur porn actor.

The plot leads you to Nowhereland. It's predictable and simple, but, as always, Roth tries to force art into a film, which makes it look cheesy and clingy. The lines, along with the acting are just cheap.

The music selection it's quite good, but they ruined it at the end, by using (once again) ""Where is my mind"" by Pixies... There're so many songs, and they chose a song which it's played in so many movies? ... Couldn't they use another song? Liiiike ""Innuendo"" by Queen? It could fit much better."

2.0,10 October 2015,"Eli Roth just came out with a movie earlier this years called the Green Inferno, which featured some of the same actors from that movie. Think I like Knock Knock better, however.

Not as surprising as it sounds, Keanu Reeves stars in this movie. He plays a husband and a father who has to stay home and work on father's day when two hot young chicks come to his door and persuaded him to commit the ultimate male fantasy, that of course turns into his worse nightmare.

The movie goes very extreme in the consequences of being accountable for your actions and leaves you with this incredible ""WTF"" taste in your mouth that truly messes with your head.

Elit Roth's tendency to be very over the top and campy with writing and directing seems to work best when he's being less gory and just destructive with his form of Torture. The movie beats you over the head with it's dumb dialog which adds to the camp and only makes it more amusing, which I'm sure was the point.

Plus, Neo himself was most excellent in this flick. I don't think I've ever seen Reeves act so lively in a film in a long time. He's usually so dry, but he really got into the spirit of the movie. Most Non heinous.

This movie was worth seeing just for the sheer ludicrousness of the whole set-up. You won't be able not to enjoy yourself."
1.0,10 December 2015,"My standard review disclaimer: I never talk about plot in a review enough others do. Rather I discuss a movie's merit or in this case lack thereof. I bought this as a PPV at 8:15 on a Thursday morning, and I'm writing this 1 minute after I've finished watching, at 3:16 p.m. It literally took me 7 hours to get through this pig without being distracted by, say, trimming my eyebrows. Questions: 1. Why, after 30 years has Reeves not perfected his craft? 2. Why has he not made more movies that were ""accidentally"" good. The Lake House had charm. Speed had tension, and The Matrix had, well, everyone else that was IN The Matrix. John Wick was stylistically cool but when I quipped to my friend that I was going to ""look for a good Keanu Reeves movie to watch tonight"", his defense of John Wick over and over was that ""...it's a Keanu movie!"" I realized what he was telling me: he understood my joke of finding a good Reeves movie but even if I'd been serious, such an endeavor would be futile. This movie starts out bad, the scenes with his family have you drowning in sappy syrup. It gets a bit interesting when we are anticipating the antagonist's role and plan for Keanu's character ""Evan"". Then, although the young actresses don't perform poorly, the joke is on us as the movie falls off the edge of the planet. I mean, wow this was bad. Reeves over acts when subtlety is called for, under-acts when he should be pushing a plot device..... it'd be like a writer misspelling every other word or an orator placing emphasis on the wrong syllables every sentence. It's my fault. I made my bed and I laid in it. I should have just gotten up sooner."

I mean the way these girls are acting is perfectly understandable and I can totaly relate to them. Also this poor architect, the whole story put you in some thinking. I would say that getting high and watching this movie is something that I want to live for! :) :) P.s. Make more movies like this and the world will be a better place"
6.0,11 October 2015,never wrote a review before ever like ever but here is goes first thing after watching the entire movie why wasn't the movie complete they should have shown how Evan explain his wife & children and plus he should have at least hurt one of the girls that was shamed he could have done so many things and the plot was so weak after giving them a ride he shouldn't have track them who were them or at least call someone over to this house. in short the plot was so weak this movie shouldn't even rate more than 1 star but acting by the girls were good i didn't expected but they were good. so i liked the movie just it a half complete movie.

Throughout the movie, I got the impression that the entire cast was hamming it up for the cameras. The real reason to watch this is the performance of the blonde Spanish actress. Also love the last scene when Evan Webber's family returns and the son gets the last line. I. Just. Died."
1.0,11 November 2020,Honestly the worst movie I have ever watched. Absolutely no context and just a really horrible movie. If I could give negative stars I would.
7.0,3 July 2016,"The first thing I can say about this movie is I'm glad it's over. I didn't exactly enjoy watching this movie, but this is not the kind of ""glad it's over"" that's result of a really boring, bad movie that mostly made me frustrated. I wanted to see this movie because it is directed by Eli Roth, yet I had no idea it would be this twisted and sick. And when we're talking about horror movies, twisted and sick isn't a bad thing. And the biggest reason for the relief when the closing credits start rolling is the fact that you feel so hopeless during the whole movie. Evan tries his best yet he can't do anything, and all that. While you're watching you think ""Even if he is left alive, how could he ever overcome this"", and all that.

While Knock Knock is just 99 minutes long, the structure is amazing. The film is very slow, yet that 99 minutes doesn't feel too short. The whole situation develops slowly: at first it's seemingly normal, then turns weird, then turns disturbing, then it's just twisted and you experience all kind of feelings in the ""What The F**k"" - spectrum. And that's the most wonderful thing about this film. Every other good technical detail feels kind of blurred after this really f***ed up story in general.

Since this film is a remake, it's hard to say which parts of the writing come from the original movie, and what comes from Roth, López, and Amoedo. The dialogue is good. I always say good things about horror movie dialogue: it's natural. Well, maybe not during the most stressful scenes, but when nothing bad is happening, the dialogue is natural, relaxed, and extremely realistic. Another interesting thing are the few humorous moments. The thing is, their timing makes them so bad. They shouldn't be funny but that's why they make you laugh or at least chuckle: they are so horrible, ironic, whatever is the right word.

There are a lot of weird, awkward moments. One semi-annoying scene was when Bel and Evan discussed music, and Evan talks about how diverse his taste in music is. That's like one, two lines, but it feels like it's the writers patting themselves on the back, because they know weird bands or artists they can use in the movie. While all of that chit chat type of dialogue is quite unnecessary, that felt even more gratuitous.

It's hard to say what score Knock Knock would deserve. I was mostly so disgusted and confused it was hard to concentrate to if this is good in the most objective way possible of reviewing a movie. Thinking about the story, cinematography, and all those little things, Knock Knock is average. A viewer's opinion is mostly affected by how you feel during this film. And you without a doubt feel sick and disgusted or maybe even angry about how a movie like this ruined your night. Well yeah, the writers probably wanted that to happen. I don't think a movie like Knock Knock is made so you can enjoy it, it's a sick, twisted horror movie. It's meant to make you feel negatively, so this film definitely did its job."
1.0,4 December 2020,"Apart from the acting of reeves this whole movie isn't good at all. To be honest generalizing a sterotype, looks like the scriptwriter didn't have the quality to write. The backstory wasn't clear, the story build up was too lame, I think the writer just wanted to give a massage but he/she forgot that u can't spread a message while the storyline is wrong. Totally disappointed. Movies doesn't only about messages it's about the build up of how u r giving it."

This movie is like Eli Roth wanted to film a 3some with Ana de Armas and made a movie around it.

I expected gore or violence (My fault for having these expectations) but honestly nothing happens.

The movie think it's smarter than it is, the acting is god damn awful the direction must have been ok now you girls act horny, now you act crazy ok? CUT! Scenes are 0 believable. Like it's so bad.

Keanu is not good in this and the 2 ladies just act like average horror movie crazy girls.

1.0,15 October 2015,"What a bad movie! it doesn't have a plot, story, dialogue...nothing at all and the whole acting, specially of the two girls is pretty bad!!!! I cannot believe that Keanu Reeves had read the story and said ""oh wow! its a great story, lets do it!"" it must be a lot of money to offer him otherwise I cannot understand why he made such a crappy movie! However, they did pretty well in the product placements, ""UBER"" ""Facebook"" ""Instagram"" but so obvious! It looks like a movie of a bunch of kids with money that decided to invest in a production with a super star. But they didn't make the homework or try to do a good job. My question is how the studios or the distribute companies see in these movie in order to invest on them??"
3.0,11 September 2017,"I actually really enjoyed this little thrill ride of a movie. This is quintessential Eli Roth film making. I think he writes fairly well, but his direction is sometimes lacking. The first third of this film is awkward, directionless, and unnecessary. Keanu was not convincing as a father in these scenes. When the girls showed up, that was when Eli Roth's unique twisted mind did what it does best. The build up of suspense is actually wonderful. The actresses did an excellent job. For me, the sex and nudity is not something I want or need to see, but it just wouldn't be Eli Roth without it I guess. Some good music choices too. Worth checking out if you are into this genre."

2.0,4 January 2016,"I watched ""Knock,Knock"" today. I read mixed reviews. its everyone's own opinion. So here it is starting off the film i was drawn loving dedicated father with a beautiful home wife and kids. Movie picks up quick and gets to the main ""idea"" of the film.. I give this film a 6/10 because the acting is good it has its up's and downs its how you say ""teenage humor"" which is okay. Keanu Reeves does an alright job i felt toward the middle of the film he started to drift away a little bit. ""Lorenza Izzo"" and ""Ana De Armas"" do an excellent job in there roles playing deranged and mental women. I was satisfied with what i watched. This film is definitely at least a rent definitely not worth spending $20, $15 or even $10 dollars. This is a watch though with some friends or even a sleep over watch. It is an average movie with eye openers, ""wows"", laughs, and eye rolling."

Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor and he proved it again and again in every movie he does and this film he shows his incredible acting abilities .the other actors are not really famous but they did a pretty good job.. I read the reviews here and i'm really surprised. It's a brilliant movie. i found the screenplay very fascinating. also the dynamics between the actors is really good and you just feel sucked in easily. This is an horror story film but its almost without blood, its very psychologically attractive and easy to relate to.

9/10 because i didn't enjoy the end."
9.0,20 March 2019,"While not an earth-shattering film, Knock Knock is a light weight thriller that is ideal for a late night binge.

Knock Knock begins with two seemingly innocent, stranded young females appear at Evan's (Keanu Reeves) door. Both women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bell (Ana de Armas) rouse Evan into helping them and quickly take advantage of his hospitality. The vicious young women seduce, blackmail, assault and murder as they continue with their plan. We are left wondering, will Evan also be killed?

While this movie has elements taken from several other films, it achieves its purpose is providing 99 minutes of suspense. Unlike other reviews, I found Keanu a little different than in past films. His performance was understated, certainly a far cry from the action hero we are used to seeing him in. Also, towards the end, there's a scene where Evan is screaming at the girls. I was happy to see Keanu stretch his emotional performance a little more than normal.

Eli Roth put together a solid, well balanced film. A few laughs, a few tears, a few cringes and a lot of - those girls are crazy moments!"
6.0,18 October 2015,"This is the first movie review I have ever bothered to write. I am doing so purely because this creation is so bad it's criminal; I would implore anybody reading this review not to waste 90 minutes of your life watching this abomination. That is time you will never get back, time that could be put to better use watching infomercials - they would have a stronger plot and more engaging characters.

Speaking of plots, it was so weak it had me lurching between two polar states of either uncontrollable ridicule or seething rage. The flaws were endless, so plentiful in fact that I felt compelled to keep watching to make absolutely sure that the utter nonsense unfolding before my burning retina was not going get any better. Needless to say, it didn't.

All that said, the plot was by far and away not the most offensive aspect of the whole sorry episode, oh no. The acting I was witnessing had me blinking in disbelief; it is no exaggeration to say that I've seen more convincing, skillful performances by naive children in nativity plays. Keanu was at his dismal worst, fighting to inject some believability into the situation; however his efforts were completely and utterly nullified by a duo of the worst 'actresses' ever to offend my eyes. With utter disdain I gritted my teeth through their hackneyed delivery of horrendous 'performances'. It occurred to me at one point that they were actually getting paid for this assault on the acting profession and a little bit of vomit involuntarily entered my mouth. Both of them managed to compete constantly for the dubious honour of the 'World's Most Clichéd Acting Style'. Both managed to deliver entirely unconvincing performances that should be instantly forgotten but unfortunately are now etched into my brain in slow motion like a harrowing train wreck. I'm convinced they watched the 10 cheesiest thriller/suspense movies of all time and set out to beat them all for a lack of originality, believability and depth of character.

Having said all of that, I am literally baffled as to why Keanu agreed to do this movie.

In short I have three recommendations for this attempt at a movie. I like to call them the 3 A's....

Avoid.

Avoid.

Avoid."

1.0,10 October 2015,"Having seen the trailer, and having been a (former) fan of Keanu Reeves, I was looking forward to the film.

As it started, I thought for a second that it was not the thriller that was advertised, but maybe a tongue-in-cheek goof film.

I was wrong...very wrong.

This ranks among the worst films I have ever wasted and hour and a half on. The story could have had some merit IF there were any trained actors in it...oh wait, there was...but you would never know it. I thought I was watching a poorly directed high school play.

I realize that when actors become big enough they sometimes get the urge to try out experimental ideas (al la Johnny Deep)...but this experiment was a dismal failure.

Still I would have expected that actor with the talent of Mr. Reeves would have at least TRIED to earn his (I am assuming) very large pay check. But alas, he did not.

Maybe he was experimenting with the idea of NOT acting in a film.

I gave it one star because you have to give it at least one to write a review and I felt it was my responsibility to warn humanity to avoid this horrible waste."

The ending was terrible, at least put a good ending on this story. The plot never went anywhere and his character was to much of a wimp. better luck next time. It had just gotten so ridiculous there was no way out of it. At the end of the movie My husband was so mad that they ended it this way and we had sat here and wasted our time. I think writers think they they have to do a different ending than the traditional happy ending and they end up ruining the movie. It could have been good but was not."
1.0,16 November 2015,"Home alone for the weekend, a devoted husband and father gets an unexpected visit from two beautiful young girls needing help. But what seems like a harmless encounter quickly spirals out of control once he finds himself seduced into their twisted violent games.

Inspired by the infamous 1977 exploitation flick Death Game, Eli Roth returns to the scene as co-writer and director, taking a modernized stab at the classic home invasion subgenre. But was his 8-year directing hiatus worth the wait? Well I'd like to think so! Knock Knock may not feature Roth's signature gore, but most audiences are sure to be disgusted all the same from his strange erotic approach to the psychological thriller. I was actually pleasantly surprised to see such a mature and sophisticated direction coming from this controversial horror director. Some of his die-hard fans will probably feel differently about this change of style, but you have to respect his willingness to try something new. Gore just for the sake of gore, or as they say to create ""shock value,"" has never really impressed me, and this is why I have never been too keen on most of his earlier films. But Knock Knock succeeds in ways his directorial debut Cabin Fever or the god-awful Hostel: Part II didn't by delivering genuine suspense through convincing characters. This is the same clever style he once carried through the original Hostel, minus the excessive bloodshed, of course.

As Ana De Armas previously stated in an interview, it's really interesting to see a story that involves characters that all think they're the victims, regardless of their actions. Knock Knock definitely cuts against the grain in this way by challenging us to question the morality of who's truly innocent. This quickly skews any certainties one may have towards the characters, which eventually leads to an intriguing ethical dilemma. Obviously the actors themselves played a big part in the fierce tension brought to the screen through their exceptional performances. Hilariously enough, one reviewer stated that Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas' acting made them want to knit their eyelids shut. All right buddy Let's maybe take a chill pill and turn it down a notch. I've watched my share of dull movies and Knock Knock is far from one of them. Sure, the film might fall victim to a few minor plot holes, but none came close to distracting from the genuine suspense these characters create. The two lead femme fatales, far from conventional, offered some truly convincing over-the top performances through their psychotic actions and dark campy undertones. Keanu Reeves also delivers what may just be the best performance of his career as the easy-going family man who's forced to deal with a very destructive situation. Providing an impressive range of emotional depth that perfectly contrasts with the sociopathic personalities of the two young sexual vixens.

More importantly, the film manages to shed some interesting light on social media and its disturbingly adverse potential. Most people wouldn't think twice about putting themselves online, but are completely oblivious to the lack of privacy of sites like Facebook. It's so easy to get sucked into socializing digitally in today's age, and I think we've gotten so used to it that most have forgotten how easily its power could be abused. Like it or not, we now live in a time where our personal business can be exposed to the entire world in a matter of seconds. In the wrong hands, this could easily become our worst nightmare. Roth resourcefully uses this nightmare to the film's advantage, creating a disturbingly brilliant form of social commentary that underlines this slick seductive thriller."
8.0,5 November 2015,"The title says it all, plus awful forced acting. A porno that never gets to the point, I feel for Reeves, he's no Brando, but he seems to be in a role that is way to uncomfortable for him. The rest of the cast is lackluster and directing and editing a joke. Besides all this, I don't not understand the reason for Roth to use the same mediocre company of actors (including his wife) in all his film. Really do not bother with this crap. Poorly written, poorly executed. Awful Do not go watch it in theaters, do not VOD it, do not rent it or illegally download it. It's utter manure!!! Roth wife sucks awfully! Spare yourselves the trouble!!!"
7.0,23 October 2015,"The quality of this movie may not be top notch. although I certainly disagree with many others on here that say it was poor. The acting was good and I thought Keanu was very good as well.

(possible Spoilers) The movie starts with a lovely tone, seeing the happy family and a pretty great Keanu as a a loving father. He is alone for a few days working on a project. Then he gets a visit from two girls, they need help and he is a nice guy so he helps them, they then completely abuse his giving nature and ultimately trap him and end up doing all kinds of horrible things to him and the house.

What truly makes this movie horrific is the fact it seems rather real and it seems like it actually could happen. As a guy this movie terrified me. I even paused it because I was so frustrated at one point.

This movie works with the real horror of powerlessness and injustice. There is no supernatural monster out to kill you, there is no zombie Apocalypse. I was not happy watching the movie, but i do think it is good. Especially considering it is truly a horrific premise."
1.0,26 November 2020,"No this isn't a great movie, but it is entertaining from beginning to end. I was fully invested. It made me ask myself a lot of questions as great art should. Just take the movie for what it is and don't take it too seriously. Just be faithful even if two beautiful women just show up at your door. Stay faithful and be loyal. That's what I got from the movie. The cast is amazing and I really felt for the characters. Eli Roth has a very weird filmography, but I've never seen a boring Eli Roth movie.

Check the movie out. I was surprised to seeing people finally find it. Its a fun erotic thriller, not the best and certainly not the worst, but its worth checking out. Louis is the best character in the movie though. HAD ME WEAK!"

When Karen travels with their children to a house by the beach, Evan stays at home since he is very busy in his work. During the stormy night, two young women knock on his door asking for help since they are lost. Evan invites Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) to come in his comfortable house and asks for a taxi to them. They start a conversation and soon they seduce Evan that has sex with them. On the next morning, Evan finds the girls in the kitchen and realizes that they are deranged punks and they want to punish him for cheating his wife.

""Knock Knock"" is a film with a moralist and feminist violent story. The plot recalls Michael Haneke's ""Funny Games"" (1997), with the girls trashing Evan's house and torturing him. The story forgets Louis and the conclusion is funny when the boy says that daddy gave a party when he sees the house totally destroyed. My vote is three.

1.0,9 October 2015,"Where should i even begin with this review. I swear there is so much to say about this film and Roth's films in general. The film begins with an establishing shot of a beautiful home, the only character in this film that Roth choose to give development or depth to. From there we view Our main protagonist and his family. Cozy, loving idyllic, a happy family. And from there are movie begins... We are introduced to the femme fatals. Our antagonists. Or are they simply are voice of reason... The films conscious. This is the way Roth presents it... He allows us to view and justly decide if our protagonists is guilty or deserving of the torture he endures throughout the film. As someone who really does not care much for Eli Roth or his films... I feel i am being a little harsh with my rating. If you are a fan of his work and style of writing then you will have a much better time with this film than i did. My problems with Roth lie in storytelling. Visually he can create and guide us through an eerie hallway or cannibalistic rain forest. But when it comes to character development or dialogue he fails utterly in that department. Overall, Knock, Knock was a film i was eager to see after first glance of the trailer... Now its a movie i'm eagerly trying to forget."
10.0,16 January 2017,"Having seen some of the very many overexcited reviews/rants on this film, a couple of things first, Reeves, who I don't particularly like is fine in this and Roth has directed it brilliantly. It may be slightly overlong but that's not the problem. The problem and what I would really like to know the answer to is what was Roth's point. He was involved in the writing and producing as well as the directing so it is fair to aim this his way. The main thrust is that within the film Reeve's participation in the girls' seduction means he doesn't really love his family and deserves all he gets for his 'violation'. This seems so ludicrous that another possibility appears possible and that is that Roth has contrived this piece to illustrate how easy it is these days for everything to appear to be the guy's fault when often it is not. Recent overdue protection for raped women and abused children could be faulted for bringing about a situation where women can exploit matters. But why would they? Much derision over the film and more surprisingly a large number who find it hilarious. I didn't smile too often, but it remains a well made and provocative film. Just difficult to enjoy."

Its not like the kind of thriller that you would think it would be, its the kind of movie that shows how deranged people can be and how a mans life and come to an end. It works as a cringe comp rather then a Thriller or Horror it advertises it to be. Keanu Reeves did an OK job il say, but i think the Props go to Lorenza Izzo as ""Genesis"". Ana De Armas did good too but i feel like this isn't the roll she was meant to play (i've seen some of her past work).

I did sit through the whole thing and now I do NEED a revenge sequel. It would only be fair. Did I mention I hate this movie??? I can sit through a lot of horrible movies, but I'd rather see a movie that is just bad because it lacks budget than seeing a movie that infuriates me because of other things. I hate the girls.

The trailer promised some intrigue and maybe a different type of movie, (which we all know is much needed these days). I am a ""somewhat"" fan of Keanu Reeves so I was willing to take a chance but, like all of his latest movies, his parts to play are questionable and I don't know whether to blame his acting or the writers for the crap he's been involved in. This one, by far, is the worst. So many unrealistic situations where any 110 lb nerd could defend himself but Keanu just can't muster the testosterone to get it done. Everyone involved in this movie should be ashamed of the product they put out to torture us with. The ending was especially bad.

Adding to the frustration is that some of the participants in the production are capable of making good movies. In fact, the set design and much of the cinematography is quite good for what I assume must have been a low budget. But the writers (including Eli Roth) and the director (Eli Roth) insult the viewers with scene after scene of outrageously ridiculous plit elements coupled with painfully awkward acting. Even Keanu Reeves struggles to avoid ludicrousness in several scenes. I wonder if he pushed back against the direction of the story, or just suffered through it aimlessly and cashed the check?"

This could be the worst film I've ever watched - bad storyline, bad directing, bad acting but....on the upside, from a production point of view, it must have been cheap to make so wouldn't have cost Keanu much at all.....

I've watched a couple of not very impressive KR's films recently - John Wick, 47 Ronin and I think, after this one, I'm wondering more and more whether he's grasping at straws and, instead, perhaps needs to step back and examine a) what he decides to do a bit more closely and b) when he does decide to take part in a movie, tries a bit harder...."

He played the part of a normal guy turned victim by two psycho gals really well. Never thought I'd see him as a helpless victim screaming for his life because he's usually not that guy. Brave of him to take this role while trying to get his career moving again. Don't expect him to be the hero here which is why the story kept me on my toes. There is lots of complaints about how its not real enough. Cmon its a movie, if you want reality, better off looking out your window. Otherwise sit back and get thrilled."

There are so many flaws and so many holes - why they even bothered is beyond me. Everyone including Keanu does the best they can but the mind boggles on why they even tried - it's as if they were the ones under siege having to act in inappropriate circumstances. Avoid, then come back to it in 30 years but I'm not sure that will improve it enough, a strange combination of terrible dialogue, plot and budget - Keanu ca do so much better so it does beg the question - what favour did he owe in order to do this movie, it must have been a big one.

First of all,this movie was bad in a way I can't really describe,after watching it I literally thought about what to feel.

*Spoiler alert* Seeing one of my favorite actors,Keanu Reeves,the awesome John Wick,being defeated by two teenage girls felt kinda wrong.This movie has somehow become one of my most hated ones.Evan had a lot of opportunities to overpower the two girls,but instead he became the exact opposite of John Wick.I didn't really know what I've expected from this movie,but it turns out I wanted too much.

As a conclusion I would say this is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. P.s:The ""sex scenes"" were almost the only reason why I gave it a 2."

Another movie that comes to mind is Dead Poets Society. I know this is a weird movie to compare to Knock Knock, but it's the same principal. The first half of the movie is uplifting and wholesome, and the second half of the movie is a downer and unhealthy.

I get this movie is supposed to be disturbing. But the girls have no backstory. At least with movies like Girl House, which I found less disturbing than this movie, they gave a backstory of why the dude wanted to kill girls.

This movie gives no backstory; the movie just shows the girls are insane. This is bad for the movie and bad for the viewers. Its movies like this why there are more school shooters that are girls these days.

It's not right to glorify needless violence without reason. I find this movie to be a fapfest for misandrists."

Unfortunately. although next morning Keanu's character wakes up to reality the film doesn't. By the time the girls returned I had lost interest and went to bed.

2.0,15 October 2024,"*Knock Knock* (2015), directed by Eli Roth, is a psychological thriller that mixes elements of home invasion horror with moral and ethical dilemmas, but ultimately falls short of delivering on its intriguing premise. The film stars Keanu Reeves as Evan, a devoted husband and father who finds himself in a nightmarish situation when two mysterious women, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas), show up at his door during a stormy night, leading to a dangerous game of seduction and manipulation.

The film plays on the fear of moral failure, exploring the consequences of infidelity in a way that initially feels tense and uncomfortable. Keanu Reeves delivers a performance that ranges from charming and sympathetic to unhinged as Evan becomes increasingly trapped by the two women, whose motivations seem to be both revenge-driven and chaotic.

The performances by Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas are engaging; they bring a blend of seductive menace and unpredictability to their roles, keeping viewers on edge. Their interactions with Reeves' character drive the suspense as the film escalates from temptation to full-blown psychological torment. However, the script fails to provide them with the depth or nuance needed to elevate the film beyond surface-level thrills.

Where *Knock Knock* falters is in its tonal inconsistency and the lack of a truly satisfying resolution. The film struggles to maintain a balance between black comedy, psychological horror, and social commentary, often veering into campiness. The final act, in particular, feels rushed and overly exaggerated, leaving audiences with more frustration than fear or introspection.

Eli Roth's direction is effective in maintaining suspense, and the film's minimalist setting helps to amplify the claustrophobia of the situation. However, *Knock Knock* often feels more like an exercise in shock value than a coherent narrative with a clear point.

Overall, *Knock Knock* is a provocative and sleek thriller with some entertaining moments, but it ultimately lacks the emotional and psychological depth to leave a lasting impact. While it's an interesting exploration of guilt and consequence, its uneven tone and unsatisfying conclusion leave it as a middling entry in the home invasion subgenre."

8.0,2 November 2020,"Went into this one blind. I was thinking, Keanu and Ana de Armas... ay I like both of their acting, I like scary movies, I knew nothing of the movie, and glad for it.

There is something to note while watching: I watched on a quality pair of headphones and have my equalizer set for movies and was disappointed with the sound mixing. With a storm beating down on the house for much of the movie, and with the movies later ominous tone, there wasnt much punch to anything. The only positives were the soundtrack. But the mixing for literally everything else was pretty flat and unimpressive.

Guy finds two sexy girls drenched on his doorstep from a storm. They make sexy time, and when Keanu wakes up in the morning, he finds the girls destroying his kitchen. Things get much worse for Keanu throughout.

This was just an overall good movie, with some questionable acting. Not much to say about the cinematography, but the design of the house was nice.

Not knowing anything about the story, the peppering in of things that make you question where the twist(s) will be coming. Unfortunately, they really dont, which is one of the movies bigger flaws.

The girls constant giggling gets quickly annoying, but when they actually act they do a good job.

I found the first few scenes with the family kind of unbearable. Bit overacted and kind of cringey.

However, after the family leave the tone completely changes. A chilling plot with a great build up.

I can say I've seen a fair few movies over the last couple of years (I do lyk muh movies) and very few have had me on the edge of my seat like this one.

I'm a little curious about the other reviews left on this film... I'm sceptical as to what their real reason is for disliking this film so much.

I hope it's not to do with the fact that two women rape, restrain, murder/manslaughter their way through this man's home? And how that might not fit their narrative? It may well not be, but women can be sociopaths too."

It's John Travolta in ""Battlefield Earth"" bad...

If you look at the 11000 IMDb user ratings split, there is a miraculous 1020 people who rated it 10/10. Uh-huh. If you remove those, the average goes down to 4.3 - which is still a massive overrating for such a diabolically bad film. There are almost no ratings between 6 and, all the others are 5 or lower. This is a movie company fix, 100%. 1000 10/10's massively increase the statistical mean, and boy do they know it... And now, the savaging...

The story is threadbare, the script woeful, Keanu is really scraping the bottom of his very limited range in terms of acting, energy, delivery... (And lets be perfectly honest, he can only ever play one character - and it doesn't work here in the slightest...). There is nothing original, no reason, I just don't even understand how this could have been made - unless Mr Reeves is being blackmailed or lost a bet... its so damn bad a lot of smurf accounts have clearly ramped up the scores and written some truly fake reviews.

It lacks any form of merit, ANY. It was based on a 1977 film which despite being based on a real story, is also not very good; I promise you - this is a whole world worse than anything else you will see this year; possibly ever... Keanu no longer has a career, unless he can pull another Matrix out his backside; he is toast.

If you go to the cinema now you get dross like this, when will they ever learn how to make money? In recent years most cinemas didn't bother with the potentially bankable Maniac, No One Lives, and Human Centipede. As a matter of fact this starts off like Human Centipede does, which is the biggest insult possible to the brilliant HC. Actresses who think slippers, wedges and woolly socks are sexy, camera staff who don't know where to point the camera, questionable sex which is so fast and distorted it is somewhere between boring and unwatchable, very little gore, and a shower scene which is a bad boring joke, that's what you get here. Any adult ratings must have been self-certified, and it is difficult to believe this is the Eli Roth who Directed Cabin Fever and Hostel. He badly needs a course in Camera and calling himself Eli is an insult to Let The Right One In. I can't think of a bigger turnoff than being physically abused by two unsexy actresses, or having to watch them from a theatre circle for that matter.

Anyway, I will suggest this movie to anyone who likes real thrillers, suggestions of terror, cute people, sexual innuendos and well some body shots.

Im going to get straight to the point. This movie is so awful, it does not have any meaning. Its so boring and it was a waste of time. I was seeing the rates here before i went to the cinema and made a wrong decision to watch 'knock knock' than 'the witch hunter', the rates for knock knock was higher than the witch hunter and the description of the movie sounds interesting, so i was more determined to watched it. But turns out not as what mostly everyone expected.

1.0,22 October 2015,"I am convinced that Keanu Reeves must have been held hostage to not only act in this film but to Executive Produce. Perhaps Eli Roth and his young wife (annoying chick with dark hair) drugged poor Keanu to this garbage.

He must have also been drugged to give the worst performance of his career. Who the heck are the people in this film? They are all the worst actors I have ever scene and all appear to be related somehow. (Even the Uber driver is in all the same films as one of the crazy girls)

Sometimes the movie turns to be surprisingly good, sometimes it is sooo bad, that it is sort of funny again, but in some cases it is just as the reviews clearly pointed out - 100% unwatchable!!! Without the slightest doubt ""Knock Knock"" falls in the third category.

Hands down, I barely made it through the first 10 minutes. Heavily loaded with cliché and abysmal acting. Plain torture. And no, it wouldn't get any better, but worse and worse! Those 40 minutes I watched of this piece of incredibly awful directing and acting, felt like 4 hours the least - almost like eternity.

It is really thaaat baaaaad... It's shocking! Honestly speaking, I cannot imagine anyone who actually made it through the whole thing. Maybe if you are a complete masochist, but otherwise there is absolutely no chance. Try it yourself. And find out.

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, that Knock Knock is one of the worst movies ever made. And a 5.0 rating (by the time of writing) can only be a bad joke... It does not even deserve a single star. All copies should be destroyed immediately to erase this disgrace from movie history."

I have no time to watch movie often and the feeling i get after watch this movie i got total ripped off by that low grade movie. Strongly recommend not to watch this movie. Craziest ever. How come two strong guys cannot be able to control two crazy bitches. I wish i could rate -10 for this movie. Will remember this director and never to watch any of his movie again. Cheap, low grade, very inappropriate for minors, waste of time watching this, craziest plot. This kind of movie should never ever come to market. I am very surprised this movie still hold 5 point rating out of ten. What it deserves is -10."

2.0,11 October 2015,"""How the mighty have fallen"" would be the perfect phrase to describe Keanu Reeves' movie roles these days. From the ultimate height of his glory starring in the ground-breaking Matrix movies to the present lacklustre range, that makes one really wonder if this is the same actor who was so highly sought after in the early 90's. I was not a fan of ""John Wick"". In fact, I thought it was a pile of ..... So I was not too surprised at how bad ""Knock Knock"" was. The worst part of the movie was Reeves' outburst. If there was ever a lowest moment in his career, this was it. It is very sad to see such a popular actor descend into such roles as this. It really makes me wonder if he is doing it for the money, or whether his Manager is stringing him up. Don't waste your time on this pile of .... life is too short."
1.0,11 October 2015,"I gave this Movie 9 out of 10 not because of the acting or the movie in it self, not that good. But simply because of the story. After i saw the movie, I was thinking damn..it really touched me, what would I do in the same situation, when I was the lead character. I am in the same situation Love my wife and my kids, and would not cheat for anything, but but...when girls like that came to my House, could I say no. think not, Like the girls said in the Movie ""we are all animals, and it is just Sex"" it is like a need! So great great movie, and lot of new thinking. Eli Roth once again created a super movie,See it- it is both haunting,creepy and funny."
1.0,18 October 2015,"Keanu Reeves has only one character depth so asking him to play something outside of that was pretty desperate. His doting father was way over the top and most kids would have run from him screaming 'my father is a dork'. In fact, the best actors in this whole movie were the two kids and the dog.

Keanu really needs to stick to his monosyllabic roles such as John Wick, John Constantine and Neo. As soon as he tries to stretch his repertoire of characters, it comes off as really false.

As to the story, what a pile of steaming dog poo. The direction was awful, the acting terrible and the storyline stunk to high heaven. The only saving thing in the whole movie was that Reeves ended up buried up to his neck in dirt, a situation that he should get used to if he signs up for any more garbage like this.

Finally, just what did these two stupid girls think was going to happen once they did all this damage? Did they really think that they would get away with it? That is perhaps the single most stupid thing about the whole movie. There is no reason for their actions and there is simply no way that they would get away with it. Did they think that the film of them shagging would stop someone pursuing a prosecution, hell, it is evidence not a deterrent."
1.0,17 October 2015,I wasted one and half hour waiting for something reasonable happens to people who reviewed this move before. I AM SO SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T READ YOUR REVIEWS BEFORE WATCHING THIS MOVIE. five is too much for it maybe 2 or 3 it always happens when writer director and producer are one person with no idea. not about making movies but the life and humans. how did he change to a wild man and steeped with them to morning and had multiple times of sex with them? i believe everyone knows that none of these in this movie are real. weak story could not give us the reason why he could not escape while hide and seek. why his friend instead of untie him tries to save the statue!!!!! what did he wanted to do with weapon since his hands were tied behind. the video they captured was an obvious kidnapping and no one cares to call police it was so hard to write 10 lines about this movie
1.0,11 October 2015,"This was a complete waste of time!!! I would not recommend this movie to anyone, you wouldn't even recommend it to your worst enemy. We only watched the movie thinking that Keanu would never act in a bad movie OR co produce something that was not a good watch, oh were we surprised. The plot sucks!!! Two teenage girls manage to seduce a 43 year old. The girls obviously have issues, but seriously, this could have been scripted better. Keanu plays a absolute wimp and there are so many times he can sort out his situation, but doesn't and cant fight two stupid teenage girls. Is Keanu desperate for movies or some 'action', why else would you act in and produce such garbage!! The movie get's a 1 from me, purely because of Monkey, otherwise I would have rated it a 0."
1.0,18 October 2015,"""being monogamous is not natural ... by doing so you are going against your very nature"". This entire movie is a twisted, penis hating mind flick of an attempt to urinate on the preceding quote from the movie.

According to this movie; a gentleman, committed father and husband with no inclination to be unfaithful - who gets ambushed and seduced by two attractive stalker sociopaths deserves to have his life and the life of his family destroyed... huh?

Worldwide Box Office is unlikely to crack $5 million. Thankfully this vacuous usurper-of-people's-time bombed and hemorrhaged millions of dollars. Those responsible for infecting society with this offensive piece of filth need to be dis-empowered."

1.0,20 October 2015,"This isn't a movie for everyone, if you're expecting a gory Roth movie then this isn't it, nor is it the violent movies we tend to see of Keanu Reeves.

This movie is pretty much a sexual version of Hard Candy. Reeves' acting isn't great in this but it is beautifully shot, has a great story and has a modern twist to the torture theme.

This movies has gotten a lot of hate and I have no idea why, maybe the names Eli Roth and Keanu Reeves made people expect something different from this. Roth has been going down hill with Clown and Aftershock, this is something new and hoping Roth keeps this kind of up."

3.0,10 October 2015,"I have not seen the 'original' film Knock Knock is a remake of, 'Death Game', so I can't do a 1:1 comparison but after Eli Roth's film I'm not even sure I want to give it a look for fear that it is as dreadfully and mindbogglingly bad.

Knock Knock is the story of family man Evan, played with typical woodenness by Keanu Reeves, who invites a duo of rain soaked hotties into his home to wait for a cab and winds up having sex with them and ultimately becoming their prisoner.

Once the setup has been established, we endear a procession of obnoxious behavior from his captors and some seriously milquetoast psychological and physical torture. While Roth enjoys a somewhat misplaced reputation as a goremeister, Knock Knock's assault on Reeve's 'victim' probably wouldn't even stir the squeamish.

Probably the most effective portions of the film come in the first act, and there it is the 'uncomfortable' social awkwardness of Reeves as his interaction with the girls becomes progressively more sexual that registers the loudest. Not exactly the stuff of horror.

The 'plot', if you want to call it that, has pretty much already been blown here with the two breaks already described. There is an ending, of course, and it could have been more effective had Roth succeeded in producing some actual suspense, but as it stands it delivers as just as much of a ripoff as the rest of the film.

Knock Knock is firmly situated in the 'Home Invasion' sub-genre of horror and honestly it's a lot more embarrassing of movie when held in the same company as Ils, The Strangers, or You're Next to name a few.

Remember when Eli Roth was the savior of horror? Those days are long gone now. With Knock Knock and his other recent release Green Inferno Roth has shown that he can't produce scares, he can't produce atmosphere, can't produce suspense, and can't produce story. Even though his earlier films succeeded in some of these columns, that success was not sufficient to elevate him from being a 'promising' talent; Knock Knock proves that this evaluation seriously overestimated Roth's potential."

5.0,23 September 2022,"What a B rated piece of garbage. Did Keanu Reeves lose a bet or did he completely lose his mind to make this pathetic excuse for a movie? It's disgusting; a complete disgrace. He should be ashamed of himself. He should spend whatever amount of money necessary to destroy every copy of this horrible movie. Like all terrible movies, the plot line is completely predictable, the acting is extremely poor and formulaic and from beginning to end I could tell you exactly what was going to happen in the next scene. This type of garbage has been done so many times, over and over again, it is ridiculous that someone felt the need to do it again. What's completely laughable is that within this horrible movie, they play the same horrible scene over several times. They couldn't even come up with an hour and a half worth of awful movie. They could only think of about 15 minutes worth and then put it on repeat for an hour and a half to waste everyone's time. Disgusting."

1.0,26 October 2015,"The joke among horror and film buffs is that Eli Roth is not a great film maker. Not having seen many of his movies, we could never really attest to that fact. If Knock Knock is any indication of his talents as a writer or director then we might have to believe the naysayers.

Keanu Reeves plays Evan, a loving and caring husband who is left alone for a long weekend to work while his wife and two children take a mini-holiday away. Two women knock on his door in the middle of the night, they are lost and soaking wet and need help. Ever the kind man, he lets them into his home, but what was initially a good- natured action turns into a game of dangerous seduction.

There really is no way to put this nicely, so I will put it bluntly: Knock Knock is a poor movie, even a bad one. It seems however that most of the responsibility for the substandard execution should fall on the director's shoulders.

Right off the bat, the acting in Knock Knock is awkwardly bad. The dialogue is drawn out in an unnatural manner for real conversation, and the interactions are pointless. Almost any subject our key players talk about could easily be interchanged for something else with no repercussion on the remainder of the film. With no merit to the dialogue, there is no hope for the characters or narrative to feel like it is evolving, and that is bad writing. This is clear by Evan's two female tormentors coming across more as annoying brats than twisted sociopaths.

Sometimes slow pacing works in a film, because it builds tension and sets a longstanding tone for the film, creating a mood that captivates the audience. Knock Knock is not that type of film, and while slow, it completely misses the mark in creating anything, let alone tension. This film could have been some creepy horror version of Wild Things or even a version of Hard Candy, instead it is nothing of merit.

This whole review may sound harsh, but considering I went into this film open minded and completely without expectation and had such an adverse reaction to it, I think it is justified. Knock Knock is goofy, no scary and the only time I had any reaction to the film was with Louis's line ""Bitch, I am from Oakland.""

9.0,26 May 2016,"Even after overlooking the spectacularly wooden performance of Keanu Reeves, the first twenty is genuinely quite suspenseful, as you've no idea where the plot is going to go. Unfortunately, it emerges, neither do the filmmakers. What follows is an inexplicably stupid parody of 2005's Hard Candy, rather than an a genuinely scary gore-fest that Eli Roth is known for. We get an hour and a half of painful cackling, cringe-worthy dialogue, false moral dilemmas and a story so beyond laughable that I was genuinely rooting for the protagonist to die, simply so the film would finally end.

Eli Roth seems to be bored of torturing the characters in his films, and has instead turned his sadistic streak onto his audiences, for all the wrong reasons. And trust me, by the end of it, you'll be begging it to stop."
1.0,30 December 2016,"Keanu Reeves is a nice man with a loving family. One night as he's home alone two hot girls show up at his door. You can already see where this is going..? The story is terrible, the directing is garbage and the performances are awful. The only character giving a watchful performance is ""Monkey"", the dog.

I hatewatched this movie to the end, fully frustrated that Reeves character didn't just kill the psychopathic girls. I mean it didn't seem like they had any family or lived anywhere. He could also just called the police and told them the truth.

To summarize: All around terrible movie The director, Eli Roth, shouldn't get any money to make more terrible movies These two young girls should give up on their Hollywood-dream and try the pornbuissness instead."
1.0,8 July 2018,"What started as a moderately promising thriller quickly degenerated into an exercise in endurance - and not in a good way.

From the ""seduction"" onwards, the two female characters rapidly become hateful to the point that it is not fun, thrilling, or entertaining in any way - even twisted ways - to watch. Personally, I only stuck with it because I assumed the girls would eventually get their comeuppance.

But in this sad, morally confused, ugly little film, not only do the perpetrators of mindless destruction and torture get away with their actions without any form of punishment (or even the suggestion that their twisted views have been challenged in any way), but a nice, loving, likable family is destroyed, and the filmmakers seem to think they deserve it.

I honestly struggle to understand what the point of this film is, except to revel in the torture and misery of an innocent man - simply because he's a man.

Even if, as the filmmakers seem to believe, he deserves it because he allowed himself (very unwillingly) to be seduced (by two sirens who refuse to take ""no"" for an answer), that doesn't explain, excuse, or justify why his loving wife and children need to be punished too. What's the message here? What is the audience supposed to take from this film. It's not fun to watch, and it leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste.

I have never thought or said this about a film before - and there have been plenty that I've hated - but this film is disgraceful in every sense. And it's not even particularly well made! Shame on Keanu Reeves for participating!"
4.0,25 December 2015,This was the ... My lord it's so awful .. I can't seem to find the right words to express it It was terrible just nasty wrong sickening and stupid! I'm trying to wrap my head around why someone as amazing as Keanu would star In such a crap film! I mean the only reason I rented the film Was because he was in it I even paid extra to keep it more than one night and now I feel ripped off because it was so terrible I had to turn the movie off halfway through. Why why? Such a perverted film I need holy water sprinkled in my eyes to try to get out the vision of what I've seen out of my head. No wait better yet I need some kind of movie memory eraser type of pill that I can take and hopefully I'll forget I ever rented this depressing awful movie. I wish I'd never rented it I think I may be scarred for all eternity!! Again don't rent it people you'll thank me in the end! :(

1.0,17 May 2018,"The good news first. You will laugh a lot. Because the level of bad is sharknado territory. With the difference that here it is not intended.

I guess theoretically there is a nice idea in here somewhere but the execution is just laughable.

The actors are terrible. Keanu Reeves has shown time and time again that he can only do stoic cool guy but this is some of the worst acting I have seen ever. But if you look at him in some of the most awful scenes you think you see him smile a little because he knows this is just bad. You see Ana de Amas nude, thats the only thing good I can say about her in this movie.

The dialog is ungodly bad. A mixture auf c-movie horroflick and a well...porn.

The direction, i don't know what to say. If this were a film student they would rightfully close the film school he was going to. Since this comes from a studio and has famous actors, it gets a release. Don't watch this."
5.0,25 October 2019,"This could've been a million times better, I don't understand why Eli Roth would make a film with a very disappointing ending!

I mean the first half is so good and Keanu Reeves didn't deserve most of what he goes through; so much cringe I'm trying not to spoil but very much rubs me the wrong way.

1.0,20 July 2021,"A horrendous film that is nothing more than an amalgamation of several other films: Funny Games (2007, the bad one), A Clockwork Orange (awesome film), Hard Candy (an okay film) and Fatal Attraction ( great film).

Eli Roth sucks."
1.0,8 May 2017,"You kind of know what to expect when one of this years DVD releases is on the three for 10 shelf. After reading the back cover, I said to myself ""This is Funny Games, I wonder how similar it is"". It is the same story but so far as the film goes the answer to my own question is ""Not even close"". Out of all the reviews so far, only three or four have mentioned Funny Games. I have just given a nod to Submik for his comment about Michael Haneke. Haneke makes thoughtful films designed to make you consider people that exist on the fringes of society. In Funny Games two young men doorstep a family that has just arrived at their holiday home and charm their way into the house, then, little by little events turn nasty. The build up is slow and the atmosphere is taught.

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the same story being reworked but you do expect some new dimension to be added in the intervening period. I should expect Michael Haneke to be extremely disappointed to have his film mentioned together with this substandard effort.

To give one example, many reviewers have mentioned the fork scene. John Wayne would have said ""It is just a flesh wound"", Robert de Nero would have said ""Just get it out, there are no vital organs down there"" but just when you are expecting Keanu Reaves to man up we find out that he gets tied up instead. Oh dear.

How near could such a story line be to actual events, is it all cheap thrill fantasy? In 1973 two psychotic prisoners (think of the red necks from Deliverance) escaped from a maximum security unit in Maryland, USA. picked up the teenage brother of the gang leader and then went on a killing spree. They killed six members of one family including a pregnant woman who was forced to watch her family being methodically exterminated in front of her, before being gang raped and finally shot in the back. A retelling of these events appeared in the 1997 Graeme Campbell film Murder One. This is the only time I have seen reviews on IMDb from people who have never seen the film. They say they were close enough to the real events for it to leave them mentally scarred and they have no desire to see the retelling on film. So yes, these sort of events actually happen and are a legitimate scenario for a ""Based on real events"" film. What we don't expect is for the story line to deteriorate along the way.

For all those reviewers who gave as their title ""The worst film ever"" or something similar, believe me it is not. If you want to see what 'worse' is involving two girls and a series of men check out Vera Chytilova's film Daisies you will not be disappointed."
1.0,11 September 2022,"This movie starts off like a bad porno and turns into an even worse horror flick. Soon it just becomes annoying at obstinately stupid the protagonists are.

I too am surprised that Keanu of all people signed up for this, this should have been a straight to DVD release.

I am not sure if it was meant to be sending some poignant message because if it was it's lost in a woefully written script that's riddled with plot holes and seemingly incapable people. The result is a couple hours wasted that leaves you just feeling aggravated how dumb everyone is.

The best thing about this movie was the sex scene, that pretty much sums it up."

In my opinion this movie was actually well written and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. If that's not the definition of a good movie then I must be an idiot.

Let's point out the flaws. The acting isn't Academy award winning but it's not horrible. It could be better. It'seems Keanu Reeves so yes you will cringe sometimes. I only did when he screamed. The only thing I didn't really like was the ending. I think the writer of this film was trying to portray a message which I get it. Don't cheat on your spouse cause stuff can hit the fan.

The good things about this movie is it was entertaining, thrilling, and had a few surprise moments.

3.0,29 January 2022,"I actually really like this movie and I had expected not to.

After seeing the reviews I put it off for quite some time but was bored the other day and decided to give it a try. I have to admit Keanu's acting was surprisingly bad in a few spots, and not quite the same as his usual acting. I thought the two girls were great in the roles that they were playing though, and while the movie may have some points of unbelievability, and perhaps is a little far-fetched in some ways, I thought the idea of it was very entertaining and interesting.

I think a lot of the people rating this film are people who are very prudish regarding the type of sex scenes in the movie, are typically Keanu Reeves fans and not really used to this type of movie matter, but you have a lot of films that are absolute rubbish and made just for the sexual content, and a lot of people are giving them good reviews even though the stories are subpar- because they were going in expecting gratuitous sex, and those movies don't even have any storyline whatsoever or a stupid one half the time.

The sex scenes are not even that bad really anyways, it's more the idea of what the sex scenes are representing, it's not like you see any penetration or even a close replica of it, more just flashes of slight movement that give you explicit ideas in your head.

I still don't really get what happened with the one guy in the middle, but that can be forgiven for me because the rest of the movie was entertaining enough for me to not feel the need to try to pick it apart."

OK, so I couldn't resist using the quote since Keanu Reeves is the main character faced with this dilemma. Of course, the ditzy girls are borderline nymphos so the temptation is there for our ""victim"" (term used very loosely). After the obvious happens, the girls played fairly well the batsh!t insane part, move forward in torturing him. And at the point, the movie ends. There is no movement forward or plot beyond that really. I did find some of this amusing but also there is way too much entire stupidity in this film up until the very end leaving anyone wondering ""how?"" It was of course a quality production thanks to Eli Roth directing (not his typical flick, but OK)so points are there but the story itself just wasn't. Nice late night cable flick, not much else."

Idea is there, but the execution is appalling. Keanu taken down by a girl with a fork. Need I say more. Keanu, what possessed you to sign onto this? Unless that was a genuine 3some, then I get it. Stick to John Wick and focus on the sequel to your version of the rampage/revenge gender that is Taken.

Eli, what were you thinking? Where was the disturbing, close your eyes, gore seen last in Hostel. So many missed opportunities. What a let down all round. I actually switched it off 3/4 of the way through, because it was so bad."

1.0,9 June 2016,"Keanu Reeves stars in the remake of 1977 film, Death Game with elements of Funny Games thrown in and maybe having a subtext underneath of the dangers of inviting in foreigners.

Reeves plays Evan a happily married architect whose Spanish born wife and kids have gone to the beach for the weekend while he has to stay behind and deal with work commitments in his beautiful house.

Pretty soon in heavy rain two nubile young women (Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas) knock on his door, their clothes soaked wet and showing off their bodies. It looks like they have ended up lost looking for a party in the neighbourhood, the gracious Reeves invites them in even offers to dry their clothes but the girls start to make their moves on him offering themselves to him how can he resist even though he does try but, it is like being offered free pizza.

Soon the Izzo and de Armas are playing bizarre mind games as they tell him they are underaged and he has committed a crime, they have filmed him having sex with them. This is a sleazy, erotic dark thriller as Reeves becomes desperate. He does not want his wife to find out that he has cheated on her and he does not want to go to jail. The women turn increasingly violent towards him and their behaviour becomes deviant even leading to death.

Director Eli Roth might had been aiming for some kind of lurid black comedy about the dangers of marital infidelity but the material is just too ridiculous and their are not many laughs to be had in alleged underaged sex and misandry."
8.0,21 October 2015,"Awful.

There are no words to describe this ''thing''. I've called it a ''thing'' because you cannot consider it a movie.

After 20 minutes I've stopped the agony. Could not watch it for more than 20 minutes.

Awful lines, awful acting, awful 100%. In 20 minutes I have not seen a decent line or a decent performance. Keanu is awful in this movie. Don't know why to accept acting in this movie. Only reasonable explanation would be that he have not read the script. Or the lines. Ever.

Do not waste your time with Knock Knock (better said ''Knock Out'' for Keanu fans).

Matrix is one of my all times favorite movie. Keanu was one of my favorite actors thanks to Matrix. Now he erased all that. And joined Nicolas Cage on their way to mediocrity. I understand you have to earn money to sustain your way of life, but, do it in a way that you don't embarrass yourself forever.

Awful."

The leading ladies had no back story and their motive for all this stupidity was not clear.

Story had so much plot holes, no character development, stupid threesome and lots of stupid acting.

Even the threesome was so disappointing, i would have watched this movie for that only.

What I actually got was horrible acting from Keanu Reeves, lots of plot holes and a bad script, and two girls who were the only saving grace in the whole movie, thanks to their charisma and energy. To make matters worse, the audience is forced to sit through what I feel was a constant slight against men, based on some of the dialogue and overall feeling throughout the movie. At times, the usage of social media ""culture"" is so obvious and shoved into your face, that you can't help but roll your eyes.

I'm giving this a 4/10 because I enjoyed Lorenza Izzo and Ana De Armas' acting, but I'm sorry to say that everything else was horrible and no one should have to sit through even 30 minutes of this movie. Eli Roth should be embarrassed."

Happily married man with 2 kids is left alone at home for some days. It is raining heavily outside; suddenly there are strangers outside his door and these two attractive young females need some help....

I can say no more than that; but this is an excruciatingly intense adult drama which examines current social issues and says a lot about temptation, seduction, retribution plus more.

At first I thought the performance of the lead actor was a bit under par but his soliloquy mid way between the film was masterful.

The 2 lead young actress give outstandingly fierce performances and I have no hesitation in awarding this movie:

If you like Eli Roth and his way of directing you will like this movie. He brilliantly displays the characters of 2 very dangerous girls and their sick games. The plot is good and the suspense is built up from the beginning. It's very different in the way that it depicts two pretty females as perpetrators, which makes it unique. Keanu plays good, but really all credit should go to the girls, especially to Ana DE Armas. Some parts of the movie were ridiculous, but all in all it delivered. It all really comes down to what you are looking for. If you are looking for a entertaining movie with 2 hot females as perpetrators and their cat and mouse play, you will love it. If you are looking for a Lars Von Trier drama movie, you will not like it."

Take it off Netflix thanks.
3.0,8 July 2016,"When you see Eli Roth as the director of a movie with Keanu Reeves having a leading role, you would expect it to have a certain degree of quality. While this is true in some aspects, the overall experience from Knock Knock is one of disbelief and deceptiveness.

Knock Knock has its own merit. It offers a sort of unique premise and originality in the thriller, drama and even 'horror' themes. This is not your typical or traditional thriller-horror movie where jump scares, blood or gore are present and abound. The premise is simple: A man is home alone and receives an unexpected visit from 2 girls whose intentions seem unclear. Keanu and the rest of the cast do a good job overall with the acting but it does not save a movie that traps itself in a hole where it cannot dig out of.

The movie preys on sexual themes and the 'what-if' hypothetical questions a normal person could be facing with after doing something they are not suppose to. This sets it aside from other movies. But from that point onward, Knock Knock is incapable of climbing any higher and eventually falls off its own constructed steps. After the message of the movie - or lesson if you want to call it that - is delivered, nothing new is added. The worst part is there actually was a lot of potential to be offered with the premise presented. Like stated before, this is not a typical thriller movie. It could have taken a different path, focusing more on originality and 'mind horror'.

The movie is literally unable to advance and offer any new content. Eventually it becomes tiresome and tedious to watch. And this is on a level unlike other horror/thriller movies that, while not being original, still advance the story or plot with new content - whether they be deaths, story elements or just plain gore or action.

With Knock Knock, the movie just plainly stalls and offers no advancements after the theme has set in. There actually is no plot to begin with, although this is not that uncommon in the thriller-horror world. But in Knock Knock we hardly even have a motive or 'raison d'être'. It can even become painful for the viewers to watch when they are left with skeptical and unrealistic actions scene after scene. Does a man let strangers wander around in their house unsupervised, more than once? Can a 40kg skinny woman overpower a man twice her size? If a man made a huge life mistake and someone witnessed it, would he just go about his life normally the next day as if nothing happened?

These and other actions are presented to the viewer on a constant basis and just inject more cynicism into the movie. When you ultimately reach the end, you are glad it was over not due to the plot or story but due to the boredom and unconvincing behaviors.

I was disappointed to the point of writing this review minutes after watching the movie. I felt compelled to warn other viewers. It started so well and promised so much. But we all know the saying: ""The higher you climb, the harder you fall"" - this movie is a perfect example of that. For me, this was probably the movie that took the biggest fall I've seen so far."

1.0,23 February 2017,"I have just finished watching this film and I want to tell: this is amazing! Really, with a rating like 4.9 I was going to see a complete disaster. But what I have found is an absolute masterpiece. Keanu is a fantastic actor, stop perceiving him as Neo. Because in fact he is John Wick. I'm kidding! He is great at playing a person he meant to play. The film itself reminded me a High-Rise (which I think is a pretty good satire). And there was something familiar to an idea of man raped by a woman from Thursday (1998) (which I think is a very decent movie). So if you have liked those two, perhaps, you will like ""Knock knock"". There was a things to laugh at. And there was another things like ""Oh, man, this is so wrong... but this is what happening in our society. Some kind of madness."" Some crazy tolerance mixed with an unnoticeable insidious temptation. What I absolutely loved was a feeling that you can't find a moment when everything went wrong. Like in a real life. You just let things go and some time later you question yourself: how did I let it go so far?"

Second, 7 times out of 10the acting was amazing. Both Bel and Genesis were fantastic throughout the movie. Keanu Reeves, was amazing too, but did have some downsides and incredibly unrealistic dialogue.

Now I can't give it 10 stars, because obviously some pacing, dialogue, and plot hole issues. But overall, a solid 8/10."

This is just a typical annoying horror that makes you wonder why any of the characters would do any of the things they idiotically do.

Keanu Reeves plays the main role, badly. I'm just taking a guess here but i'm quite sure that Keanu was skint that week and decided to jump on this as a last resort.

I would explain further as i usually do give quite an extended review but in all honesty there's nothing to extend on, this is not only low budget but also has the likes of Lorenza Izzo (The Green Inferno) in it who has been in an equal amount of 4 star claptrap as her on screen partner Ana de Armas (Faraday).

This is the type of movie the entire cast of MST3K would walk out on to watch paint dry.

There was no redeeming qualities in this movie. The acting was awful, the plot was mediocre, and the ending was a disappointment. Every actor has their one movie that they make and it's just a total disaster. This is Keanu Reeves' movie.

I ,for one, found this movie funny as HELL. Keanu Reeves makes this movie fun to laugh at. He has some quotes, that are simply brilliant. Most of them involve very foul language, that has been implemented into the movie so badly, that I can't help to laugh at it.

When you finally find out the antagonist's motivation, you're like ""Oh that's kinda cool"" Until two seconds passes, and you realize it doesn't make the slightest sense.

The directing is just plain bland. Not that bad, but not that good either.

Lesser movies might not really tie up all the loose ends, but merely relieve the tension, via payback /revenge... Then there are films that never quite made sense in the first place, and still don't make sense in the last place. The ""why"" is not only never answered, there's never even an attempt or intention to answer it. ""Knock Knock"" is a multi-level mystery: A mystery why Keanu Reeves agreed to be in it, & why anyone would write, produce, direct, or watch it, without , (as I needed to), fast-forwarding more than watching. But what the heck, you already paid your Netflix bill. Right? That's what *I* thought. Don't take an IQ test immediately after watching this film. I'm gonna go take a nap.

No sensible adult is going to allow two airhead young women to get away with what they did. Whoever conceived this story should visit an analyst immediately. The whole thing is ridiculous and unbelievable, and perhaps should have been labelled 'comedy'. But it isn't, so I take it for what I'm told it is. On so many occasions one thought Reeves was finally going to take matters in hand, but he never did, and I thought this character really a damned fool to tolerate all this nonsense. This film is surely an excellent candidate for the Movie Hall of Execution where the Producers, Reeves and the Writer can get what they deserve."

1.0,13 January 2022,"I haven't seen the other movie reviews are referencing but I saw similarities to Funny Games and liked the message, also had similarities to Saw movies in that way but more psychological than other Roth movies, really unsatisfying ending but a message that lingers with you.

EDIT: returned to add, this message is still lingering with me, it's a message/theme of male disempowerment reflected in society and role in the family. Not many movies would attempt this message in this era, this movie did. It may not nail the execution but I'm adding another star now I have had some time and it's still memorable and explains why people wouldn't like it."
2.0,23 May 2016,"The writers were grasping for straws on this one.

Let's face it, as viewers we want to be sucked into the middle of the story; we need to feel the excitement; our emotions have to be pulled from us and our intellect stimulated.

This movie had me almost constantly saying to myself that the situations were unbelievable. Time after time it was obvious the writers would do almost 'anything' to try and create drama, thrills, and/or cause me to become emotionally involved, no matter how absurd the notions behind their ideas were, such that it came off as a comedy; a comedy spoof on how not to write a screenplay.

If you're a highly sexed male that loves to see hot young women naked, you'll see them for a couple 'seconds,' which is probably the movies only redeeming quality, because Ana de Armas (Bell) is definitely a hottie; other than the imagery of Keanu's (Evan) and Ignacia's (Karen) successful family life and home, which was very pleasant, (the setting was nice).

As soon as the antagonists Lorenza Izzo (Genesis) and Ana de Armas (Bell) arrive on screen, which isn't very far into the movie, it goes downhill pretty quickly, except as mentioned immediately above, not that their acting was bad, it's just the writing. The word 'Thriller' should absolutely not be used in the same sentence with any dialog pertaining to this movie, unless to say the supposed thrills were shrouded by unbelievably.

I've loved Keanu since the debut of Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure, but let's face it, he's not the best actor when it comes to delivering believable lines. Unless of course he has very few lines to say. So to say that his lines in this movie were beneath him is a statement indeed. Sorry Keanu!

The only reason we didn't turn it off before it was over was because we paid for the rental, and would feel even more ripped off if we had. At least we could laugh and make fun of the writers. So a comedy it was!

In the end I was left wondering what the moral of the story was. I actually felt for the very first time, that the writers really had no idea, that it was only ever about two crazy hot chicks and nothing more.

Good Luck, if you choose to pay for and watch this movie, as you might just regret it. Then again maybe not, after all, art is in fact a subjective experience!"
1.0,28 November 2020,"I'm a Keanu Reeves fan despite his emotionless appearances in most movies. Perhaps his acting was a little better in this when he starts to freak out but nevertheless, this movie is so freaking pointless. Just plain stupid. The people who gave this movie a high score were probably all of Eli Roth's extended family because this movie is absolute garbage. Hostel was the high point of his career which was just even an okay movie, nothing special, but everything else that he has done has just been awful. I keep going back trying to like a new movie that he comes back with and I never like them. Just retire already Eli Roth."

The girls were so annoying, I wanted to punch them, but I guess that means they played their part well. Keanu was so stiff, his acting was below average. The plot has many holes, if you call 911 and say you want to report your house has been broken into and then hang up, police will come immediately. And also, how on Earth couldn't Evan handle two tiny women - he passes because he was stabbed with a fork, couldn't he just hit Genesis? Wow, such a dumb movie. I can't believe I wasted my time.

1.0,6 March 2016,"As it often happens, behind a mediocre movie, there was an interesting idea that, unfortunately, wasn't developed into a good story.

Knock knock is one of those cases.

The quintessential ""family man"", vaguely goofy, devoted husband and father, gets himself dragged into a dangerous situation involving two alluring strangers who shows up at his door on a stormy night.

Things goes south pretty soon, and the poor, naive, guy finds himself trapped, with charges for paedophilia and murder looming over his head.

Sadly, instead of providing a tense experience, like many other ""home invasion"" movies, Knock Knock flirts with the comedic side of things, trying to be creepy, scary and quirky at the same time, failing miserably to deliver either scares, social commentary or even uncomfortable fun.

The vaguely ethical theme about all men being potential sexual predators just doesn't work, and the whole paedophilia-incest thing sticks up like a sore thumb.

It's heavily implied the two girls were victims of sexual abuse when they were younger, so they're out for revenge, but then again, maybe not and they're just crazy or deranged women... Whatever ambivalence there was, it was made null and void by the absurdity of the situation.

Even accepting the ""good, unsuspecting Samaritan"" premise, no man in his right mind would have bought those girls were 15! And who wouldn't have thrown them out long BEFORE they could have had a chance to work their sexual magic on him? Not to mention the defense would have had a field day with housebreaking, assault and battery, property damage...

Bottom line: the movie isn't scary, isn't thought-provoking, isn't even morbidly gory (like other Roth's works)... It's a poor attempt at mixing up several styles, based on a story that doesn't have a much substance or credibility.

P.S. the least said about acting, the better..."

1.0,25 May 2019,"I've been a big fan of director Eli Roth since his instant CLASSIC Horror debut Cabin Fever (2002) when i saw it at the cinema & it became not just one of my favourite Horror's of all time but also one of my favourite movies of all time & i liked his excellent brutal follow up film Hostel (2005) but after the not very good & too uncomfortable Hostel sequel he disappeared for years!!!

Anyway more films FINALLY arrived after alot of years of Roth producing & appearing in films we ended up with the extremely violent cannibal shocker The Green Inferno (2013) & then Knock knock (2015) & this movie is a well made Suspense Thriller not a Horror movie & this has a good panicked performance by Keanu Reeves.

Basically it's about 2 hot girls turn up on a rainy night to home alone husband & father Keanu Reeves & get inside to call for a cab but the girls have other sinister plans & try to destroy his life that's the basic set up & it's a good suspenseful watch.

There's nothing spectacular about this movie but it is a good old school style Thriller very 90's or felt like that to me anyway!!! So Roth is proving to be a very good director who has moved on from just doing Horror films & is trying different genre's such as in 2018 he released two completely different movies one was the excellent Bruce Willis starring Vigilante Thriller Death Wish & the other a fun family fantasy,A House With A Clock In It's Walls.

Knock,Knock is a solid Thriller"
8.0,8 July 2019,"Billed as a psychological thriller, with a fairly tell-all trailer, this wasn't as scary as I expected and I never the saw the original (Death Game). I had put off watching it for fear of seeing sexual assault (which I don't like to watch as ""entertainment"") but it turned out to be okay from that point of view. The writing was careful that Keanu's character, Evan, was complicit, and consenting to whatever happened to him sexually, albeit under some duress of blackmail (a grey area); but some reviewers hold that he WAS guilty and had some sordid secret but I didn't see that, except the fact he went along with the blackmail because he had cheated on his wife. If roles were reversed, men coming into the home of a woman, it would be an unthinkable film.

So, Evan is a family man whose wife and two children go away for the weekend and two bedraggled young women turn up at his door seeking shelter from the rain, and things go awry when they try to seduce him. Being cynical and judgmental it seems a little tenuous that a man can only hold out for 40 minutes against some pretty obvious flirtation, especially when he does so well at first, and there's an Uber on its way.

You have to suspend your disbelief a lot during this film; it is surprising (and a few reviewers have mentioned) that Evan is a physically imposing man... Keanu Reeves is a big man... but he doesn't seem to be able stay away from two small women. Evan is clearly not John Wick or Johnny Utah! He doesn't fight back as you would expect a man to, but you have to suppose that he is still labouring under the fear that he IS doing something wrong, and shock that this is happening at all, and they are girls and you can't fight girls (in this scenario - it's okay Evan!)

Sadly, the film is poorly made, despite very good acting performances from the three leads. There are lots of sloppy edits, overly long travelling shots and camera/sound crew are visible in reflection in a number of scenes. Also, the film doesn't answer all the questions it poses... as a psychological thriller, there isn't much psychology. The most explanation of things is unspoken (or under breath) communication between Evan and the dog, Monkey... and what happens to Monkey?!

The ending is weird, and not expected. That isn't to say that it's a twist, I was just incredulous, like ""Eh? WHAT!?"" There was no satisfying denouement, I was left quite angry at the end, and I couldn't quite express that without more expressions of shock at how ridiculous it all was.

I didn't enjoy this film, despite good acting. I wondered what the point was. Two girls... and... why!?!? The take home morals of the story are to have weapons hidden ALL over your home... and keep *it* (not the weapons) in your pants. Men beware."

The acting wasn't as bad as you would think considering the reviews, but frankly I just didnt find the characters appealing or beleaivable. It was a relief when it ended although I did feel rewarded. I dont know why, maybe just because i made it through.

I would not recommend this to the average movie watcher, but i will say hats off to Eli Roth he really has a way of provoking emotion. This flick may have crossed the line a bit though, without enough appealing content to really get invested.

I'm a Eli Roth fan and usually his provocative material is enough for me, but i really dont think i liked this one, and im probably not gonna sit through that again..."

I feel like maybe what he's doing here is a favor he owes someone. Because he can't be hurting for $$ after his recent successes.

What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said a hundred times? ...oh, yeah I feel bad for Colleen Camp seems like she's cursed to forever play the friend or neighbor who stumbles upon an affair or something made to look like one in B thriller movies.

1.0,3 July 2019,"This is the IMDB synopsis: A devoted father helps two stranded young women who knock on his door, but his kind gesture turns into a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse.

I'm going to fix it. ""A cheating husband screws two girls who randomly show up on his doorstep, and gets mad when they won't go away.""

It's hard to enjoy this film when it features one of the most tired, most sexist tropes of a man falling victim to seduction of a bad woman.

The girls are written ridiculously overboard, with all kinds of emotional problems and a malevolent streak that is pretty hard to find in non-psychopaths. Reeves quickly becomes the sympathetic character, when actually, everything that happens is his own fault. How hard is it to not cheat? How hard is it to take responsibility?

This is pure nonsense, and although I'm not surprised to see Eli Roth's name attached to this, I am surprised to see Reeves."

Like Ruggero Deodato's LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET, after his cannibal themed films, Knock Knock is a smaller feature, but with a potential to turn up a future classic of cable TV. It's a B movie funny as hell, has a nice build up of sexual tension at the first part and an hilarious ending. Forget if the acting is not great, because the acting wasn't the purpose of the director, neither it was important in the 80's thrillers that KNOCK KNOCK pays tribute to. The important here is the dangerous ride, the good looking girls, Keanu Reeves facial expressions, the music and the jokes. Just drink a beer and enjoy the film."
5.0,11 October 2015,"The new movie from 'Hostel' director is totally boring and disappointing. The movie was as boring as 'Death Game' of which the latter is remake. The cast include experienced Keanu Reeves, even he couldn't provide the support to the movie from stumbling. The film was neither horror nor gore, instead it was a comedy which spoiled the movie. From Director Eli roth who was known for his special horror scenes, it was totally disappointing. It was just like I was waiting for the movie to get finished ASAP. Like other films, Eli was unable to display the horror in this new flick which resulted in negative reviews from critics too.

1.0,21 November 2015,"After the success of John Wick I was interested to see next Keanu Reeves' movie. I believe Knock Knock can now be certified a disappointment, a sentiment shared by many others. It's a juvenile attempt at thriller that goes literally nowhere. This is not a thought-provoking drama, far from it, it's a shallow use of home invasion theme and despite having attractive actors performing clandestine meetings, it looks so bland and boring.

Evan (Keanu Reeves) is a loyal husband, who is also home alone at weekend. Two beautiful ladies come knocking for help, and eventually they seduce him. This is basically the entirety of the movie. It wants to be charming or seductive, yet it ends up insipid. Certainly there's no dangerous game of wit here, even if the two shady ladies are meant to be flirtatiously menacing.

The premise could have worked for a brief period of time, and admittedly the characters look the part, but it rehearsed the same angle until the end of movie. Keanu Reeves looks confusing throughout the movie, he's just baffled like Mark Wahlberg on The Happening. There's no depth on his emotions, and this is a clear miscast. There might be some thrill, a little hope that he would break free in a clever way, although even this aspect is overly streamlined.

Knock Knock is ironically a timid drama, and it overstays its welcome with repetitive plot and silly antics. This is the ridiculous version of Wild Things without the wit and charm."
3.0,17 October 2015,"I was going to write a review detailing how goddamn awful this movie is but post viewing I read some other reviews and decided that they have already said it all. This was a complete waste of time, so I stopped watching halfway through. I only watched it because of Keanu Reeves and although he's not the best actor in the world as demonstrated by his lackluster performance in Man of Tai Chi, he's not the worst either and I've usually enjoyed the movies he's been in... the question is, what did Eli Roth have on Keanu that was that bad he would allow himself be blackmailed into appearing in this movie... this movie is pitiful in almost every respect... if you value your time, give it a miss."
5.0,10 October 2015,"OK so didn't go into this movie with optimism in fact from the trailers I didn't expect much from a bad Funny Games remake or something like that but this movie doesn't deliver on anything. The whole time the only thing that kept me going was the idea of Keanu eventually killing the two girls because they were so irritating, BUT EVEN HIS CHARACTER IS UNLIKE-ABLE.

I don't want to spoil this movie but to sum it up there are many plot wholes, ex machinas and basically things don't make sense, the ending is bad along with a very cliché start. I mean how the hell can the guy constantly fail to subdue the two girls?

Im giving it points for color and cinematography use but thats about it, acting is not awful but the dialogue is more horrifying than the movie. Don't WATCH IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A FETISH FOR THIS KIND OF THING."

I'd never heard of these two girls before, and I'll make damn sure I never see them again.

2.0,21 February 2019,"Maybe I'm undermining myself by even writing a review. But if you're going to see this movie anyway, then at least you can be forewarned.

The tragic thing is...this was almost an amazing movie. A real 10 out of 10 if you like to have your raw nerves played like a mandolin.

This thriller is SO uncomfortable. From its first, cute little family scenes which are sweet without being sickly, the build up after meet the antagonists and then the 2nd act where hell just breaks loose...we are dealing with both bodily threat and being confronted with losing our perfect lives and dealing with our own imperfection of people to be punished as once for our charity and our vulnerability to unlikely temptation.

I so wish things were different and I could recommend this movie the way its style and substance deserve to be.

But then the ending....THAT ENDING!!!!!!!

Bad movies with bad endings are ten a penny. I don't get mad at them. The writer tried their best, I view it, I review it, I critique it and we both move on, no hard feelings.

But the issue here was not that it was too happy, or not happy enough or that it was absurd, over complicated, simplistic or inconsistent. When you invest SO much emotion in a character, a good guy, someone who is pleasant and likeable without being a mary sue and who also shows human flaws like the rest of us getting dragged through figurative hell...you need some type of closure.

Now in this movie you KNOW who the good guys are. You KNOW who the bad guys are the second you see them. And that's fine. It's that kind of movie. Some movies gain a lot from keeping that ambiguous and pulling the rug from under is at the last moment. It can be spectacular .

But this movie is not one of those. This is a battle between an embodiment of good and embodiments of evil. This is its set up. We see it coming for miles. We are able to masochistically sit through this torture porn (and I mean that in a the best possible way for 99% of its run time) to finally see how we're going to finally over come this.

And then the ending comes...

Well, I'm not going to spoil it but ""insulted"" is too mild a term. ""Disappointed"" does not do it justice. I do not like it when people use this word as lightly as they do but it felt trolled by this ending.

If it had just been a bad movie, ironically, I wouldn't have felt so scathed. It could not have been contrived to be more insulting to the viewer. It's like Eli Roth appeared on screen and said ""thank you for taking the time to view my work. Thank you for baring with all the hard to watch stuff on screen and for enjoying it. Now kindly go **** yourself.""

if you ever read this, Eli Roth SCREW YOU. You made such magic with Hostel. You deserve to get hurt for ending this movie the way you did."
2.0,6 March 2023,"Keanu Reeves i like your act but thus film is horrible one with bad end .

And that actress they didn't have sense of humor with all that laugh.

Mr. Keanu Reeves, I admire your acting and your personality in films, but the character you played in this film proved without a doubt that it is not suitable for you as a style of acting with a character different from what you played in most of your films. To the highest level since it is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and I feel sorry that I wasted an hour and a half watching purely cinematic and I feel bad for you because They are at your house and persuade you to do this."
1.0,12 December 2015,"A promising movie that fails to deliver on all counts, but the most glaring problem is the star. A cigar store Indian could act rings around Keanu Reeves. Bill & Ted, River's Edge--yeah--he was great. Because he was playing himself. A weird, stiff, plastic moron. But since then he hasn't been able to find a role for a weird, stiff, plastic moron and yet he's made a career for himself. Hard to understand. The film is 90 minutes and the first half hour was the most excruciating period of time I've spent in a long time. You could honestly pick up a bum on the street, get him to read these lines, and he'd do a better job than Keanu Reeves. The only time he doesn't act stiff is when two young girls in bathrobes are dancing around his living room which is exactly when he SHOULD be acting stuff. If you want a real treat, try to last until the 35 minute mark when he says, ""It's... usually... not... as... exciting... around... here."" I laughed myself sick."
3.0,13 November 2022,"Only watched half of the film. What a laughably ridiculous and utterly stupid film. Bad acting - very wooden, stupid script, stupid scenes, irritating and unrealistic characters, lacking any suspense or depth and a pathetic Keanu Reeves character who talks in a monotone voice and is so weak that he seems to let the 2 young female visitors to his house create mayhem - and is then overpowered by these 2 stupid young girls. How could anyone think this movie was good and worth producing and releasing onto the unsuspecting public. Keanu Reeves needs to rethink what roles he takes or better still retire from any future acting roles."
1.0,22 October 2015,"When I saw the name of Eli Roth as director of this film, I should have taken that as a warning that this was probably going to be a bad movie. Roth's previous work either as director or writer were mostly crazy violent and gory just for the sake of being gory. Unlike his other films though, like the dreadful ""Hostel"" or the awful ""Aftershock"", this one had a known movie star in the lead role -- Keanu Reeves. It was because of Reeves that convinced me that I could give this film a chance.

Successful architect Evan Webber is an ideal husband of an artist wife and a model father of two. One day (ironically it was Father's Day), Evan was left behind at home because of work while the rest of his family went on a beach vacation. That night, two sexy young ladies show up at this door lost and soaking wet from the rain. Evan kindly admits them into his house so they can get dry and call for a cab. However, these two liberated girls had kinky shenanigans in mind for Evan, and then some.

In spite of the fact that the script and the acting were already pretty cheesy from the very start, the premise of the film actually seemed promising at first. Things do get interesting when the girls came into the scene and turned on their charms in an attempt to seduce the faithful family man. After that key scene though, the rest of the film turned south and just got more and more ridiculous up to the very end which unfortunately did not come right away.

Keanu Reeves is one enigmatic star whose career definitely had its ups and downs. In the beginning, he was able to balance his comedy (""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure""), romance (""A Walk in the Clouds""), drama (""My Own Private Idaho"") and action (""Speed"" and ""Matrix""). Since the turn of the millennium though, his career turned for the worse, with no really memorable roles to speak of. His last two films, ""47 Ronin"" and ""John Wick,"" brought his name back up for the better. However, ""Knock, Knock"" knocks him down again with a performance so dismal it will be long-remembered for all the wrong reasons.

Keanu Reeves' wretched portrayal of Evan Webber is simply beyond embarrassing. Reeves playing monster with his family at the start was just the first of many cringe-worthy scenes for him in the whole course of this film. As his character was threatened with death later in the film, Reeves' impassioned appeal for his life was so hilariously delivered with the craziest of words, it actually had me laughing out loud in spite of myself. Finally, when a scene came when we see Reeves' head on the ground with only his comical facial emoting, I totally lost it laughing. I cannot fathom how a star of his stature could have allowed himself to suffer such shameful indignities.

We can't really expect much from the other relatively unknown actors in the cast who also came up with similarly ludicrous performances. Lorenza Izzo (Eli Roth's wife in real life) and Ana de Armas (the hotter blonde vixen) played the two seductresses Genesis and Bel with such loony, over-the-top abandon. Aaron Burns played the gay friend Louis, who was more concerned about the artwork than people. They did look like they were having a lot of fun doing their inane scenes (even though the situations were not supposed to be funny).

What was on Eli Roth's mind when he wrote and directed this? Were all the outrageous scenarios and lousy hammy acting done on purpose to somehow make this film stand out? Was this all an elaborate warning about logging out of Facebook once you are done with it? Anyway, everything was so exaggeratedly bad it was actually uproariously funny. It was definitely not what I expected going in, but I did get a good laugh out of it so I won't call it a total disaster. 3/10."
1.0,5 November 2015,"Knock Knock is a film that truly had, ""Are you f..king kidding me moments?."" On the whole, I was expecting a much bigger picture, as in terms of plot. I saw much wanted to know, why these two sexy honeys were terrorizing our poor. overacting thespian, Keanu, where always towards the end, I wanted to smash the screen. For part we believe, while those girls are theatrically playing their torture game show, for Keanu, a much an unwilling participant, is to do with Evan's (Keanu) predatory acts of past, that he is a pedophile, and this movie starts to become a another Hard Candy, amped up with vengeance, where it looks like they've even borrowed the same house, from that 2006 movie. But that motive was quashed. The reason is simply, they are two hot psycho bi..hes who just want to get off, where in one mind, after seeing this, I thought, well, hey that's different, where the other I was kind of disappointed as in that shot down motive. Regardless, Roth manages to still induce a nasty aura of moments, into the scenes, by camera work, or what's happening, in the story itself, which we know is true Roth. Honestly though, he puts too much into it, with sudden, impulsive touches, where he's trying too hard, but that's how our likable over enthusiastic director is. Don't forget, he gave us that wonderful horror shocker masterpiece, Hostel. Reeve's acting truly has laughable moments, and there's a few, where now I can really see why he sucks as an actor, while also being voted worst actor, in the top ten, but the character is there though. He just doesn't show a range of emotions to it, like he should, or isn't very changeable, when seeing him in a few other flicks, as though he's winging it. A corpulent Colleen Camp, also overacting, appears briefly, playing a friend of the wife's, providing just another laughable ""are you kidding moment?"". Again ref: Hard Candy, neighbor scene. The girls are hot (especially Belle) and funny too sometimes. Take Knock Knock for what it is, certainly something different, but also quite a stupid movie to behold. Sorry Eli."

Inspired? what? this total crap of a movie? inspiration?! don't make me laugh! It's horrible from the beginning to the end. Only thing that made me see it was the girls. Yes, they were gorgeous and they were naked. Nothing else was even fair. The plot is ludicrous. The acting is soooooo bad. Keanu is one of the most terrible actors of all time. He should only be allowed to act on action movies with simple and very few lines to throw. Every time he opens his mouth to speak i cross my fingers...cause the probability of ruining the movie is enormous. There are people commenting on the twist... what twist? there's no twist. And how could there be? there's no plot whatsoever! Ridiculous. He (the Matrix dude!) gets beaten every time by two teens and can't do anything to prevent that!"

Of course it's strictly 18+ and for those who watch a lot of movies. And if you don't see it after the scene where Evan try to delete video, I don't know what to say more, I lmao so hard and woke my neighbors. I can count more scenes like this and can tell with confidence that I saw more small details which prove my opinion if watch it for a 2nd time. But better if you saw it by yourself. There is many of them, some are obvious some may seem not, I was little bit confused at the beginning but cleared that out soon enough, that this movie is mocking under others of its kind. Doing it dirty but just does. Give it a try, but remember that there is a parody to whole genre and looks like a thriller at the same time."
1.0,20 October 2015,"Eli Roth is a master of suspenseful horrors. Unfortunately Knock Knock doesn't follow the likes of Hostel and Cabin Fever. Keanu Reeves is Evan, a devoted husband and father left at home to work whilst his family are away for the weekend. He's an innocent, good natured soul who answers the door to two young women who need help. A seductive game of cat and mouse commences as soon as he lays eyes on them. Things take a turn for the worst when Evan caves in to their sexual advances. Knock Knock's most interesting aspect comes from its very different gender roles. Reeves is the 'damsel in distress', sympathy untoward from his moment of passion. The young women, Genesis (Roth's wife Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) are in control, yet ironically out of control. This Strangers style film struggles to get the reaction it deserves. Serious moments are funny when they shouldn't be. The plus side for director Eli Roth is the women reach the maximum level of annoyance whilst Evan conjures up low amounts of courage, throwing our emotions in to disarray. Knock Knock is a hard one to judge. It'll make you feel dirty and awkward, even if there's nothing to hide."

1.0,28 October 2015,"It's almost impossible to write a review without spoilers, since there is so little content and the mistakes are so obvious it would be a crime to not mention them here. But I'll try.

Keanu Reeves is a loyal family man, who is tricked into cheating with two women. What begins as a one-time mistake, ends up in a lethal cat- and-mouse game as the girls turn out to have a crazy agenda.

There. That's the story. Unfortunately the huge gaps are filled with: mistakes, lazy writing and absolutely terrible (over)acting. The ending is illogical and won't leave you satisfied.

The only ratings over 3 or 4 are from people who enjoyed the few nude scenes."
5.0,19 October 2015,"This movie sucks to the point that I created an account just to write a review for this annoying and disappointing movie. It might have probably been a good movie if Keanu Reeves was able to escape from those two girls and could kill them or at least take them to the police or something. I mean come on, he could have attacked the girl when he was released, they could have had a fight over a gun, since he's a man he could have probably win, but he chose to run away. Also he could have tackled the girls from behind when the dog was distracting them, he already had a knife and a pan. It just annoys me that this movie has potential but it looks like the ending was written by an amateur writer who doesn't know anything about plot twists."
1.0,17 October 2015,"It's a bit disappointed to watch this, I had a high expectation on Knock Knock. I thought it would be a good thriller, because it really have a good new fresh idea on ""home invasion"" series....

No doubt, the idea is good, the trailer is well made, but when comes to the film, I still think there's still space where can improve a lot....I mean...really a lot.

At least, thriller have made viewer feel more intense, heart pumping, but you won't find that quite a lot in here.

I'm a big fan of Eli Roth since cabin fever and hostel, but sad to says that he may not have a big break through compare to the film where he did. He really got the idea, the creativity, but when comes to the outcome of the film,... may be viewer will have more expectations on it.

2.0,14 October 2015,"yes, this movie isn't great but I would hardly say its the worst film ever made. it was watchable however very unrealistic. The film began with some promise but fell apart quickly due to lack of development. The girls are very annoying as it doesn't really make any sense for them to be doing what they are doing especially because they don't even seem like psychos? there is no back story for them at all. it was impossible to form any kind of connection with any of the characters- they were very 2d. I was quite excited for this film because I am a fan of Eli Roths previous work, so I do feel a bit disappointed in its lack of entertainment and substance. I only saw it yesterday and barely remember it. overall its nothing special and I wouldn't call it horror. 4.5/10"

I love horror and thriller movies. I can understand that sometimes there is not much of a story line, but just moments of thrills or horror. But this movies beat the sh*t out of that, because of how bad it is.

And here I mean, they had a story line, which was bad. They had a good actor, which I didn't think could do bad acting, which he did (probably because of the script, but just refuse the roll then). And overall... If I was a sponsor, I would ask my money back. It was just that bad.

1.0,9 October 2016,"Like more than a few men, I saw the trailer with the sexy young women and the hapless husband And thought: ""This one might be bad, but fun."" Well, forget about the fun part. The pivotal sex scene (NOT a spoiler since its central to the ad campaign) is shot in an arty way that robs it of any enjoyment for the viewer. I can only speculate that this was done because the director, Eli Roth, is married to one of the nude actresses (actually, we're not even sure it's really her in the scene due to the gauzy lens/quick cut way it was shot). So without any good sex as a ""reward"" or ""benefit"" we're forced to ask is the punishment in line with this night of illicit pleasure.

The answer is a resounding: Who Cares? Reeves performance is so wooden and weird, I'm surprised he wasn't at least nominated for a Razzie. And all other aspects of the script, from the hokey, wholesome, loving family set up to the preposterous scam the young ladies are running leave the viewer with head- scratching, web-surfing boredom. Again, don't fall for the trap. This movie is now free on Amazon Prime but it is not worth your time.

You're supposed to enjoy a movie. ""Knock Knock"" makes you feel... annoying contempt. It's almost obvious that this was intentionally. If they can't trigger proper emotions to the viewers and they know they can't, at least trigger whatever, just trigger something. That's low.

I thought Keanu Reeves movies are great but I got the feeling he was used - he's forced through a bad script all along. His acting and that of the other actors is nothing to complain about, in fact they are more than believable, carrying the disastrous plot on their shoulders."
2.0,19 June 2016,"Knock Knock: Seducción Fatal is the full title of this little film written for the screen by Eli Roth, Nicolás López, Guillermo Amoedo based on a story by Anthony Overman and Michael Ronald; Eli Roth directs. Five years ago this film would have been one of the many porn hours on late night television – and I suppose that is a comment on how far we have become relaxed in our standards of language (more F bombs is this 'story' than any film in recent history) and in your face sexuality on the screen. There is most assuredly an audience for this (Keanu Reeves fans who will watch anything he is in, people hungry for young naked women with fine bodies, midnight home intruder tales, etc), so why did it flop when released? A question worth investigating..The preponderance of Latino actors and crew may be due to the fact that it was filmed in Chile.

The 'story': 'When a devoted husband and father Evan (Keanu Reeves) is left home alone for the weekend (his artist wife Karen (Ignacia Allamand) and two children head for the beach on Father's Day!), two stranded young women Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) unexpectedly knock on his door for help. What starts out as a kind gesture results in a dangerous seduction and a deadly game of cat and mouse. Evan falls into temptation and the seductresses wreak havoc upon his life, turning a married man's dark fantasy into his worst nightmare.'

If you really want to know the details of what happens, watch the film – or not. It is an assault on the ears and eyes – but is fairly in keeping with today's relaxed sexual mores. Grady Harp, June 16"

No one could ever accuse Keanu Reeves of being a good actor, however, in Knock Knock, he reaches new heights in being terrible, as do his co-stars, script writers, director and pretty much every person involved in this film.

I wish I'd read the reviews before wasting my time watching Knock Knock.

Please, please do not watch it, you'll never get that time back.

2.0,5 April 2016,"Eli Roth directs and co-writes the screenplay with Nicolás López and Guillermo Amoedo. It stars Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Music is by Manuel Riveiro and cinematography by Antonio Quercia.

Reeves plays Evan, a devoted husband and father of two, who while he is left home alone, is visited by two young women soaked and apparently lost. Letting them in to his home as an act of kindness, things quickly spiral out of control.

You do wonder if Eli Roth sits at home looking at the reaction to his movie and giggles like a schoolboy. It's invariably a distinctly average film, but it does get a reaction from the audience, something which Roth is gleefully aware of. Pic is actually a remake of Peter S. Traynor's 1977 movie, Death Game, which starred Sondra Locke and Colleeen Camp, both of whom lend their names to production for this release.

At times it feels like we are part of one of Roth's wet dreams, or conversely one of his sick jokes. Yet as the cast struggle to instill acting gravitas (the girls actually become more annoying than frightening), and Roth chooses psychological themes over blood and guts, there's a deft whiff of a moral fable hanging in the air. While also of note is the nods to film noir, both in story and visuals. It isn't enough to save the piece, but it's interesting enough as an aside to the chaos inside the house. 5/10"

We love movies; good acting; we go to a place where we can have a good time, we can indulge ourselves with what I call ""movie theater food"", which is not even fast food. The company, we try to stay away from reality, it is good for us to ""travel to places and meet with people"", and most of us have the dream of maybe someday write a script or even a book that can become something good. However, if you do that, I totally doubt someone related to the movie industry will ever read your stuff if it is not delivered from somebody with influence in the industry. OK, my point is many of us saw Keanu Reeves -- trailer, magazine, news or even the sign as you were heading to buy your ticket and we gave it a chance. Totally waste of time and money! Any big fan of movies is capable of writing something better than this movie. I can make a better story on the screen in 2 or 3 hours. I am very disappointed with the producers. Maybe something went wrong and they had to finish it anyway.

1.0,25 October 2015,"Review: I really didn't enjoy this film! Keanu Reeves acting was awful and his constant whining got on my nerves. The girls were also nuts and they seemed to go a bit overboard at times, (understatement). Anyway, Reeves plays Evan Webber, whose a happy family man with 2 kids, a beautiful wife and a impressive house. While his wife takes there kids for a short break, Evan decides to stay at home because he has to catch up with his work. Whilst designing on his computer at home alone, 2 girls turn up on his doorstep, in the pouring rain and they ask him if they can use his Internet to find the address for a party in the area. The somewhat puzzled Evan, invites them in and he makes them feel comfortable by giving them dry clothes while he dries there wet ones. From there I would have thought something suspect was happening! Anyway, after loads of flirting from the girls, they finally get down to business (wink wink) and when he wakes up in the morning he realises that the girls have taken over his house. Like most men, he regrets the sexual acts that he performed with the girls the night before, so he quickly drops them home and he cleans up the mess that they let behind. The crazy girls then go back to his house and completely destroy everything whilst tying him up. They tell him that they were underage so he's unable to call the police and they threaten to tell his wife about what he's done. Now, if these girls have done this type of thing before, how the hell have they got away with it? I must admit, Reeves should have used his head by physically putting them in the cab but he was thinking with the wrong head. The thing that made me cringe the most, had to be his acting. Right from the beginning when he was playing a family man, it just didn't seem natural and his weird outbursts made it even worse. Also, when he was given the chance to hide, why didn't he pick up the phone and call the cops outside? Anyway, I won't carry on slating the script because it's holier than a vicar. The two girls played there part well and I really didn't know what they were going to do next but the overall movie was pretty bad. Disappointing!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Eli Roth who teamed up with Quentin Tarantino to make Inglorious Basterds, Cabin Fever, Hostel I & II, Grindhouse and the Green Inferno. He's also had a successful acting career in movies like Jurassic Park: The Lost World, Hostel, Southland Tales, Death Proof, Rock of Ages and the disappointing Man with the Iron Fists so he had enough experience to correct the awful script in this movie. It's not very often that a Keanu Reeves movie makes such a low amount of money at the box office but after watching it, I can completely understand why. He should just stick to action movies because he made a right mess of Bram Stokers: Dracula, with that weird accent and annoying puzzled look on his face throughout the movie. 

Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $2.5million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mystery/thrillers starring Keanu Reeves, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. 2/10"
1.0,15 February 2016,"This film draws you in. It does a great job of building anticipation and you really start to feel for Keanu's character. He is a very likable guy and the antagonists are genuinely disturbing early on. Everything is set up so well for a classic B horror movie. Unfortunately, I wouldn't hold it to even that standard. Everything goes to crap after the first act. As another reviewer stated, Keanu's performance after the introduction is pretty reminiscent of Nicolas Cage in 'Wicker Man'. He's not entirely terrible, but the script doomed him from the start. The weird factor of the villains essentially went from good to just plain stupid. Lots of awful, awful clichés also pop their heads out in this film. There's nothing subtle about them either. Lots of events and stupid decisions are very lazily thrown in so that the writer could force certain things to happen. Even the way these things happen is ridiculous. One scene in particular made me cringe and almost turn it off halfway through. Terrible, terrible writing, even for a horror movie. I shouldn't have to say it like that, though. Just because it's horror, doesn't mean you don't have to put some original thought into your work. If you enjoyed the theme of the film, but want something a little better, check out 'Hard Candy' with Ellen Page. Still a bit weird, but certainly superior to 'Knock Knock'."
5.0,26 September 2016,"I am not a fan of IMDb reviews nor Eli Roth. However, I am compelled to write a review, because this is one Keanu Reeves' best performances. Yes, people are being overly vicious on here. The film is bad, but not the worst (and especially not Roth's worst). I won't say one needs to give the film a chance, but I will ask viewers to refrain from using Reeves' performance as one of the film's problems. Ever since The Devil's Advocate, Keanu has been one of the few actors who responds naturally and realistically to extremely trying situations (e.g., The Matrix, The Lake House, John Wick). Relax and watch objectively. Always."

Evan lets them come in and what started out as innocent encounter turns into a bizarre time for Evan. He is seduced by the girls who end up torturing him and trashing the house and desecrating his wife's art work sculptures.

I like Keanu Reeves and his movies. I took this out thinking this would be another gem. Wrong. Am only doing this review to let people know what they are getting into. Once the real motives of the girls are revealed I hit the FF button often. I did not like seeing what was presented on the screen. I stayed with it FF button and all as I wanted to know how this ended, how Evan would triumph and the girls defeated.

This is really hard to watch even with the FF button doing its job. The ending shows no resolution and when the family comes back from the beach, the little boy exclaims as the wife opens the door, ""Daddy had a party."" Fade to black.

Now it seems I need to read a review of Keanu Reeves' movies to see what I am getting into. This was highly disappointing. (1/10)

2.0,3 November 2015,"Eli Roth, he can confuse me big times sometimes. Then he delivers ultra gore, The Green Inferno (2015), and on the other hand he delivers...Knock Knock. I didn't watch any trailers so I didn't know what to expect. Also it was well promoted and even now stills are popping up on our telee on daily base.

The fact that Keanu Reeves was in the lead did me finally pick this up after seen John Wick (2014) which I found great in his performance and story. You can see it coming, I should never had opened that door to go see Knock Knock. It's over 90 minutes of the same again and again. It do build up rather good but once the girls enter the house it's downhill. Using explicit words doesn't make a movie. Even as not that much was explained it's easy to understand that the two girls are doing it for fun. Did ring a bell, A Clockwork Orange (1971) also did a home invasion like so many other flicks like The Strangers (2008) which did gave me the goosebumps. This here wasn't intend to give you the creeps but for an Eli Roth flick I found it rather a weak flick. You can see it coming from miles that the threesome is on the way and it does, maybe for many that will be the moment of the flick itself because it's juggtime.

Could have so many potential but I found it too much of the same again and again.

4.0,5 November 2015,"The first time I read the plot, I think it's gonna be a good movie. Not great. Good. The plot is good, and Keanu Reeves is there.

In the whole movie, I am thinking, ""Why someone like Keanu Reeves plays in a movie like this?"".

Maybe he's not the one to blame. But if you watched the whole movie, I think you would agree if I say, they should put 'Comedy' in the genre instead of Horror.

Keanu doesn't do anything bad. It's just I'm disappointed on his decision to play in this kind of movie. He's such a great actor. John Wick movie isn't great, but he brings the movie to the next level. But with Knock Knock, the storyline is just can't be helped."
1.0,5 February 2016,"""Knock Knock"" is a Thriller movie in which we watch a man staying alone in his house for a weekend because his family went to spend the weekend to the beach. At this time two strange and beautiful young women knock on his door for help.

When I watched the trailer of this movie my expectations were not so high but I wanted to watch something more interesting than this. The interpretation of Keanu Reeves who played as Evan in this movie was not the best and I believe he did not reach his true potential. That happened of course not only because of the plot of the movie but also because of the cast of it. The direction of the movie which made by Eli Roth was not something extraordinary because there is not something more to show.

Finally I have to admit that I expected something better from this movie and of course from Keanu Reeves. ""Knock Knock"" is not so bad if you low your expectations before watch it and not after, you just have to be better prepared when you will or if you go to watch it."
2.0,15 November 2015,"I do not understand how Keanu could even associate his name with such 'an insult to our intelligence' enterprise, not to mention the fact he is 'starring' in it. Let aside Raspberry Awards, a special price 'Dumb and Dumber' should have been especially invented for this exploit (my hand will fall off if I write 'movie'). I gave it a 3, as I was laughing with tears while the fading shadow of Matrix was fighting with all his stamina to avoid being raped... This is a lesson for all men wanting to either preserve their chastity, or remaining faithful to their loved ones - to walk on the opposite side when encountering sexy girls heading in groups larger than 1 (one)! Or, for Keanu's credit, the actual rape scenes were the 20th take, assuming the Director was not pleased with previous takes; the poor lad was exhausted by shooting the same scenes over and over, so he finally gave up and succumbed to Eros... I could better live with a retinal image of a tired actor giving in to pleasure, than being overcome by two horny teens. All in all, I suggest to poor Keanu to undertake face modification surgery, if he wants to avoid his (remaining) fans (of any gender!) chasing him relentlessly upon eye contact...or obtain a restraining order against humanity for a min. 50 cm, a safe distance for any sex tool or organ! The 2 girls - they did their job properly, so now - after this... 'film', they can find their glory in less promiscuity indulging strip-joints or massage parlors. Finally, the screenwriter must be paying a hefty bill to his shrink, as such sex obsessions take long to heal - let us all encourage him to write a sequel, in which - after Keanu would take fence painting lessons as in Karate Kid 101, he indomitably holds the line against evil, men fluids thirsty nymphos - until police arrives and saves his (mental) virginity! Shame on you, Mr. Von Trier! This is how you do an art movie, not your recent years tribulations. Shame on us the petty viewers, for not being able to comprehend such a capo d'opera!"
5.0,4 April 2023,"I feel like my rating might be too nice but I'm leaving it as I rate films as soon as the credits roll.

What this film did well; the horror. I'm a huge fan of horror films and this film masterfully made me feel dread and an overwhelming sense of discomfort, that a lot of modern ""horror"" Just doesn't (maybe I've been desensitised over the years by reruns of Saw and Hellraiser). I was very uncomfortable and stressed throughout this film and that was definitely intentional.

However... this film doesn't achieve anything beyond that. From stupid decisions from Evan (Keanu Reeves), the nonsensical decisions by... literally everyone else who isn't a villain (friend character and the physiotherapist basically) and the poor handling of the films subject matter pull this film right down into the gutter as one of the poorest films I have ever seen."
5.0,14 November 2015,"Another flick that sets in an isolated place with the limited cast. A low budget film, which was a remake of the 'Death Game'. After playing a strong character in his previous film, Keanu Reeves is back exactly opposite to that one. Yep, remember what happened to the two men who break-in into his house in 'John Wick', but here it is like what if he's not able to handle them or to do anything about it kind of Circumstance.

He played a normal family guy, a father of two children with a beautiful wife and a big house. The trailer itself revealed half of what the movie's. But the rest of the film is not bad at all, and that does not count as I'm praising it. The movie was average because of the writing was too loose. Not only predictable, but aimlessly moved and the motives were never explained. So the mystery remains mystery.

It was one of those films that leaves behind us to suspect the possibilities. A broad open for a sequel, but likely there's very less chance for another film. The girls were so good looking and performed well. The theme aimed for erotic-crime-thriller, but did it achieved? I don't know, the original was released in the 70s, which might have been too sexy for that time, but in the present world, it is not that special or effective, just like 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You could watch it to enjoy your moment, but it would be a cinematically impressive with the great writings, actings, with twists and turns and all.

It is so sick, I cannot imagine why anyone would waste an hour an a half of their life watching this twisted, heartless sick movie. And I also have no idea why Keanu Reeves would agree to such a stupid role - it has absolutely no relationship to his strengths as an actor, and he looks appalling throughout the movie. I cannot stand the behavior that is exhibited in this movie - it is so cruel. Is this what the world now thinks is entertainment? And people actually put money into making this puke? This is a HORRIBLE HORROR movie that doesn't teach you anything, and it is masochistic to watch it. If you want to hurt your soul, this is the movie for you.

Honestly, don't waste your time with this one. I'm a Keanu fan, but the movie is lacking any intensity. The characters lack depth, are superficial, annoying and irritating. The film is full of very cheap plot devices, there are no twists (at least for me), and it didn't really make me care for any of the characters.

Sure there are some good scenes and moments, but overall it was unable to hold my attention or make me feel anything at all. No compassion for any of the characters.

I really really felt like fast forwarding parts of it. Such a bore!"
1.0,5 March 2017,"This movie gets a lot of hate for no obvious reason.

I think that this is a perfect B-movie. It has simple, yet entertaining plot, not-so-bad actors, and most importantly - unconventional main idea. It's rather fun movie, yet sometimes I was genuinely terrified. This never happens when I watch low-budget jump-scare horrors.

You shouldn't expect much from this movie, but if you want to see some quality B-grade stuff, this picture is certainly worth your time."
2.0,30 October 2015,"Eli Roth specializes in weird and twisted films, and this one is no exception. It is hard to understand what Roth was trying to accomplish with it, though. Is it a commentary on ultra-feminism, or a morality tale about how men can never say no to you-know-what?

It reminds me of the film Hard Candy, which I didn't much care for either, but at least that one made more sense in terms of the characters. In that film the man was a paedophile, and the girl was kind-of nuts, but slightly more justified in her actions.

In this story, the guy (Keanu Reeves), is a perfectly good man, happily married, and a loving father. Yet the crazy bitches (I'm allowed to say that, it was in the movie) who invade his home, and seduce him, are the real predators.

There's moments of black humour throughout it that really worked. The last line made me laugh out loud.

I think that a lot of people will hate this movie. Indeed it is very frustrating to watch, as Keanu gets tortured by these psychos. But I believe that is what Eli Roth was going for, so I have to give him props for that.

As I said earlier, the film gives a lot of mixed messages. There's lines of dialogue that seem to relate to the concept that all men are sexual deviants, but I do not believe that this is the actual point of the movie. (Roth's wife is nearly 20 years his junior, after all, so he's in no position to talk about paedophilia).

I'm more inclined to think that this is a reaction to many of the so-called feminists and man haters out there.

Or maybe it's just meant to be trashy entertainment.

Who knows."
1.0,1 February 2016,"I honestly expected a lot more from this movie. I normally do like movies with Keanu Reeves but this one is for sure not one of his better ones. He acts okay and tries to save the movie but it was just not enough. The other two main actresses Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas drag the movie down. I thought they were annoying, and not only because of their characters. The story itself is quite boring and leaves you with unanswered questions and that I do not like. It's also categorized as a horror movie and I absolutely don't get why. You could maybe call it a thriller, even though you won't be thrilling a lot, but certainly not a horror movie. Knock Knock is just a disappointing movie if you ask me."

1.0,17 October 2015,"Unline some other reviewers here, I realize I am not qualified to judge acting. Like most movie watchers I am not an actor, not a film or theater director and not an educated acting expert. I am just a film lover, therefore - like most people writing reviews on IMDb - I am not exactly qualified to judge Keanu Reeve's acting. And that's great, because I have no problems with his acting. If I know anything about acting, I can say that Keanu Reeve's is not a great drama actor and has never been, he's just not that kind of actor. And that's probably why he never does that kind of movies. Neither does Arnold Schwarzeneger, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt. However, he is a successful actor because he is great for a different type of movies, for portraying people of certain type - real life people of certain type. Therefore he is a legitimately good actor. It's hard for me to describe that, but if you have watched other movies that Keanu was in, you know what I mean. What I am trying to say here is, his acting is not any worse in this movie than in others, like The Matrix, Street Kings and John Wick. What makes this movie terrible, though, is directing. And that's Eli Roth's fault. This movie is just pointless. It's for the kind of people who like movies that are disturbing just for the sake of being disturbing. And it probably is good in that genre. But with Keanu Reeves being in it, I guess people expected it to be a different kind of movie."
1.0,3 December 2015,"Hi guys. This is a pretty objective review - so read on if you wonder about the title. I want to mention that I have never left a review on IMDb, however, after watching this movie I felt compelled to warn everyone of the harms which watching this movie may cause.

Once a week we have a 'surprise movie night' at my local cinema called 'Sneak' which I went to with my date (bad mistake). The first couple scenes still seemed like a typical Hollywood thriller or just another boring old love story. However, the moment these two ladies knocked on the door, it was clear to me that Keanu, whose acting was horrific, would cheat on his beloved wife and family and destroy his idyllic life. Alright story up to here...

Now lets skip the aforementioned disaster acting, storyline and cringe-worthy conversations. There is a couple moments where I was actually wondering how this movie received a 'go' to be played in German cinemas. In my opinion it highly promotes paedophilia. (I don't mean to offend anyone by saying this)

.Spoilers. I want to explain this statement: two hot girls, looking like they are in their mid-twenties, seduce this 43 year old father and then pretend they are minors and want a huge punishment for this Keanu-dad's behavior... that already is sick. But the scene where Bel puts on his daughters school clothes and calls him daddy???? Let's not forget that she is wearing an 8 year old's (his daughters) undies. What the serious f... - what in the world - this is sick! Then she 'rapes' him (he easily could have slammed her off the bed) and continues to call him daddy. I mean what in the world is wrong with these people??? Who came up with this idea? To me this person belongs in prison. I am being serious. Turns out these girls aren't even minors and the whole movie made no point.

To me this was the absolute worst movie I have EVER seen. My date felt the same. We both felt pretty awkward after watching this movie! No actually throughout this WHOLE movie.

Also - what was the role of this dog, which to me was the only likable thing in this movie.

Last note, I kinda hope whoever wrote the screenplay or came up with the idea will be punished. In whatever way. Child molesters are probably enjoying this movie.

Let's just quickly forget we watched this and move on with our lives."
3.0,1 April 2016,
1.0,10 October 2015,"So the main reason why I wanted to check this movie out was because it has Keanu Reeves in it. One of the most liked bad actor in the business. Despite the premise not being all that original, I wanted to see how Keanu would play the role of the guy getting tormented. Watching this movie was like watching ""The Human Centipede (First Sequence)"". Except instead of the 2 girl that knock on the door of a stranger getting tortured, it's the other way around where the roles are reversed. And reminded me of the movie ""Hard Candy"" except nowhere near as engraving. This is another exploitation by Eli Roth, that is more about the amusement factor over intense suspense factor. For a Eli Roth movie, surprisingly it's not as brutal or gruesome as I thought it would be. As a matter of fact there really isn't much blood in this movie. Sure, there is elements of human nature that did get slightly interesting, but it contradicts itself quite a bit. This movie is mostly a amusing silly parody. Especially Keanu Reeves who actually looked like he was trying to parody himself in a movie he is in. This is a pretty bad movie, not awful but a ridiculously bad movie. And I think that was the intention of Eli Roth, to make a bad movie that could become a cult flick. I give this movie a 5/10.

1.0,31 July 2019,"I'm a big Keanu Reeves fan and also a fan of a broad range of thriller/psychological movies. I try to give credit where good ideas lay. But this. I WANTED to like this - on some level, any level.

Keanu's character is very on the surface. They spoon feed the audience every emotion he has and then hits you on the head again with it a few extra times for good measure. The girls' characters are the opposite. You think that there is a tantalizingly back and forth dynamic trying to figure out who they really are - what they really want - but in the end they make absolutely no sense. No answers. Nothing. It's frustrating on both ends of the spectrum.

Nobody reacts the way you'd think that they would. Nobody behaves in realistic ways. It's just a disaster. They try to make it sexy but it flounders. I can't find any good points at all in it and that makes me very sad.

5.0,4 August 2016,"I created a new account because I lost my old one, but after watching this, I have a lot of mix feelings that got me do this review after a long while. I'm not an Eli Roth fan or a Keanu hater (enjoyed him in Constantine and the movie in general) so my opinion is a bit unbiased compared to the reviews here.

Ill start with some of the good points. The first I noticed is that the film has a nice vibe to it. The colors they used were really pretty. The location and set, all in all was aesthetically pleasing.

This is an effective trick sometimes with thriller/horror genre because it can balance the tension without too much negative energy. kind of like ""zombies in a nice super-mall"" movie setting, if you know what I mean. This is one of the main reasons why I kept watching hoping that something good will come out of it. But alas...

The bad. The most important part that could save the movie because the concept could actually work with some solid acting. The acting is ATROCIOUS, I found myself shaking my head from the dialogue alone. All the people saying it was done on purpose do not know what good directing is. The whole thing seems like a miscommunication from what the director had in mind or someone was not listening.

The script\casting. Bad acting can only *sometimes* work with a solid script. This is what successful comedies are like. Even unintentional ones. Now if this film is a ""subliminal comedy"" Then why is the script more of a ""dafuq..."" instead of ""LOL""? Many, many cringe worthy lines were said up until the end.

I felt bad for Keanu honestly, it's like the movie is trying to showcase his ""acting capabilities"" and it did in a shi*** way. I was thinking though, who would be not the better actor for the role but an actor that fits the role. I came up with Sharlto Copley, that guy can be pretty funny with that accent. He just fits the role. The two girls were just plain retards They could at least make their characters extremely evil like portrayed but also a bit likable in a sense. that would have worked LOT better.

I hate long reviews but I felt ranting a bit because of all the pseudo intellectual ""film expert hippies"" that claim it more than it is because they are smarter than us. It really just felt like a cluster fudge of miscommunication issues. If you want decent film similar to this go watch Hard Candy first."

They both get plenty of movies that are 3 or 4 out of 10 stars. I didn't think Keanu Reeves could act this poorly (stick to playing Neo and John Wick). He was probably wondering why he was making this movie himself, when he was acting... you'll see what I mean when you watch this. The two girls made absolutely brilliant psychos. They played their roles well, but it was just way, way, way too much. I have to wonder if this situation actually happened to someone and then wrote a screen play. Either that, or they have a very whacked mind."
1.0,5 February 2024,"I recently subjected myself to the so-called ""thriller"" Knock Knock, and I can confidently say it was a colossal waste of time and a cinematic disaster. This film, directed by Eli Roth, left me questioning not only my choice of movies but also the state of the horror genre as a whole.

To begin with, the plot is as flimsy as a house of cards in a hurricane. The storyline revolves around a seemingly normal family man played by Keanu Reeves, who opens his door to two attractive and manipulative young women during a rainstorm. What follows is an agonizingly painful attempt at creating suspense and tension that falls flat on its face. The entire premise feels contrived, leaving viewers with a sense of incredulity rather than fear.

The performances in Knock Knock are cringe-worthy at best. Keanu Reeves, typically a reliable actor, appears lost and out of his element. The dialogue is stilted and forced, making it difficult to empathize with any of the characters. The two female leads, played by Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo, deliver performances that are more annoying than unsettling. Their characters lack depth and substance, relying on tired stereotypes to elicit any reaction from the audience.

As if the weak plot and lacklustre performances weren't enough, the film's attempts at social commentary come across as pretentious and heavy-handed. Knock Knock tries to explore themes of infidelity and morality but ends up beating the audience over the head with its messages, leaving no room for subtlety or nuance.

The cinematography and direction do little to salvage the sinking ship that is Knock Knock. The overuse of shaky camera work and uninspired visual choices only add to the overall sense of disappointment. The film fails to build any genuine suspense, resorting to cheap jump scares that are more likely to induce eye-rolls than genuine fright.

In conclusion, Knock Knock is a cinematic misfire that should be avoided at all costs. It's a prime example of how a promising premise can be squandered by poor execution. Save yourself the agony and choose a movie that respects your intelligence and delivers a more satisfying viewing experience."

3.0,2 February 2024,"The movie does not explore themes of temptation, infidelity, and consequences because the plot possesses no genuine psychological foundation. In other words, the two young women in the movie are portrayed more as extreme manmade caricatures rather than fully developed characters with authentic and sustained motivations.

Even without knowing 'Death Game 1977,' the film from which it departs, the plot is, to some extent, predictable. Yet, it grows too quickly into implausible scenarios. That said, it is true that Ana de Armas is gorgeous, and Keanu Reeves is somehow funny. However, the aftertaste is quite unpleasant.

Eli Roth misses the opportunity to give us something to contemplate and also the chance to incorporate a well-crafted musical score."

The girls acted their parts so well that they made me angry which was the point. Keenu Reeves was wonderful as always, this was a very different role from his usual and he hit it on point. The plot of the movie was excellent, the acting was phenomenal, the moral of the story was brilliant. I just don't understand why so many people hated this movie. Maybe it was too racy? I'm not really sure but if you are a fan of Eli Roth's work, you will absolutely love this movie. Do not let the other reviews fool you."

In reality, at no time would he be in that situation in the first place or anything that followed. Thrillers (or any movie) should not create unrealistic moments just to relish in an outcome. This movie is full of terrible moments that are only put in place so we see the outcome. I LOVE Keanu though. I hope he used the money from this film for a good cause.

Positives for Knock Knock (2015): Keanu Reeves gives a good performance in this movie and that's about it for the positives.

Negatives for Knock Knock (2015): The characters of Bel and Genesis, played by Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo, are among some of the most aggravatingly annoying characters that I've seen in any movie. First of all, they try to convince the auidence that they're both underaged except no one believes that because they do not look like teenagers especially given that Ana de Armas was 27 and Lorenza Izzo was 25 when this movie came out. Also, these characters apparently ruin the lives of married men for no reason and I'm like you people need therapy immediately. And finally, the fact that these two women take down Keanu Reeves is unbearably stupid especially given that the first John Wick came out almost a year ago and I'm sorry no one is going to believe that crap.

Overall, while it's not as awful as The Green Inferno (2013), Knock Knock (2015) is by far the most annoying movie that Eli Roth has ever made."
8.0,1 June 2019,
3.0,7 November 2020,Need I say more? Don't waste your time... I had to fast forward through the majority of the film... Too unbearable to watch Keanu play the role of a helpless man. Yeah. Right. Not entertaining. Not even worth examining or contemplating.
5.0,7 April 2024,"My guess is that 95-98% of all heterosexual men, happily married or not, will do the exact same thing as Keanu Reeves' character in ""Knock Knock"". Heck, I even think it took a long time before he gave in. I would, if I'm honest, be a defenseless prey as well. You just don't say no when two girls with the looks of Ana de Armas and Lorena Izzo are standing naked in your bathroom, soaped up and promising it'll remain ""our little secret"".

So then, what is the point ""Knock Knock"" is trying to make? That all men are easy and weak preys? Okay, point taken. Or perhaps the point is that you can't keep unfaithfulness secret? Or maybe there isn't a point to make, and Eli Roth simply wanted to show how hot and sexy his wife Lorena Izzo is.

""Knock Knock"" is a remake of the obscure but original & entertaining ""Death Game"" from 1977, starring Colleen Camp and Seymour Cassel. Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) is home alone on Father's Day, as his artist wife and two kids are spending the weekend at the beach. Evan obviously loves his family because the house is full of adorable photos of the four of them. Seriously, I have never seen so many family photos in one house. It's almost sickening. Evan also really tries hard to resist when two stranded (and insanely beautiful) girls show up at his doorstep and literally throw themselves at his feet, but his resistance eventually breaks, and Evan experiences a hot threesome in his bath -and bedroom! Was it all worth it? Of course not! The next morning, Bell and Genesis refuse to leave, turn into stalkers, and their behavior gets more psychotic with each hour that passes, until they even set up a fake trial against poor tied up Evan.

If it was Eli Roth's intention to make a nail-bitingly tense and disturbing home-invasion thriller, I'm sorry to say that he failed. ""Knock Knock"" never becomes suspenseful, probably due to the mediocre acting performances and the implausible plot. Especially compared to similarly themed films (like ""Funny Games"" or ""The Strangers""), it's a rather weak and forgettable effort with only two highlights: sex in the shower - duh! - and Pixies on the soundtrack."
1.0,29 September 2018,"I saw the whole hole scene as a meme, and I thought, a scene that had a movie that was made into a meme? Can't be that bad, and if it is at least I'll have a giggle.

But this was saddening. The whole plot made me confused, as well did the constant personality changes in all these characters.

I also felt like throwing up a couple of times.

There is no understandable motivation for this senseless attack of a successful family man. Needless violence and uncalled for mischief is the only plot line. It might as well be a vignette in The Purge. There is no backstory or satisfying ending."

2.0,20 October 2018,"This is a remake of the scummy sleazy 70s psycho-sexual B movie ""Death Game,"" where Sondra Locke and Colleen Camp portray nutso lesbians who put a smug Seymour Cassell through Hell. For a while, this version ""Knock, Knock"" is O-k as Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas) - soaking wet skanks in hot pants and heels - show up at the front door, claiming to have gotten lost on their way to a party. They worm their way inside. Architect Evan Webber (Keanu Reeves) playfully tries to resist their slimy slutty seducing give-and-take. Evan has to work, thats why he stayed behind in an empty house while wifey and kids go ahead to the beachhouse. Curious inquiries turn into flattery, flattery turns into light physical contact, light physical contact turns into rubbing up and erstwhile embraces. Throughout, Evan tries to politely navigate the situation, bobbing from chair to chair, trying to avoid these girls' clear advances. But he doesn't exactly kick them out, either. Here's a narcissistic guy approaching middle age, with a family, his days as a hard-partying DJ long behind him; surely he can't resist all this willing female flesh, can he? Eli Roth, who actually has a talent for comedy, expertly choreographs this game of sexually loaded musical chairs, all the while keeping us guessing as to Evan's true desires - even as the man seems to be playing everything by the rules. That's the good part of the movie. The girls lure Evan into the bathroom where he gives in and schtups the two flirty sirens, and things go downhill from there, as the film degenerates into a kind of torture-revenge comedy designed to punish Evan for fooling around. That's not exactly unexpected, of course. But the film collapses, because it doesn't convince us on a basic level: The characters are driven by convenience, not behavior, and their actions seem like they've been manhandled into place to make the plot work. Roth also never captures the dangerous tone required to make us feel in any way invested in what's happening onscreen. Even at their worst, those grindhouse movies he loves and references had an unhinged quality that made it seem like anything was possible, like in watching them we'd entered a world without any rules. Knock Knock, by contrast, is a disaster and inane. At no point do Genesis or Bel feel like actual human beings; they are unhinged one-dimensional lascivious cartoons with ridiculous, belly-laughing motivation. As soon as the morning comes, Genesis and Bel have transformed from seductive and coy young adults to infantilized and highly sexualized bratty teenage harlots. Our reintroduction involves both ladies filling the kitchen with breakfast supplies and throwing food around, laughing obnoxiously, and practically bouncing off the walls. Their initial disgust includes mooning Evan while he's on a Skype call and drawing penises on his wife's art. When a concerned neighbor stops by I was hoping for something a little more serious and dangerous, but they can't even do that, which is what makes their late turn into would-be murderers to be completely unbelievable and forced. It's so forced that Reeve's sputtering monologue of incredulity pretty much sums up the point of view of any rational viewer. They play dress up and appear to have some psychosexual daddy issues, possibly resulting from childhood abuse or molestation, but at no point do they come across as a credible menace. Then there's the conclusion and justification for their so-called act of payback and it's so lame and uninspired and a copout that you wish Roth would go back to American Horror Story or Cabin Fever."

10.0,26 June 2023,Knock Knock was an ultimately average to below average thriller that I was so excited for and had much more potential. Ei Roth is known for his gory twisted horror movies and this one was certainly twisted but not nearly to the level I was expecting. The story line was just very disjointed and at times it was hard to watch.. like a bad car accident that you couldn't look away from. I just feel like there was so much more potential here but it wasn't tapped into with the writing or acting. I still enjoyed it and it was certainly different and entertaining overall so it's worth the watch if you like these kinds of movies.
1.0,25 October 2015,"Probably only if you like Keanu or Eli Roth, would you ever watch this film. Either way, you know what you are going to get. Bad acting, confusing plot, with a few interesting scenes and scenarios.

Well, unfortunately, you only get 1/2 your expectations.

The premise is ridiculous, a father of the year candidate is 'accosted' by 2 unbelievably good looking woman (or are they only girls, sorry to ruin the hugely irreverent plot twist) who want to have sex with him and make super fun parties. The one true shining star of this movie is the charisma of its 2 lead actresses, Lorenza Izzo and Ana de Armas. Both take a terrible script and baffling directing choices and were the only reason I did not turn the movie off immediately.

Reeves who is a perennial Razzy contender might finally snag one with his 'performance' in this film.

An Eli Roth movie will have gruesome violence, mixed in with a sense of humour and push boundaries. This movie is lazy, and neither promises or delivers anything.

We enter this movie with questions such as, ""What is going to happen?"" We end with the question, ""What the hell just happened?"" The acting of the leading ladies raises this movie from a 3 to a 4. Watch on fast forward!"
2.0,29 July 2020,"The message of the movie is pretty interesting, and one I do agree with.

Everything else seemed pretty cheap. The beginning was interesting, but it seemed to drag on for more than half the movie. Felt like watching a cheap porno. The second half, the torture was not particularly terrifying and the actions of the characters were neither here nor there. Also Keanu Reeves was not very convincing in the film.

Hard Candy did a much better (and terrifying) job of exploring the shallowness of man(kind), so I would suggest that over Knock Knock. Overall though, the movie was an interesting watch and definitely different to most films currently out there. So, if you're bored with the regular thrillers, this might just be for you."

1.0,22 September 2016,"Remember When We All Thought Eli Roth Was Going to Be The Next Wes Craven?

Knock Knock (2016) Review/Rant

Remember when we all though writer, producer, and director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever, Hostel) was going to be the next Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream)? His early films, like Cabin Fever and Hostel, were fun, scary, funny, and Eli Roth had an amazing start and career into the world of horror films.

Fast forward a few years, and I now have a love hate relationship with this person. Aftershock was in my opinion a decent film the first time I saw it. After viewing it again, the film is not as good. It is pretty much the cast of the Hangover in a very mediocre horror film. The Green Inferno, could have been so much more. However, from what he delivered, I thought once again it was just decent. I actually like Eli Roth; he is one of my favorite directors, seems like a cool guy, reminds me of myself in a way, he is a good writer, and has a passion for the art of film.

However, Knock Knock is one of the worst ""horror"" films I have seen in a long time. Eli Roth was the master of horror at one point in his career. Now, he can make, star, write, and produce a movie and no one cares! With all due respect, what happened?! Who is to Blame?

Ever since 2012, Eli Roth has collaborated himself with the same cast and crew of people. I do not know if it is his partnership with Nicolas Lopez that has lead to his downfall, or Mr. Roth himself. Aftershock, The Green Inferno, Knock Knock, the remake of Cabin Fever, have all suffered horribly, and the positive ratings just get lower and lower. They actually cannot get any lower; the remake of Cabin Fever has a zero percent on Rotten Tomatoes!

Knock Knock is the worst film he has done! If I were him, I would go back to my roots of filmmaking. I am not going to get deep into the plot, because it is not worth talking about.

The film is poorly written, the acting is atrocious (especially by Keanu Reeves), the young girls come off as annoying instead of horrifying, it is not scary, it is cheesy, and just bad. Instead of writing good material for Reeves that makes him interesting and or relatable, they take the easy way out. We are suppose to like him because, he has a nice suburban home, gets his family portraits done at the local Sears, we have many family pictures on the wall, the camera many zooms through the interior of the house showing you more pictures of the family, it is father's day and he is a father, we play sappy music, and from that we are suppose to like him/understand him? It is lazy, badly written, and the filmmakers saying, ""The audience will like him, because he has a family, and the viewer has a family too"". The only two things I liked was the song at the end. The Pixies – ""where is my mind?"" it made me think of the ending to Fight Club, a much better movie. Also, the actress Ana de Armas. She was actually a good actress, she tried, talented, she has nice eyes, and is easy on the eyes.

I do not think this movie is worth viewing ever again! The movie is so bad, that we were literally laughing our butts off. I do not like ranting on movies and the talented hardworking people behind them, because I respect the art form. On the other hand, this is not worth viewing even on a bad movie night. This film could have been so much more; it could have been like Hard Candy's demonic cousin. Overall, I believe this film earns a

Its nothing here qualifying to call it a horror movie, but its for sure a thriller/drama movie.. The acting was rather good, atleast whit the errors there must have been in the screenplay.

The rest of the movie was okay. I'm sure Keanu Reeves was disappointed in the end result, but hey, you just don't know until the final product comes out.

I realize that the intent was to create a movie that both tantalized and ""horrifying"" at the same time but in the end it sort of just fell flat. I did like the final line of the movie however. Leave us hope that this family will overcome.

The only thing that would make this an overall worthwhile experience would be to have a sequel entitled ""Who's There?"" where he takes his revenge later in life in an intelligent and creative way. Call me Eli. I have some ideas (941) 227-3529. David"

I enjoy the thriller genre and Eli Roth has made some artistic and well executed films in this field. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I watched this movie on DVD and watched ""the making of"" featurette, in order to understand what the people involved were attempting to create. In one word, art, seemed to be the intent. Both director and writers speak of creating suspense and psychological intensity, neither of which this film offers. As with many movies as of late, the best intentions of those involved, end up being driven by their own ego and ultimately making a film that is just huge disappointment for an audience member. There is nothing artistic or poignant about this drivel. It just ends up being absurd and flat. A character driven story, with characters so cartoonish in nature, I kept waiting for Batman to make an appearance. At least then, there would have been a character with some small amount of intrigue to hold my interest. The acting is quite good, despite an awful script, which is the only reason this picture was given more than 1 star. But hey, at least I had time to finish a rather difficult sudoku puzzle."

Posting the video of them having sex on Facebook can happen to anyone. The stuff that goes on with facebook is why I do not have an account. He is a good actor, but I lost interest in this movie quickly. Skanks that hit on married men and play games like that are not for me.

I thought I would give the Keanu Reeves vehicle ""Knock Knock"" a shot. So I did. I now wish to beat hell that I would have shot down this abundantly ill-advised notion the instant it germinated.

This purported thriller was silly, superfluous, banal and just plain BAD beyond all reason. There was but a solitary redeeming element in this entire merciless mess for me. And that pertains to the pair of young actresses who starred in the movie upon which this disaster was based, 1977's ""Death Game"", which I saw, liked and was shaken by for days. ""Knock Knock"" was Exec Produced by Sondra Locke and features a brief cameo from Colleen Camp, the two women who played the pair of deeply disturbed yet ravishingly beautiful home invaders of a well-to-do suburban family man left all by his lonesome nearly 40 years ago. Why they would tarnish the genuinely terrifying work they delivered then to be part of this trashy tripe is simply beyond me.

Knock knock.

It ends into be a stupid thriller based on some kind of strange semi-moral lessons to be learned. It fails anyhow to be credible because of a really unbelievable bad plot development. It starts quite good and has some succeeded moments in the beginning. This ends really soon and start being really forced and artificial into narration. One wife overwhelmed by artist life rigors and kid's related responsibilities is urged ""to the beach"" for the weekend, leaving behind a devoted husband, a busy architect and a sexually frustrated 43 years old guy. Some maniacal girls pop up to his door, get invited inside and force him into having sex with. Then they decide to punish the unfaithful husband and presumed pedophile father. This part is really mental, but this is not the worst aspect. It is really not credible. Has nothing in common with real human behavior in the context. The end is hilarious, even more than the strange guy popping in at a point in time just to get killed for some wrongly added ""tension"". I could watch sometime a bad movie (kind of third category), if it at least deliver the normal dose of assumed absurd. This is a bad movie delivering half dose of stupid happening. Avoid!"

Not as good as I was hoping it would be. I thought this movie would be more suspenseful, instead it was just a movie about a guy who makes a stupid decision to open this door to two girls, while he is home alone.

I should say This film is weird. A loving husband invites two young women in to call for Uber after getting lost in the pouring rain. What follows next is something no self-respecting family man would do and the women make him pay for this action.

and Keanu...

Keanu is one of my favorite actors and he was OK in this movie. In the beginning it kind of felt like a little Ted came back, but man... towards the end when he was screaming and trying to get away you could tell he was struggling trying to find his acting skills. The plot was strange and yes it was sometimes entertaining and only had a few slow spots. I still love you Keanu!"

Eli Roth? Awesome. Scantily clad/nude hot girls? Yes, please. Keanu Reeves? Dope. I actually liked the ending, that last line was the perfect way to end the film, and I'm so glad they didn't go with the alternative ending in the special features. Did this movie take things a little too far? That's debatable, but I was down for the ride from the get-go, and this movie left me wanting more. I'll hold my hopes for a Knock Knock 2, because I'm assuming that will never happen. This movie may not be for everyone, but it most certainly was for me. Prudes, be warned: this is one movie that refuses to bite its tongue."

I won't repeat what a whole lot of fellow audience members have already said... so, here's a sum up:

Worthless piece... I wasted my time! Now I know I have to stay away from anything by Eli Roth for good.

Go and watch ""Hard Candy"" instead. At least you've got Ellen Page on it.

*Oh great, IMDb's system requires that at least 10 lines of text have to be written.

Here I go again, then:

Don't go see this. It's garbage. Sex scenes are nothing that you can't watch on TV nowadays. Horror? There's none - oh, just the fact that you keep checking your watch every 10 minutes or so to estimate how long is it going to take for it to end.

Painful watch. Really. Stay out of it. Don't complain you haven't been warned after wards.

Good luck."

4.0,26 July 2019,"I liked the movie beginning, that family moment and seeing Keanu Reeves playing the role of a father and family man ... really made me happy somehow :D

From a good start turned into a mediocre movie. Two random girls on a rainy day knocked at his door, he let them in and just tried to help them, he did what a good man will do, well they were pretty cute so this was an advantage probably. But after that the girls were way too pushy, and started acting weird, and finished with them naked in his bathroom, and his reaction was way to off.

Both of them had psychopathic tendencies, and killed that poor dude that helped his wife with that art thing, and kept laughing about and staging him for his murder, all of this was to prove that all men are alike and non will refuse them, while they practically force them to have sex with both of them.

Really bad idea of movie, this is my honest opinion, I don't know what was in the head of director that greenlight this idea of movie, surely in this world there are viewers that loved the movie, but no me.

I'll give a 3 / 10 stars, but I still think is too much, but because of Keanu, i'll stick with 3 / 10 stars. :)

Started so good, I was so excited ... then started to bore me, and the fact that he didn't killed them really disappointed me, maybe if he would kill them and get rid of bodies or burry them in his yard and the end to be like ""wife and kids coming home finding him working or cleaning the house and he would've been all smile and stuff"" that would've been a perfect ending and the movie would get 6-7 stars, but with that ending and that idea, is pathetic."

Truly, there is nothing to this movie at all. You're never really routing for anyone; there's no background or proper setup for any of the three main characters. Additionally, the improbable circumstances just pile up higher and higher. This isn't even a movie, it's more like a feminist's wet dream - seeing a hapless good man go bad at the hands of two girls. The cap goes on the feminist jar when one of them says, ""You're all the same."" Eli, you disgust me. ""Hostel"" was just shy of a snuff film, and this is just sick; it has no place in modern cinema. Eli Roth must be one really messed up person to have come up with this, and then spend millions making it. To twist the knife, he made a lot of money off of this crapshoot too. Avoid it like the plague!"

4.0,15 November 2015,"If there was ever any doubt that director Eli Roth is a misogynist then Knock Knock absolutely confirms it. His portrayal of woman in his films have been appalling in the past but what we see in this movie is staggering . This is the story of family man Evan Webber ( Keanu Reeves ) , who while his wife and kids are away , has a knock on the door from two young woman looking for help . The turn out to be Evan's worst nightmare. Despite Keanu Reeves typically wooden acting I actually didn't mind the first forty minutes of this. It's only when the girls start to go nuts that film immediately falls apart. The problem is Why? What is the motive of these girls? It's never explained despite a spurious "" catch a predator"" line ( which makes no sense ) as to why these girls terrorise Webber. Eli Roth not only turns these female characters into nasty , violent , sex machines he also treats the audience like idiots . This is classed as a Horror film but I would describe it as horrible."

1.0,25 October 2015,"This movie had a lot of potential to be quite good but didn't capitalize on it. The way it was shot made it look like it was a big budget Hollywood movie and though it takes place in one main setting, you never really notice because of all the crazy things going on. Unfortunately, that's where the good points about this movie end. There were a few points in the movie (the beginning, the middle, and the end) where little hints were dropped to explain the plot of the movie, but all were so brief it was easy to miss them, and if you did catch them they didn't tie in together well enough to explain what was going on and why it was happening.

Moving right along to the acting -- more disappointment. Keanu Reeve's takes the blame here! His acting was so awkwardly bad it completely overshadowed everyone else's like a huge dark cloud and took away from the intensity of the movie. Imagine watching an emotionally intense scene that would normally make you cringe, but instead you can't help but laugh because of his terrible acting.

This movie is definitely not for movie buffs who enjoy movies with well written plots and great acting, they'll want to skip this one; but if you want a good laugh on a Saturday night you'll want to watch this with a group of friends. Sorry Keanu."

It starts off slow and doesn't really get into it until after the hour mark, the girls you see in the trailer have no real motive to do what they do (not in my eyes anyway). They prey on married men seductively and hope they say yes to their advances to then ruin the mens lives.

Keanue Reeves performed disappointingly as the type of acting on all parts reminded me of several B rated thriller/dramas with a low budget.

I also do not really like Keanu Reeves, since I believe he is a one note ""actor"" who can only play one role. Against my better judgment I decided to give this film a chance, and I wanted to punch every involved in this travesty. This movie is so freaking ludicrous, as to make any socially conscious man angry. Why is it that men are always portrayed as villains? Is it our fault that we take the initiative to get s#!t done? We are the inventors, the explorers, the ones who risk our lives to save the lives of others.Yet we have a movie like this one that spits on everything men have done to simply slight them, and why? This movie made me angry because it caters to the simple minded feminist mentality; instead of trying to place blame on any one specific group, these people need to look introspectively and deconstruct everything they have been taught to believe by those around them. It doesn't even work as witty social commentary. It is Tyler Perry's ""Man Hating Film #8 directed by Eli Roth"". Don't waste your time."

The movie's message of staying faithful and cheating on your spouse isn't worth the potential consequences is a great one because anyone who thinks of cheating after seeing this movie is an idiot and a glutton for punishment but even the message wasn't enough to give the movie a rating higher than a 5!

It seems the actresses were left alone and they were not able to develop their characters on their own. The storyline is pretty decent, being a spin off of Michael Haneke ""Funny Games"". If already seen this movie you know what to expect. The main difference is that you what that erotic twist which is a nice approach. Eli Roth should know better that the girls are fundamental to the success of the movie. Due to the lack of attention to acting the result is a dull character development."

1.0,19 October 2015,"The first thing that struck me negatively in this movie was the bad acting. Before I noticed that, the story failed here & there but one never knows if it's for later plot-twist or maybe just my mood. However one shouldn't put so much blame for bad acting on the actors as ultimately, the responsible of a movie is the director; I don't care if his casting failed and by the time he realized the actors were not he expected the movie already started or worse, he neglected to direct them, the responsibility remains.

The story wasn't the best in this setting but with afterthought, with a few modifications to it, but serious direction changes, the movie could have been respectable IMHO.

Keanu Reeves is known for his intense roles, which he stay faithful to. I don't know why he chose to play in this mediocre movie and the mediocre one about samurais. If he spits on elitism to cater to one's career at the detriment of one's craft, I'm all for it (not doing something one love just to increase one market value must suck). If he's desperate and the vast majority of the movie he's going to appear in is mediocre, I better catch on and start avoiding what he's in."

Never, never, not remotely, that happens. In particular, I never thought I could see such a bad acting from a person who is paid to act. In any moment of the film I felt that Keannu Reeves was a family man nor that he was in danger. His rage against the girls is nothing more than a guy reading lines in the script as if he was having a beer. The emotion is equivalent to a 6 year old reading loud in the classroom. I don't know if it's director fault or lack of talent but it's awful."

When young women appear on your doorstep it usually means your online luring has worked.

Oddly, the family man in this thriller hasn't been to any online chat rooms lately.

Happily married Evan (Keanu Reeves) stays home to nurse his injured shoulder while his wife (Ignacia Allamand) and children go to the beach for the weekend.

His recuperation, however, is interrupted by a knock at the door that later finds him playing host to soaking wet airline stewardesses, Genesis (Lorenza Izzo) and Bel (Ana de Armas), who got lost on their way to a party.

Evan is easily seduced. He wakes the next morning to find the girls have taken him hostage, and are vandalizing his home.

Featuring Keanu's worst performance ever, this erotic cautionary tale fails to be the feminist think piece it hopes. Instead it's a far-fetched and laughable remake.

Besides, morning-after breakfast gets really expensive with threesomes.

This film is just so bad, I can't believe I have to keep using characters to do a review for it.

At any point in this film Keanu's character could have removed the two girls. The idea that they could over power him was just absolutely ridiculous even with his stupid shoulder injury.

This movie was way over the top, pathetic and Roth can do so much better.

I just don't understand the point of it.

1.0,31 October 2017,"The hate this movie has gotten is completely undeserved. This is a solid horror movie, though unconventional. People making comparisons to Funny Games completely missed the point of the movie. Seems the wrong people went to see this movie--in large part, perhaps, because Keanu's in it. Those folks should have known better based on the trailer and director. Disappointed Eli fans are likely too young or lacking in life experience to appreciate this.

Eli and the cast did an excellent job on the movie. It's about a good family man--yes, good--who finds himself in an unlikely sexual fantasy scenario, and despite several attempts to beat temptation, eventually gives in, risking to ruin his life, and bring shame onto himself and his family. This is a super relatable worst fear, particularly for husbands and wives with families.

What I found especially disturbing was how, when you really think about it, very little pressure and/or seduction was needed to make him cave. And I think the majority of men in his situation-- otherwise good, disciplined men--would fare no better. Sure, it's easy to avoid temptations that aren't there, but what if they fall into your lap with the promise of secrecy?

No doubt, this movie will make many people uncomfortable. It's good."

If I were in Keanu Reeves' position I would've just taken a golf club to their faces. Anyway, the trailer tried to pass this off as a thriller, which it hardly can call itself thrilling. I expected something dark, twisted, one reviewer went as far to call it ""morbid"" - well it isn't. If you watch it on mute you might manage to find some enjoyment in it, I laughed at the man's reactions cause Keanu Reeves is just entertaining to watch for some reason. He plays ""world's greatest dad"" and loving husband, who turns into a victim of seduction and mild torture. The ending was very satisfying considering most of the movie has you waiting for something cool to happen. It ends very comically, a part you might want to rewind and watch again. As a whole though, the film is pretty amateur at best."
1.0,14 October 2015,"Like myself and many others you would've watched this with the anticipation of seeing Keanu Reeves in a new film. Unfortunately, even Mr Reeves couldn't save this bloody awful movie.

To call it a horror/thriller/mystery is completely misleading. It is simply an hour-and-a-half long piece of predictable, cringe-worthy garbage which irked me to my core. I found myself screaming internally and sighing heavily through the first part of this movie. (Not including the introduction to his family, which was sickeningly cute but bearable). Instead of enduring the length of this movie though I decided to turn it off. But curiosity got the better of me, so I put it back on and skipped through the last part of it.

If I had known how much of a waste of time this movie was going to be, I would've skipped to the end at the start. The entire movie is right there in the last 5 minutes. You don't even need to watch the movie, except for those 5 minutes, and you would've seen the entire thing. Well, you probably don't actually need to watch it, period.

So, if you're thinking right now this movie can't be THAT bad and there must be SOMETHING in it that's watchable, trust me and these other reviewers, there isn't. Skip to the last 5 minutes and save yourself the headache."

Almost all of the lines are so cringe that I just wanted to roll my eyes far into the back of my skull, not to mention how pathetic the main character is. He keeps being overpowered by 2, sometimes even just 1 supposedly 15 year olds (as if), who couldn't be scary or threatening to save their lives. The more the film progresses the worse it gets, if you want to be motivated to slam your head into a wall I recommend this 10/10"
3.0,11 October 2024,"I cannot say I liked this movie in the usual sense of ""liking,"" and I agree it is a film that will make most people angry. Basically, the plot unfolds as an allegory, and the two young ladies actually are fallen angels that have taken on a ""pleasing shape"" so that they can deceive and seduce Keanu Reeves' character, lead him into adultery, and destroy his home, his personal paradise or Garden of Eden.

Please note the one young lady's name is Genesis, the name of the first book of the Bible, which tells the story of the Garden of Eden and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve. In this instance, ""Adam"" is alone, and his attraction to the creatures who appear as beautiful young women is his downfall.

When the two women appear on his doorstep, they lie about a cab driver who drove off and left them and also about the Garritys' party they had planned to attend in the neighborhood. They use feminine wiles to persuade the man to let them into his home, and everything is a lie. After all, Satan is the ""Father of Lies,"" and a lie is at the root of every sin or crime.

The man offers to dry the women's rain-soaked clothes in the dryer, and he gives them gleaming white robes, the usual attire of angels, to wear while the dryer is running. However, remember that they are fallen angels who have crept into the home. Their very liberal talk about sex and their brazen boldness in seducing the man lead to his downfall and the actual destruction of his home, his ""paradise""

In the course of the conversation, they mention that they never sleep and that they travel all the time, with their previous visit being in New Zealand. In connection with this, think of the saying ,""Satan never sleeps,"" and Satan's own admission in the Bible that he constantly goes to and fro in the earth because these sayings tell the tale on the two women.

At the end, the man drives the two women to the next ""target"" house where their next intended victim lives. From this, the viewer can surmise that their story about being left by the cab driver was a lie and that a previous victim had dumped them on the doorstep..

It is a film that made me angry, but I quickly recognized its being an allegory about evil spirits, the fall of man, and the destruction of paradise. Seeing the film is like seeing a train wreck; a person hates to see it, and yet the person is led to keep watching to see how bad it can get. The film is an excellent depiction of how evil, deception, and temptation work, but I definitely would not want to see it again. It quite frankly makes a person angry and gives a person the ""creeps."" It probably is the best depiction of evil and demon possession I have seen since the TV movie, ""The Bermuda Triangle."""

1.0,19 October 2018,"This movie is a blatant rip-off of the 1977 film, Death Games. However, it pales in comparison, and the acting of Keanu Reeves was rather shoddy to say the least. I forced myself to sit through all 99 minutes of this rubbish only because I was curious to see how much of the other movie's plot they were going to steal."

4.0,3 November 2020,I'm just going to chalk this up as Keanu Reeves was desperate for a paycheck. I felt as though I was on some weird acid trip lolll. They should move this right on over to comedy bc it was definitely a scream... a scream of cringy laughter lol.
5.0,6 September 2024,"The direction, the writing and the acting, not that Keanu is known for his good acting, but there were a few exceptions in his career he did fine, this was not one of them.

Never once believed his family was his family, the way he spoke to his kids is not something a dad does, it was sooo over the top playful and ""daddy-like"" it came across as phony, nor did I believe he would ever marry that woman playing his wife. Not with that accent? She was a favor-hire for sure, and I know it likely helped she is the daughter of the former Chilean Minister of Defense and former Presidential candidate Andrés Allamand Zaval.

Oh right, she was co-writer and co-producer, likely raised some of the money herself to get a part.

Or maybe someone provided funds for the movie to have her in it, which happens way more than you think in the film industry. Woody Allen made a film called Bullets over Broadway about it.

Nor did believe for a second that these two hot girls randomly showed up at his house and decided to torture him for a game. I mean, WHAT?

Not a single likable character in the film, not even Keanu who cheated on his wife and betrayed his family.

And of course there is always a DEI hire which never actually fits in there.

And Keanu was a DJ? I mean, really?

Then Keanu plays a 50 at the time, played a 43-year-old, but the worse part is we are supposed to believe he believed they were both underage, both were 26 at the time. None of them looked under 22. So like really?

This movie was RIDICULOUS!!"

1.0,15 January 2021,"I did not enjoy this movie and do not need to watch it again, but it was an effective movie. This is how I feel about almost all of Eli Roth's films, which are mostly depraved, but force you to look at tough moral quandries.

Even the most milquetoast individuals, portrayed very well in this case by Keanu, have insane fantasies that look something like the first 20 minutes of this movie. The rest of this movie shows what happens when we indulge those fantasies; usually depravity and horror ensues. Maybe you glance at your wife with a smile while you're really thinking about hooking up with the hot girl in the yoga pants...Have you ever followed that scenario to its logical conclusion? What would you stand to lose? This movie, while almost absurdly overdone, makes you wonder.

There are also subtle winks and nods to the debauchery of Hollywood and how they ""use girls"" and toss them aside. This is interesting because it was right only a year or two before news about Weinstein finally broke out. You have to wonder if Roth was signaling some disdain with the perverse Hollywood crowd. Maybe that's a reach.

To the mechanics of the film, the plot is insanely far fetched and aside from Keanu, the acting was awful."

3.0,2 August 2019,"Having recently seen both John Wick films I was in a Keanu Reeves fan mood when I came across this movie on HBO. The premise sounded interesting. OK. So Keanu's character is supposed to be a young father with an adoring wife and kids and a great career. The film starts with an awkward seduction attempt by his wife that is interrupted by the overly-zealous kids showing up at the bedroom door. Keanu wants to continue later but is shot down even though ""it's been threeee weeks!"" Uh, oh. I hope no willing women show up at his door. Conveniently. the wife and kids are leaving town for the weekend and Keanu is left home alone. (It's ok to picture him with his hands on his cheeks here because it's kinda like that) This is when 2 young women show up at his door during a storm, wet and giggling. ""oh, no one else is around."" ""oh, they don't know their own telephone numbers."" OOPSIE! I can see where this is going. This film has more 1-star reviews then any I've ever looked up.Between that and the terrible, horrible, no-good acting from Mr Reeves I decide it's best to just turn this thing off and end it now. I know the ending from the other reviews and also know that MANY people share my disappointment with Keanu's acting as well as the abysmal Direction by Eli Roth. I always felt his ""Hostel"" films were way too sick for me and even though this movie has little of the gore it has the same psycho-sexual sickness and I'm just better off without it. I hope you are too. Avoid this movie."

5.0,6 November 2020,"Keenu Reeves and Ana De Armas have been great in some of my favorite sci-fi movies... so I was expecting a lot from this. However, when the opening credits showed Eli Roth... I wondered if it would be another groaner, and I was right.

It's top few qualities are some moments of believable passion from Lorenza Izza, and a stomach-twisting premise that should shoot fear and self-inspection into the heart of every man, but they're bowled over by the dumbed-down dialog and erratic pacing, crescendoed by Reeves over-the-top yelling.

Not even De Armas' beauty or the sleekness of the production and Reeves' Wick-like demeanor could save many minutes of this cliche-driveling B-movie in A-list garb. If you like the actors, Roth's movies (*shudder*), or cheesy psycho movies from the 70s, I suppose you'll get a kick out of this... but for me there's just too much camp and poorly-thought-out writing to keep me from laughing at parts that probably weren't meant to be funny. I should probably stop expecting The Bear Jew to show his supposed genius, and I've disliked everything he's done except for Cabin Fever, which I actually found more entertaining than this, and which I was reminded of several times due to Roth's recognizable camp. At least that camp was more fun then even if just as stupid; maybe Roth should stop trying so hard and make parody horror. Maybe that's what he does? :/ I'm still super-disappinted."

1.0,29 January 2024,"Some of the worst writing i've ever seen in a movie, especially with Keanu Reeves. The whole premise of this movie is goofy and should've been over within 15 minutes. In real life, you would've just called the police without even a second thought and the police would've come and taking them away. Easily defensible, and there is no chance you would've been convicted for statutory rape, given all the circumstances. Just a bizarre movie, this felt more like a horny teenager made a fantasy film and then desperately tried to make it believable. Short answer, he could not and this entire film is just one sex scene mixed with complete and utter garbage. That is so unbelievable that it drifted away from goofy and just became annoying. I'm very sorry I wasted the 20 minutes that I watched of this trash."
3.0,6 November 2020,"So you've read the plot, two girls seduce a middle age man. He resists, then resists some more, then some more... until, while going to kick them out he walks into a bubble bath and what I would call rape if the genders were reversed. - eventually succumbing to the rape and participating willingly.

For this, the girls torture him, destroy his home, run his wife's art and paper machete his presumably dead friend and then leave. We never find out why they do this. Beautiful 20 somethings have nothing better to do than commit the following crimes: assault, battery, rape, hostage taking, breaking and entering, vandalism, and a plethora of other laws all just to risk being killed inside middle aged mens homes for no reason other than to prove they can rape men and call them dogs. Trash. Give me some motive some reason they do this..

We never find out how or why they spied on him prior to showing up, despite a scene where they quote a phrase he uses with his kids.. and admit to soying on him. They mention in a line about him being part of the 1%, is this part of the motive?-or just another throw away trash line. The plot made little to no sense. Many characters were unnecessary small roles in scenes that could've been skipped, added no value or connection. I believe they tried to make a new wave version of Fatal Attraction. They missed the mark.- by a lot.

I've seen movies much worse, but not many as unexplained and unrealistic. -the latter is saying something as we are talking about Hollywood here."

The characters are unbelievable and lifeless, awful acting and awful plot . Why would someone seek out for ""revenge"" and then basically ruin all the wife's and kids stuff? Making the girls seem crazy for no reason and giving them no backstory whatsoever not even explaining if they had trauma to behave like that. Unbelievable how this script went through and I hope to god this director never touches a movie again.

Steer away from this movie because this was just visual trash."

The two womens who undressed themselves and try to seduce the husband. Its not really interesting: i mean in horror or other thing. Its a nice way to see Ana de Armas naked by the way.

Im now wondering the logic of Netflix to recommend this to me and my family but it should be a crime. Towards the last 85 minutes my wife had to fast forward just to see what happened and it just got worse. Pray that Keanu to finds a better agent that will recommend him not to do movies like this. I really debated to post because if you don't have anything nice to say to don't say anything....but...I feel like I lost time in my life.

But I guess I have my self to blame for continuing to watch it. It's hard to enjoy a movie when the characters are flat and have no development; the characters seem to not have any impetus for their actions; and act completely ridiculous and non-sensical. Yes characters can be psychotic, but give them some depth and motivation to make them believable. I ended up fast forwarding it to the end it see what happens and the conclusion was just as ridiculous, inconsequential for everyone involved, and anti-climactic. It made me wonder why any actor would want to portray this story, especially with how much ridiculous vigour the actors did it with, or why anyone would want to produce or direct this movie.

4.0,4 November 2015,"I feel like there is a certain line that you just don't cross but this movie crosses it anyways. Eli Roth is known to make some controversial stuff. You could say that might even be part of his genius. However, this was just too much. I enjoyed Cabin Fever, I enjoyed Hemlock Grove, and I knew they weren't meant to be taken seriously. I didn't get that feeling with Knock Knock. I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Keanu Reeves is a terrific actor. We can't really hate on him for this movie turning out the way it did. My problem isn't with the acting or the story. If anything I thought both were really good. That doesn't take away from the fact that this movie made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I felt terrible after watching it. Thats not why we watch movies is it? A movie is supposed to make you feel excited and have fun. I mean, come on. There were some things in this movie that could have been left out or done differently. My problem is that this movie is nothing but pure evil. I think it's disgusting. If you scroll down to the soundtrack there is a song called ""talking to the devil"" performed by Sorcery. If Hollywood really wants to be that demonic I guess this is where I start to tune out as a viewer. I might not ever look at an Eli Roth project the same again. Is he in the movie making business or the devil worshiping business? Because im really upset about what I saw here. My 5/10 rating only goes to the art form of telling a story and the acting that went into it. This doesn't excuse the evil behind Knock Knock at all. If you haven't watched it yet please stay far away from it. Im gonna have to spend next Sunday in church after seeing this film. Totally disgusting."

5.0,24 April 2024,"Yeah, yeah. Bad remakes are a dime a dozen, but sue me, I actually LIKE Eli Roth. Especially his straight-up horror (with a healthy dose of black humor). Why was I embarrassed throughout this movie, from start to finish?

I have to assume this character and part were out of Keanu Reeves' comfort zone. While I commend Reeves for braving it, at the same time, this is such a colossally poor performance. It's like he's acting under duress. Someone's got a gun off-camera, repeatedly urging him to ACT! The godawful writing is not helping him, but this is easily the worst performance I've seen him give. Then again, if you're a fan of unintentional laughs, Keanu provides. Oh yeah, check out his DJ skills! How hip.

Aw, who am I kidding? This whole movie is miscast! The young ladies bring nothing, except brattiness. Yes, Ana De Armas is drop-dead gorgeous, and you not only see her soaped-up naked, but there's an up-the-skirt shot as well (yes, I take note of these things). But putting pretty people in your movie does not necessarily guarantee you a good film. And it took three guys to write this tripe (based on an already existing premise).

Roth based his movie on his love for Death Game (1977). The references and parallels to that movie are pretty incessant, only, you know, worse. There's one reference, featured prominently, then brought up again at the end, IN CASE YOU MISSED IT, that refers to Death Game's ORIGINAL, unfilmed ending! Like, it won't even make sense to most people, it's on for a preposterous amount of time, and the only people who know it watched the Grindhouse Releasing Blu-ray extras, or are familiar with the history of the movie. Whoops, wasted a paragraph on that. My point is supposed to be, Knock Knock is not even a smart or clever (or subtle) remake. Much of it is blatant plagiarism, only this one has no point!

I highly recommend Death Game, and if you're into pure exploitation, its predecessor is Little Miss Innocence (1973). Neither are masterpieces (Roth would disagree), but they're sure as hell better written, and certainly better acted (Death Game has nice cinematography too). What's funny is, Little Miss Innocence stars porn actors, and directed by a porn director! All outperforming the actors, writers, and director of Knock Knock. You heard me.

There's an alternate ending on the Blu-ray, listed under deleted scenes, yet seemingly filmed well after production (I'm not even sure they got the same actresses), that's a reference to... John Wick! This would've made a great stinger. Especially considering this turkey ends on a bad joke. I love it when bad movies resort to referring to much, much better ones.

I recognized 4 names as producers, from Death Game, on Knock Knock. Like, why? Was Roth owed favors? Did they read the script? Colleen Camp appears in the movie briefly."

The only positive thing I remember is the length of the movie - it's short. It has a small curiosity, which is the inconsistency of the location and nationality of the characters. The film was made in Chile but, apparently, it intends to take place in California, but the characters behave as if they were on vacation in Madrid.

The one dimensional characters lack some depth but the acting is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be, in fact that's not something that even crossed my mind during my viewing.

This film takes the tried and true home invasion formula and flips it, putting the two beautiful young starlets in the roll of the predators opposed to the prey. Let me stress this is a psychological thriller not your classic horror movie, so if you're looking for scary bumps in the night or the gore fest you may have come to expect from Eli Roth you're going to be very disappointed. That being said this story actually starts out pretty strong, suspense and tension build as Reeves does his best to be a good samaritan and also avoid temptation while the audience attempts to discover the seductive duos true intentions.

After our protagonist ultimately succumbs to his temptations is where the film begins falling short. The sexy duo that were shrouded in mystery devolve into annoying childlike crazies that sort of lack the intimidating feel they had when they were introduced soaking wet and unannounced. Not to say there aren't a couple quality scenes between this turn and the end of the movie, the one where Ana de Armas adorns a school girl uniform is particularly uncomfortable, but they ultimately can't save the film from becoming predictable. As Reeves idealistic life continues unraveling to the point which it may be unsalvageable our intruders are revealed to have no real connection to him at all, but rather have seem to found him by sheer luck.

My interpretation of Roth's lesson is that one shameful choice, despite the lengths gone through to cover it up, can reduce someone who seemingly has everything to nothing at all. For me the film was entertaining overall but I guess I was waiting for a twist or reveal that never came, all that suspense ultimately waisted."

Keanu Reeves Ana de Armas are the only things good in this movie, the rest is horrible, doesn't deserve even a star . I feel bad because such good actors ware wasted in one of the most horrible movies ever made in history of cinema.

This movie was to be buried and never ever heard or seen by anyone ever again. I hope this review will help you don't make the mistake I did.

I hate it because it has no end and the suspense is terrible because it leads nowhere.

I hope there is never a sequel."
3.0,23 March 2024,"---

""Knock Knock"" (2015) is a film that squanders its potential at every turn. Directed by Eli Roth and starring Keanu Reeves, the movie presents a promising premise but ultimately fails to deliver on its initial intrigue.

The story follows Evan Webber (Reeves), a family man left alone for the weekend. When two young women, Genesis and Bel, show up on his doorstep seeking shelter from a storm, Evan's quiet night takes a dark turn. What begins as a seemingly innocent encounter quickly devolves into a nightmarish ordeal as the women unleash chaos upon Evan's life.

One of the film's most significant flaws is its lack of character development. Evan is a shallow protagonist, devoid of any real depth or complexity. Reeves does his best with the material he's given, but ultimately, his performance is hindered by a script that fails to provide him with anything substantial to work with. Genesis and Bel, meanwhile, are little more than stereotypes - femme fatales with no real motivations or inner lives.

The dialogue in ""Knock Knock"" is equally disappointing. Instead of serving to deepen our understanding of the characters or move the plot forward, it feels stilted and artificial. Moments of supposed tension are undercut by clunky exchanges that elicit more laughter than suspense.

Pacing is another significant issue with the film. Instead of building tension gradually, the story lurches forward at a haphazard pace, with scenes that drag on interminably before abruptly cutting to the next. As a result, it's challenging to become emotionally invested in the characters or their predicament.

The plot twists in ""Knock Knock"" are predictable and contrived, adding little to the overall narrative. By the time the credits roll, any hope of a satisfying resolution has long since evaporated, leaving audiences feeling unsatisfied and bewildered.

From a technical standpoint, the film is also lacking. The cinematography is uninspired, the editing is choppy, and the soundtrack feels like an afterthought. It's clear that little thought or care went into the film's production, resulting in a finished product that feels sloppy and amateurish.

In conclusion, ""Knock Knock"" is a film that fails to live up to its potential. With its shallow characters, awkward dialogue, and lackluster plot, it ultimately falls flat. Even fans of the thriller genre will find little to enjoy here. Save yourself the disappointment and give this one a miss.

1.0,18 December 2018,"This is no drama thriller - instead, this is a sadistic erotic borer"
1.0,27 February 2018,I dont really know where to start. This movies is absolutely awful. I suggest you dont see it. It is waste of time. There is no story or even a flow to this movie. !! Im still upset about the time i wasted. I do believe Eli Roth should consider other career. Btw i put just one star because of Keanu Reaves.

3.0,20 October 2021,
2.0,2 December 2020,Im not sure if this movie had any potential at all. There were a couple scenes that were ok but it just felt like a huge waste of time. The acting wasn't believable. It sucks to see actors like Keanu do movies like this. The ending wasnt believable and they really should have spent a bit more time writing something decent cause it was not on a low budget.

3.0,8 March 2020,Good movie to watch for the thrilling moments that happened in one night and also l am a big fan of eli roth he makes every movie watchable.
1.0,12 January 2019,Mildly entertaining and seductive... you feel bad for Keanu.... what man would resist.... but I've never wanted to reach into the TV and punch anyone like I did with those girls!!!
1.0,24 February 2020,
3.0,1 August 2019,Is this a new way of saying do not cheat on your wife when you're not exactly cheating? what was that really? almost whole movie is boring with abslute nonsense and things. do not watch this even if you think you'll like it because of keanu because i kinda did that and the actor won't make you like it unless you see nothing but keanu. what a waste of movie with such a good actor.

1.0,18 September 2019,"I did not like it. I rarely write negative reviews. But this movie was disturbing. Although a horror movie, this story didn't scare me, but it did bother me. I do not regret watching them. But I would not recommend. Generalized story of infantile crazy girls with oedipal complex. Decorated with some sex scenes. But overall, the movie was well done. So it gets 3 stars."
2.0,15 December 2017,"This movie a remake of Death Games, a 70's campy movie. The original movie starred Colleen Camp as one of the teenage protagonists and she makes a cameo appearance as the massage therapist that shows up at the door. This remake follows the original fairly closely. The build up to the final scene was also a little too predictable but the main issue I have is with the limited character development, especially with the girls. That was also lacking in the original movie as well."
5.0,12 November 2019,"Real disappointing film in Keanu Reeves' resumé. What was he thinking?! He should've definitely passed this one up, and he would've been better off had he done so. Don't recommend, at all."
5.0,10 July 2019,"I like it for its entertainment values because it is campy and suspenseful at the same time. The acting is good from the 3 leads. But aside from that, the artistic quality of the film is nothing special. The script also leaves a lot to be desired. The themes don't really get explored nor do you feel any emotional attachment or find any character growth from the characters.

4.5/10"
5.0,3 November 2020,"You're patient. You wanna give it a chance, cause you know Keanu Reeves is a good actor, but how long can you wait until you finally accept after 45 minutes this film is going nowhere? So you pull the emergency brake and get outta there ASAP.

A good film is riveting from the get-go, within the first minute. And it never serves spaghetti stereotypes."
1.0,8 January 2019,Actresses were horrible and the directing was definitely the worst !! Too bad Reeves s have to be in here
1.0,28 May 2018,"I came across this film on Hulu and after both reading their summary and watching the trailer I did what I always do, I immediately came here to IMDb to read 'User Reviews'.

I found the standard fare of pros and more cons. This is how my review differs however, because I'm actually reviewing a review more than the actual film itself. (THIS is the reason for my preface about whether or not this is even allowed and will pass the scrutiny of the powers that be.) I DO so hope they allow it to be published because I, like tons of countless others really rely on the 'user reviews' section of IMDb to help decide upon whether or not I watch a particular film. I know we can vote whether or not we find individual reviews helpful but I want to take it a step further at least just this once. After reading through quite a few reviews I found one that really stood out. This particular review was by 'parkway-31497'. Not only did I find it very helpful but also with an excellently funny, biting sense of humor. What still stands out, so much so that I'll be sharing with friends and family, is the comments about the dog being the best part and not used nearly enough. If my gut is right and this isn't published maybe the powers that be will add a feature allowing users to search for particular reviewers so we can easily find and read other reviews by those reviewers we both like and found most helpful!"
1.0,8 September 2020,The plot of this movie is as far fetched as it gets. most movie plots would most likely never happen in real life. this movie's plot would never happen in a billion years. of course anytime ana de armas wants to knock on my door she need not hesitate. she is welcome anytime. the acting isnt bad at all. i just couldn't get into the story is all.
2.0,28 June 2019,
1.0,7 November 2020,"From the dialog to the acting to the plot to the actions by the characters to Keanu's facial hair, this was comically bad. I was at least expecting some gore given it was directed and partially written by Roth, but there was NONE. I can't imagine the actors were anything but embarrassed when they were making this thing."
4.0,25 December 2018,"""Director Eli Roth's ""Knock Knock,"" a remake of the 1977 exploitation picture ""Death Game,"" sometimes plays more like a comedy than like the grungy thriller that inspired it, but that's often all to the good."""
4.0,25 June 2020,"I actually have to admit I went into this one with my guard way up. The story description itself on Netflix tells you that you are actually going nowhere, so when I went in I was expecting a comedy, about a guy getting a 'Hall Pass' only to find that its not a comedy at all, yet its not a triller but does have those grinch worthy moments. But, if you go into it expecting that then you can skip the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, as they are just about a man and his family about to go somewhere... no one actually cares where they go.

I really dont regret watching this however, I would watch something else with my time..."
5.0,12 November 2020,"Keanu Reeves doesn't play the husband, Father like figure very well but in real life his only child he lost at birth and hasn't been married since so cut him slack. This aint John Wick. The movie itself is a horrible representation of empowering women, it embraces neofeminist facism. All in all.. I couldn't stop watching it though no matter how repulsed I was. It will keep your attention throughout the movie but fails you at the end. Too much like the original film and to implement social media while clever fails to save this movie from a moot plot. The alternate ending does bring some relief to this sad film. But all in all I finished it and it will bring some laughs in a dark twisted since. You could watch it.. or you could watch Eli Roths failed attempt at a remake of his own master piece Cabin Fever and you will have the same outcome."
1.0,17 August 2023,"I remembered watching this movie a while ago, but thought I would give it another shot as I couldn't recall the entire plot.

This has Keanu Reeves in it, who I normally enjoy watching, but about 20 minutes in I remembered why I hated it back then and nothing has changed my mind.

Essentially, the two girls are psychopaths, there is no explanation or motive for their actions. They also behave like lunatics, shoveling food into their mouths and screaming and trashing stuff like they're in an asylum and so on.

Ugh.

If you're supposed to feel like he is getting his just desserts, well, bleh.

The ending is a bad joke, although I'm sure the director thought he was being very clever."
1.0,19 October 2018,The worst movie ever. Nothing else i have to say. I dont know what they were thinking when they agree to participate.
4.0,16 June 2024,"This movie was making me so mad , I hated every scene of this.

The actor keanu reeves is one of the most talented actors, but this movie made him look so bad and how a man can't deal with 2 girls that weight like my little sisters .

Don't watch that movie.

And I just don't know what else to say, it was bad, just bad, the cringe of life. I, as a person who served in the army and see a person fighting like a girl against two weak girls with a psychopathic nature. Come and fight them from the beginning. How does it make sense that suddenly the wife leaves for vacation 2 random girls appear who need help where is the prequel why why did it make me nervous I don't know very sad bad movie I didn't enjoy it at all. I cried at the end but not emotionally out of real pain."
3.0,19 January 2019,I have never seen a movie in which the acting was zo unbelievebly bad. Those girls...
3.0,12 March 2018,"Even an animal wouldn't watch this movie , it's a waste of time literally"
3.0,16 August 2019,"Just imagine if the roles were reversed? A whole movie about how two men raped and tortured a woman. Oh the chaos that would ensue in America. The liberals would lose their s$!t. America would turn into a war zone. Every single actor, director, camera men, heck even the coffee boy on set would be blacklisted everywhere and made to live on the streets. I can't wait for the day someone makes a movie with the roles reversed. I'd move to Puerto Rico kick back on the beach on a lounge chair, a beer in my hand and watch plumes of smoke rise into the sky as America burns to the ground before my very eyes."
3.08,15 August 2018,"Everything about the movie is bad. The script, directing and the acting. Must be the worst film Reeves has ever been in."
3.08,8 December 2015,
3.08,12 January 2017,
3.08,20 November 2020,"All the pent up anger the viewer sits through, only to not have any resolution or revenge. I wondered why I just sat through that whole movie just to be left high and dry at the end, and feeling disturbed for several hours. Things like this do happen in real life, we need some thing with closure at the end. Although I found the acting to be good, unlike some of the other reviewers here, I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Like with any horror movie or thriller, it's that revenge at the end that gives you a relief from that horror. This did not do that, it just left you hanging with the horror."
3.08,19 May 2021,With a few more $ it could have been so much better.
3.08,17 September 2024,"Wow, what a terrible movie. The whole plot was predictable and boring. The acting was beyond terrible! Keanu is normally amazing bit in this.... I wanted to turn it off about 45 minutes in. I get it's a movie but it's so infuriating when the main character could have easily gotten out of all these situations with ease. There was zero mystery, nothing thrilling happened, no twist! What was the actul point of this movie? Just to waste people's time? Evan could have smashed their teeth down their throat and this would have been over with. Should have been a 25 to 30 minute movies but no we have to drag out the movies just like these review with so many characters."
3.08,9 April 2018,Watching two girls ... actresses in the mid to late twenties ... pretend to be underaged ... in a high school targeted script ... about parents ... misses on almost every level.
3.08,22 April 2019,I fast forwarded half the movie.... was boringly disturbing and annoying. What a disappointment.
3.08,21 August 2023,"Why anyone put actual money into this trash production, I will never know. Viewers beware. You will want your hour and 39 minutes back. Nothing redeeming. I thought maybe there was some interesting twist. Nope. Seriously don't bother with this. You will regret it. Literally one of the worst films I've ever seen.

I'm giggling at others' reviews on here. Believe them! I'm sorry I didn't look this up before watching this and thinking maybe it might have some clever ending. It doesn't!!

The French bulldog puppy is the only interesting part of the entire movie.

I was surprised to see that the late Sondra Locke put money into this production. Why oh why??"
3.08,14 March 2022,"In the words of the great Lieutenant Columbo (1971): I like motives; and motives there were none in this thriller(?), crime(?) uninteresting movie (although special mention goes to the super energetic acting of the two girls)."
3.08,17 May 2019,"The aspect of two women torturing as the guy is basically all thugs film has going for it. We see no real acting. Keanu is super wooden and awkward, trying to be convincing, but falling. The female leads are much to over the top, much too cartoony. There are moments I enjoyed, moments of tension, moments of humor and the motivations of the two young women are interesting, and gives the film its meaning. Unfortunately, it proves inconsistent. I have no idea when to take it seriously, therefore it all feels too much, to goofy, mostly with the none acting this is combined. Overall, a strange, over the top film with a little untrue and a little suspense, but unsure of itself."
3.08,17 September 2020,"This was absolute dreck. What motivation do ANY of the characters have beyond random insanity? Even at their most strained attempts at seduction, any sane man would fear the rampant STDs the two girls must carry. Zero chemistry between Evan and Karen. Cartoon kids. And don't get me started on poor Louis. This was some fireside spooky story at Philanderer Summer Camp. Why would Keanu do this? Did he need the money? Who thought this was a good idea?"
3.08,12 October 2021,I know this is fictional. But it is far from being close to a reality either. Just annoying not entertaining.
3.08,29 November 2020,If you are looking for horror or something fun or sort of great story this movie has nothing to give except Keanu Reeves (& Ana de Armas).
3.08,28 May 2022,
3.08,6 November 2020,Ever want to jump through the screen and-----well I can't say what I wanted to do to the 2 female leads. Which is why I'm torn in my review because the actresses were so damn good and Keanu Reeves' character so opposite John Wick that I have to give it 5 stars even though for the most part I hated this movie.
3.08,17 August 2019,This is the badest movie I can remember....We were waiting the whole time to find a kind of story but there was no chance...
3.08,30 June 2018,Worst movie ever! Worst movie ever! Worst movie ever! Worst movie ever!
3.08,19 April 2020,Cast a star and not utilize his strengths and skills.
3.08,1 July 2019,
3.08,14 May 2024,"1 star is generous. What was the point of this movie and how did Keanu read this script and think ""yeah this looks good""? Has a like 1 or 2 funny lines but overall it was boring and cringe. Seems like a lot was done for the shock factor just to distract from the terrible plot of the movie. I'm honestly shocked this movie has any good reviews at all. Nothing about it was good. The acting was not good and the script was so strange. The blonde actor just kept screaming ""daddy"" for the whole movie. Don't watch this movie. It's a waste of time and is not interesting in the least. I'm glad I never have to watch this movie again."
3.08,18 November 2020,
3.08,2 March 2016,
3.08,5 November 2020,"The villains in this story just weren't great. I would like to see why they were doing what they were doing. Get me some backstory. Did they have childhood trauma? Were they born psychopaths? How did they meet? Why did they pick him has their victim? Why were they mad at him? It's honestly so unclear and that's why they didn't make great villains. I wish we could we a deeper look into their characters. It was just a disappointment.

The story itself seemed interesting enough but the execution did not hold up. This isn't a memorable movie. I don't recommend."
3.08,23 August 2024,
3.08,8 November 2020,After seeing his John Wick films ... I really thought that this will be a great thriller too... but this by far was the most trashy film I ever saw...
3.08,15 April 2020,"If you're in the mood for a trashy, guilty pleasure (and you're careful not to set your expectations too high!) ""Knock Knock"" may have just enough mild erotica (plus a whole bunch of crazy!) to pass as acceptable entertainment time-filler! Keanu Reeves starts out the film in typical low-key ""Keanu mode"", only to ratchet things up to a far more emotive sense of desperation as dictated by the plot! The two main ladies in the movie (Ana de Armas and Lorenza Izzo) start out as seemingly benign, giggly hotties somewhat in distress! Keanu's character's helpful chivalrousness toward the ladies results in---for him---unforeseen negative consequences! Ms. Izzo is pretty good at playing an unpredictable psychotic, while the gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous Ms. de Armas (more recently seen to far better effect in the hit film ""Knives Out"") registers as a deeply troubled childlike seductress! The main weakness of the film lies in the fact that viewers of thriller movies, while unlikely to correctly guess where the plot will lead, will probably predict far better dramatic developments than what the movie actually provides! Truthfully, I only bothered with this movie at all because Ana de Armas was in it, and---from a hormonal standpoint alone, she does not disappoint (not to knock Ms. de Armas, who, when given strong material like Knives Out, proves herself to be an exceptionally capable performer!) Knock Knock, by contrast, doesn't require exceptionalism! The beauty of both actresses is something to behold, and it almost makes believable the mild, internal moral struggle of Reeves' character, but, honestly, no one is being tasked here with anything more demanding than trying to bring an essentially preposterous story to entertaining life! Even if the script isn't especially clever, the performers' full-on commitment to the crazy somewhat elevated the production overall!"
3.08,11 December 2020,"Premise, good. Execution, very bad. Stick to action movies, Keanu."
3.08,3 November 2020,"What was the girls motivation? They go around seducing men in order to get them to cheat on their wives? Why?? To test their loyalty? Why do they care? Then they felt like it's their duty to punish him, for their actions of seducing him? This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. There was absolutely no development into the motivation behind this. That alone made this whole film pointless. Not to mention the acting was horrendous."
3.08,24 June 2023,
3.08,20 December 2018,"Believe me, this movie is so bad the 3 main actors should never work again"
3.08,9 November 2019,"The opening scene with Keanu Reeves playing 'happy families' is without a doubt the most cringe worthy acting I've ever experienced. Reeves has always been a pretty wooden actor, but this won the golden prize. The equally ridiculous Lorenza Izzo's and Ana de Armas's characters, should have turned up earlier, right at the 'happy family' scene, and offed Reeves's character immediately, and then taken themselves out, to spare us the extra 90 minutes of this squirmfest.

-11/0"
3.08,8 March 2021,"I was trying to wash the bad taste out of my movie taste buds from watching "" I care for you"" this didn't help and just pretend that this is before the first John Wick and the Dark hair one is the chick he found in the contenal hotel.. so ill leave it in rated."
3.08,7 November 2020,Who writes this unbelievable garbage? And Keanu Reeves? He must not have any self respect; his dialogue was cringe worthy. Who would finance and execute this ridiculous plot? Don't waste your time on this.
3.08,17 January 2018,
3.08,18 November 2018,Only one question to keanu Reaves why? Do such movie
3.08,6 May 2020,Eli roth just go to hell . How could you .... I just waana slap you many more times to rate your movie . I wish you face this situation once in your life to feel your idea for this movie .you f..k..g
